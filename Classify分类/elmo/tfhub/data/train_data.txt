with all this stuff going down at the moment with mj ive started listening to his music watching the odd documentary here and there watched the wiz and watched moonwalker again maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent moonwalker is part biography part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released some of it has subtle messages about mjs feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad mkayvisually impressive but of course this is all about michael jackson so unless you remotely like mj in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring some may call mj an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie but mj and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of himthe actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the smooth criminal sequence and joe pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord why he wants mj dead so bad is beyond me because mj overheard his plans nah joe pescis character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno maybe he just hates mjs musiclots of cool things in this like mj turning into a car and a robot and the whole speed demon sequence also the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scenebottom line this movie is for people who like mj on one level or another which i think is most people if not then stay away it does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically mjs bestest buddy in this movie is a girl! michael jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty well with all the attention ive gave this subjecthmmm well i dont know because people can be different behind closed doors i know this for a fact he is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars i hope he is not the latter<SEP>1
the classic war of the worlds by timothy hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate h g wells classic book mr hines succeeds in doing so i and those who watched his film with me appreciated the fact that it was not the standard predictable hollywood fare that comes out every year eg the spielberg version with tom cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book obviously everyone looks for different things in a movie those who envision themselves as amateur critics look only to criticize everything they can others rate a movie on more important baseslike being entertained which is why most people never agree with the critics we enjoyed the effort mr hines put into being faithful to hg wells classic novel and we found it to be very entertaining this made it easy to overlook what the critics perceive to be its shortcomings<SEP>1
the film starts with a manager nicholas bell giving welcome investors robert carradine to primal park a secret project mutating a primal animal using fossilized dna like ¨jurassik park¨ and some scientists resurrect one of natures most fearsome predators the sabretooth tiger or smilodon scientific ambition turns deadly however and when the high voltage fence is opened the creature escape and begins savagely stalking its prey - the human visitors tourists and scientificmeanwhile some youngsters enter in the restricted area of the security center and are attacked by a pack of large pre-historical animals which are deadlier and bigger in addition a security agent stacy haiduk and her mate brian wimmer fight hardly against the carnivorous smilodons the sabretooths themselves of course are the real star stars and they are astounding terrifyingly though not convincing the giant animals savagely are stalking its prey and the group run afoul and fight against one natures most fearsome predators furthermore a third sabretooth more dangerous and slow stalks its victimsthe movie delivers the goods with lots of blood and gore as beheading hair-raising chillsfull of scares when the sabretooths appear with mediocre special effectsthe story provides exciting and stirring entertainment but it results to be quite boring the giant animals are majority made by computer generator and seem totally lousy middling performances though the players reacting appropriately to becoming foodactors give vigorously physical performances dodging the beasts runningbound and leaps or dangling over walls and it packs a ridiculous final deadly scene no for small kids by realisticgory and violent attack scenes other films about sabretooths or smilodon are the following : ¨sabretooth2002¨by james r hickox with vanessa angel david keith and john rhys davies and the much better ¨10000 bc2006¨ by roland emmerich with with steven strait cliff curtis and camilla belle this motion picture filled with bloody moments is badly directed by george miller and with no originality because takes too many elements from previous films miller is an australian director usually working for television tidal wave journey to the center of the earth and many others and occasionally for cinema the man from snowy river zeus and roxannerobinson crusoe rating : below average bottom of barrel<SEP>0
it must be assumed that those who praised this film the greatest filmed opera ever didnt i read somewhere either dont care for opera dont care for wagner or dont care about anything except their desire to appear cultured either as a representation of wagners swan-song or as a movie this strikes me as an unmitigated disaster with a leaden reading of the score matched to a tricksy lugubrious realisation of the textits questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera or for that matter a play especially one by shakespeare is about should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio; syberberg very fashionably but without the smallest justification from wagners text decided that parsifal is about bisexual integration so that the title character in the latter stages transmutes into a kind of beatnik babe though one who continues to sing high tenor -- few if any of the actors in the film are the singers and we get a double dose of armin jordan the conductor who is seen as the face but not heard as the voice of amfortas and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of batonzilla or conductor who ate monsalvat during the playing of the good friday music -- in which by the way the transcendant loveliness of nature is represented by a scattering of shopworn and flaccid crocuses stuck in ill-laid turf an expedient which baffles me in the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts but i cant think why syberberg couldnt splice in for parsifal and gurnemanz mountain pasture as lush as was provided for julie andrews in sound of musicthe sound is hard to endure the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and paralytic unfolding of the ritual someone in another review mentioned the 1951 bayreuth recording and knappertsbusch though his tempi are often very slow had what jordan altogether lacks a sense of pulse a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music -- and after half a century the orchestral sound in that set in modern pressings is still superior to this film<SEP>0
superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious 80s exploitation hooray! the pre-credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that were dealing with a serious and harrowing drama but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later were up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles rough fist-fights lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity! bo and ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sisters naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes well bo does that to his sister and judging by her dubbed laughter she doesnt mind at all sick dude! anyway as kids they fled from russia with their parents but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy a friendly smuggler took custody over them however and even raised and trained bo and ingrid into expert smugglers when the actual plot lifts off 20 years later theyre facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable white fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of white fire but it sure is a lot of fun to watch most of the time you have no clue whos beating up who or for what cause and i bet the actors understood even less but whatever! the violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded the script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly  and i wont reveal for what reason  bo needs a replacement for ingrid and fred williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes bos principal opponent is an italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film theres the obligatory were-falling-in-love montage and loads of other attractions! my god what a brilliant experience the original french title translates itself as life to survive which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie: none!<SEP>1
i dont know why people think this is such a bad movie its got a pretty good plot some good action and the change of location for harry does not hurt either sure some of its offensive and gratuitous but this is not the only movie like that eastwood is in good form as dirty harry and i liked pat hingle in this movie as the small town cop if you liked dirty harry then you should see this one its a lot better than the dead pool 45<SEP>1
this movie could have been very good but comes up way short cheesy special effects and so-so acting i could have looked past that if the story wasnt so lousy if there was more of a background story it would have been better the plot centers around an evil druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines the movie drags on and on and never clearly explains anything it just keeps plodding on christopher walken has a part but it is completely senseless as is most of the movie this movie had potential but it looks like some really bad made for tv movie i would avoid this movie<SEP>0
i watched this video at a friends house im glad i did not waste money buying this one the video cover has a scene from the 1975 movie capricorn one the movie starts out with several clips of rocket blow-ups most not related to manned flight sibrels smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast he edits in his own voice-over instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say the video curiously ends with a showing of the zapruder film his claims about radiation shielding star photography and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to grind against nasa the astronauts or american in general his science is bad and so is this video<SEP>0
a friend of mine bought this film for £1 and even then it was grossly overpriced despite featuring big names such as adam sandler billy bob thornton and the incredibly talented burt young this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole it uses tired bottom of the barrel comedic techniques - consistently breaking the fourth wall as sandler talks to the audience and seemingly pointless montages of hot girlsadam sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women when the ships resident comedian - the shamelessly named dickie due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender - is presumed lost at sea sandlers character shecker gets his big break dickie is not dead hes rather locked in the bathroom presumably sea sickperhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time<SEP>0

although i generally do not like remakes believing that remakes are waste of time; this film is an exception i didnt actually know so far until reading the previous comment that this was a remake so my opinion is purely about the actual film and not a comparisonthe story and the way it is written is no question: it is capote there is no need for more wordsthe play of anthony edwards and eric roberts is superb i have seen some movies with them each in one or the other i was certain that they are good actors and in case of eric i always wondered why his sister is the number 1 famous star and not her brother this time this certainty is raised to fact no question his play just as well as the play of mr edwards is clearly the top of all their professioni recommend this film to be on your top 50 films to see and keep on your dvd shelves<SEP>1
mr harvey lights a candle is anchored by a brilliant performance by timothy spallwhile we can predict that his titular morose up tight teacher will have some sort of break down or catharsis based on some deep down secret from his past how his emotions are unveiled is surprising spalls range of feelings conveyed is quite moving and more than he usually gets to portray as part of the mike leigh repertorywhile an expected boring school bus trip has only been used for comic purposes such as on the simpsons this central situation of a visit to salisbury cathedral in rhidian brooks script is well-contained and structured for dramatic purposes and is almost formally divided into actswere introduced to the urban british range of racially and religiously diverse kids with their uniforms i couldnt tell if this is a private or public school as they gather  the rapping black kids the serious south asians and muslims the white bullies and mean girls  but conveyed quite naturally and individually the young actors some of whom i recognized from british tv such as shameless were exuberant in representing the usual range of junior high social pressures celia imrie puts more warmth into the supervisors role than the martinets she usually has to playa break in the trip leads to a transformative crisis for some while others remain amusingly oblivious we think like the teacher portrayed by ben miles of coupling that we will be spoon fed a didactic lesson about religious tolerance but its much more about faith in people as well as god which is why the bbc showed it in england at easter time and bbc america showed it in the us over christmasnathalie press who was also so good in summer of love has a key role in mr harveys redemption that could have been played for movie-of-the-week preaching but is touching as they reach out to each other in an unexpected way unfortunately i saw their intense scene interrupted by commercialswhile it is a bit heavy-handed in several times pointedly calling this road trip a pilgrimage this quiet film was the best evocation of good will towards men than ive seen in most holiday-themed tv movies<SEP>1
i had a feeling that after submerged this one wouldnt be any better i was right he must be looking for champagne money and not care about the final product his voice gets repeatedly dubbed over by a stranger that sounds nothing like him; the editing is - well - just a grade above amateurish its nothing more than a b or c-grade movie with just enough money to hire a couple talented cameramen and an ok sound designerlike the previous poster said the problems seem to appear in post-production voice dubbing etc too bad cause the plots actually ok for a sg flickill never rent another sg flick unless he emails me asking for forgivenesstoo bad - i miss kelly lebrock--jimbo<SEP>0
note to george litman and others: the mystery science theater 3000 riff is i dont think so *breeder*my favorite riff is why were you looking at his like simply for the complete absurdity that and right well did not! over all i would say we must give credit to the mst3k crew for trying to ridicule this tv movie you really cant make much fun of the dialog; bill s was a good playwright on the other hand this production is so bad that even he would disown it a junior high school drama club could do betteri would recommend that you buy a book and read hamlet<SEP>0
stephen king adaptation scripted by king himself in which a young family newcomers to rural maine find out about the pet cemetery close to their home the father dale midkiff then finds out about the micmac burial ground beyond the pet cemetery that has powers of resurrection - only of course anything buried there comes back not quite rightbelow average horror picture starts out clumsy insulting and inept and continues that way for a while with the absolute worst element being midkiffs worthless performance it gets a little better toward the end with genuinely disturbing finale in point of fact the whole movie is really disturbing which is why i cant completely dismiss it - at least it has something to make it memorable decent supporting performances by fred gwynne as the wise old aged neighbor and brad greenquist as the disfigured spirit victor pascow are not enough to really redeem filmking has his usual cameo as the ministerfollowed by a sequel also directed by mary lambert is it any wonder that shes had no mainstream film work since410<SEP>0
`the matrix was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic but also curiously thought provoking in its `twilight zone-ish manner the general rule applies here- and this sequel doesnt match up to its predecessor worse than that it doesnt even compare with it`reloaded explodes onto the screen in the most un-professional fashion in the opening few seconds the first impression is a generally good one as trinity is shot in a dream immediately after that the film nose-dives after a disastrous first 45 minutes it gradually gains momentum when they enter the matrix and the agent smith battle takes place but it loses itself all speed when it reaches the 14-minute car chase sequence and gets even worse at the big groan-worthy twist at the end worst of all is the overlong `zion rave scene not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot but its also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance musicthe bullet-time aspect of `the matrix was a good addition but in `reloaded they overuse to make it seem boring in the first one there were interesting plot turns but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting the movie is basically just a series of stylish diversions that prevent us from realising just how empty it really is it works on the incorrect principle that bigger is better it appears that `the matrix franchise has quickly descended into the special effects drenched misfire that other franchises such as the `star wars saga havethe acting standard is poor for the most part the best character of course goes to hugo weavings `agent smith- the only one to be slightly interesting keanu reeves is the definitive neo but in all the special effects there is little room to make much of an impact academy award nominee laurence fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue carrie ann moss part as the action chick could have been done much better by any other actress a poor thrown-together movie `the matrix reloaded is a disappointment those who didnt like the first one are unlikely to flock to it this ones for die-hard fans only even in the movies own sub-genre of special effect bonanzas minority report the matrix etc this is still rather poor my imdb rating: 4510<SEP>0
ulli lommels 1980 film the boogey man is no classic but its an above average low budget chiller thats worth a look the sequel 1983s boogey man ii is ultimately a waste of time but at the very least its an entertaining one if not taken the least bit seriously now ii left the door open for another sequel and i for one wouldnt have minded seeing at least one more one day while i was browsing though the videos at a store in the mall i came across a film entitled return of the boogey man when i found out it was a sequel to the earlier films i was happy to shell out a few bucks for iti should have known better though the opening title is boogey man 3 this is no sequel to those two far superior films i named above well not totally anywaypros: ha! thats a laugh is there anything good about this hunk of cow dung lets seeit has footage from the boogey man and umits mercifully short yeah thats about itcons: where to start decisions decisions first of all this movie is a total bore it goes from one scene to the next without anything remotely interesting or scary happening the acting is stiff at best the actors are most likely friends of the director who had no acting experience whatsoever before and probably none since the plot is nonexistent and script shoddily written the direction is just plain awful the director tries to make the film look all artsy fartsy by making the camera move around lights flicker and with filters but it adds nothing the music is dull and hard to hear in parts ties to the original are botched suzanna loves character was named lacey not natalie! and the events depicted in the beginning of the original did not take place in 1978 also if this has a 3 in the title why is there no mention of what happened in ii finally this adds nothing new or interesting to either the series or the genrefinal thoughts: the people behind this waste of time and money should be ashamed of themselves its one thing if that had been an original film that was the directors first and sucked but instead its supposed to be a sequel to film that is no masterpiece but is damn sure far more interesting and entertaining than this if there ever is another sequel which i doubt it then it needs to forget this one ever happened and be handled either by lommel himself or someone who has at least some idea of how to make a decent horror filmmy rating: 15<SEP>0
this movie is one among the very few indian movies that would never fade away with the passage of time nor would its spell binding appeal ever diminish even as the indian cinema transforms into the abyss of artificially styled pop culture while drill oriented extras take to enhancing the pt styled film songsthe cinematography speaks of the excellent skills of josef werching that accentuate the monumental and cinema scope effect of the film in its entiretygone are the days of great cinema when every scene had to be clipped many times and retakes taken before finalizing it while meticulous attention was paid in crafting and editing the scenes some of its poignant scenes are filled with sublime emotional intensity like the instance when meena kumari refuses to say yes as an approval for nikah marriage bond and climbs down the hill while running berserk in traumatized frenzy at the moment raj kumar follows her and a strong gale of wind blew away the veil of kumari and onto the legs of kumarkamal amrohi shall always be remembered with golden words in the annals of indian cinemas history for endeavoring to complete this movie in a record setting 12 years he had to manage filming of some of the vital songs without meenas close ups because meena kumari the lady in the lead role was terminally ill and fighting for her life in early 1971<SEP>1
most people especially young people may not understand this film it looks like a story of loss when it is actually a story about being alone some people may never feel loneliness at this levelcheadles character johnson reflected the total opposite of sandlers character fineman where johnson felt trapped by his blessings fineman was trying to forget his life in the same perspective jada is a wonderful additive to the cast and sandler pulls tears cheadle had the comic role and was a great supporter for sandleri see oscars somewhere here a very fine film if you have ever lost and felt alone this film will assure you that youre not alonejerry<SEP>1
soylent green is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70s and still very persuasive even by todays standards although flawed and a little dated the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise typical for that time still feel very unsettling and thought-provoking this films quality-level surpasses the majority of contemporary sf flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that i personally consider classic the new york of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive with over-population unemployment an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product the only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the soylent company charlton heston in a great shape plays a cop investigating the murder of one of soylents most eminent executives and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets the script is a little over-sentimental at times and the climax doesnt really come as a big surprise still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny the riot-sequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70s cinema edward g robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and theres a great but too modest supportive role for joseph cotton baron blood the abominable dr phibes this is science-fiction in my book: a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity! no fancy space-ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet<SEP>1
michael stearns plays mike a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality he has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men thats when he loses it he believes that when women actually have sex thats when they lose any sense of innocence andor beauty so he strolls through the hollywood hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance ultimately shooting the men dead with a high-powered rifle with a scopethe seeming primary reason for this movies existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again the story comes off as more of an afterthought this is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as were treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation of course seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism for one thing mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger this is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrackthose with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another it even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds mike and renders him uncertain *how* to react it unfolds at a very slow pace but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist its a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screen710<SEP>1
this happy-go-luck 1939 military swashbuckler based rather loosely on rudyard kiplings memorable poem as well as his novel soldiers three qualifies as first-rate entertainment about the british imperial army in india in the 1880s cary grant delivers more knock-about blows with his knuckled-up fists than he did in all of his movies put together set in faraway india this six-fisted yarn dwells on the exploits of three rugged british sergeants and their native water bearer gunga din sam jaffe who contend with a bloodthirsty cult of murderous indians called the thuggee sergeant archibald cutter cary grant of the last outpost sergeant macchesney oscar-winner victor mclaglen of the informer and sergeant ballantine douglas fairbanks jr of the dawn patrol are a competitive trio of hard-drinking hard-brawling and fun-loving alpha males whose years of frolic are about to become history because ballantine plans to marry emmy stebbins joan fontaine and enter the tea business naturally cutter and macchesney drum up assorted schemes to derail ballentines plans when their superiors order them back into action with sgt bertie higginbotham robert coote of the sheik steps out cutter and macchesney drug higginbotham so that he cannot accompany them and ballantine has to replace him half of the fun here is watching the principals trying to outwit each other without hating themselves director george stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in grand style and scope as our heroes tangle with an army of thuggees lenser joseph h august received an oscar nomination for his outstanding black & white cinematography<SEP>1

looking for quo vadis at my local video store i found this 1985 version that looked interesting wow! it was amazing! very much a ken russell kind of film -quirky stylized very artistic and of course different nero was presented not so much as evil incarnate but as a wacky unfulfilled emperor who would rather have had a circus career he probably wondered why on earth he was put in the position of leading an empire -it wasnt much fun and fun is what he longed for klause maria bandaur had a tremendous time with this role and played it for all it was worth yes nero persecuted the christians with a vengeance; one of many who did so at one point one of his henchmen murmurs: no one will ever understand we were simply protecting ourselves he got that right<SEP>1
note to all mad scientists everywhere: if youre going to turn your son into a genetically mutated monster you need to give him a scarier name than paul i dont care if hes a frightening hammerhead shark with a mouthful of dagger-sharp teeth and the ability to ambush people in the water as well as on dry land give the kid a more worthy name like thor rock or tiburon because even if he eats me up i will probably just sit there laughing ha! get a load of this!!! paul the monster is ripping me to shreds!!!!! thats the worst part about this movie is this shark-thing is referred to as paul throughout the entire flick it makes what could have been a decent scary horror movie just seem silly not that there arent other campy and contrived parts of hammerhead: shark frenzy the scientists spend the entire movie wandering along this island and all of a sudden one of the girls starts itching madly from walking in the lush forest and just has to pour water on her feet to relive the itching which of course allows paul to come out of the water and kill her the one thing scifi channel did right in this movie was let the hottie live but thats a small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing movie<SEP>0
what the is this this must without a doubt be the biggest waste of film settings and camera ever i know you cant set your expectations for an 80s slasher high but this is too stupid to be true i baught this film for 089$ and i still feel the urge to go claim my money back can you imagine who hard it stinks who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations well actually you couldnt possible care less and why should you the makers of this piece of garbage sure didnt care they didnt try to create a tiny bit of tension the director stephen carpenter -- i guess its much easier to find money with a name like that also made the kindred 1986 wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did soul survivors complete crap as well but at least that one had eliza dushku this junk has the debut of daphne zuniga !!! who yeah thats right the melrose place chick her very memorable character dies about 15 min after the opening credits shes the second person to die the first victim dies directly in the first minute but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares the rest of the actorsthey dont deserve the term actors actually are completely uninteresting youre hoping they die a quick and painful deathand not only their charactersmy humble opinion = 0 10<SEP>0
intrigued by the synopsis every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover; this is not necessarily to be construed as a good sign i purchased ben and arthur without knowing a thing about it this is my second and i assure you it will be my last purchase of a culture q connection video as far as i am concerned this dvd is nothing but a blatant rip-off i do not make this observation lightly  i am a major collector of videos gay and mainstream and i can state with some authority and without hesitation that ben and arthur is quite simply the worst film i have ever sat through in my life period my collection boasts over 1600 films 93% on them on dvd and of those well over 300 are gay and lesbian themed i hardly own every gay movie ever made but i am comfortable in stating that i pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released and very often i buy videos without knowing anything about the film sometimes this makes for a pleasant surprise - aimee & jaguar its in the water urbania and normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that i stumbled upon accidentally so when i read on the box that ben and arthur concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the christian right one of my favorite subjects i decided to take the plunge sight unseen despite my previously disappointing purchase of another culture q connection title visions of sugar plums that film was pretty bad but compared to ben and arthur it viewed like gone with the wind so what was so wrong with ben and arthur plenty! to begin with the plot such as it was was totally ridiculous this film almost made me sympathetic to the christian right  we are asked to believe not only that a church would expel a member because his brother is gay but that a priest would actually set up a mob style execution of a gay couple in order to save their souls like this even makes sense the writing is so poor that many scenes make no sense at all and several plot points reflect no logic follow-up or connection to the story murder and violence seem to be acceptable ends to the gay activist right wing conflict on both sides and the acting is so bad that its difficult to imagine how anybody in this film got hired the characters who are supposed to be straight are almost without exception clearly gay - and nelly stereotypes to boot; the gay characters are neither sexy nor interesting this film is enough to put off anybody from buying gay themed videos forever and the distributors should be ashamed of themselves the only advantage this picture has over my other culture q connection purchase visions of sugarplams is that this one has a soundtrack with clear dialogue hardly a distinction since the script is so insipid that understanding the script only serves to make you more aware of how bad this film truly is it is an embarrassment to queer culture and i intend to warn everyone i possibly can before they waste their money on it at $995 this film would have been way overpriced; i understand that its soon to be re-priced under $20 which is still highway robbery i paid the original price of $2995 and i never felt more cheated in my life the only true laugh connected with this drivel is the reviews  i have seen user reviews for this film on numerous websites and there is always one or two that praise the director writer actor in such a way that its obvious that the reviewer is a friend of this ed wood wannabe how sad how desperate i just wish imdb would allow you to assign zero stars - or even minus zero if ever a film deserved it this is it<SEP>0
would anyone really watch this rubbish if it didnt contain little children running around nude from a cinematic point of view it is probably one of the worst films i have encountered absolutely dire some perv woke up one day and thought i will make a film with little girls in and call it art stick them in countryside and there isnt any need for a story or explanation of how they got there or why they dont appear to live anywhere or have parents because p*rn films dont need anything like that i would comment on the rest of the film but i havent ticked spoilers so i will just say avoid avoid avoid and find yourself a proper film to watch<SEP>0
unremarkable and unmemorable remake of an old celebrated english film although it may be overly maligned as a total disaster which it is not it never builds any tension and betrays its tv origins richard burton sleepwalks through his role and sophia lorens closed in this movie face doesnt display much passion either **<SEP>0
simon pegg plays a rude crude and often out of control celebrity journalist who is brought from england to work for a big american magazine of course his winning ways create all sorts of complications amusing fact based comedy that co stars kristen dunst looking rather grown up danny huston and jeff bridges it works primarily because we like simon pegg despite his bad behavior we completely understand why kristen dunst continues to talk to him despite his frequent screw ups i liked the film its not the be all and end all but it was a nice way to cap off an evening of sitting on the couch watching movies7 out of 10<SEP>1
faithful adaptation of witty and interesting french novel about a cynical and depressed middle-aged software engineer or something relying heavily on first-person narration but none the worse for that downbeat in a petit-bourgeois sort of way philosophical and blackly humorous the best way i could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual charles bukowski no disrespect to cb intended mordantly funny but also a bleak analysis of social and sexual relations the films great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognisable way as to make you ask: why arent other films like this one of the rare examples of a good book making an equally good film<SEP>1
eva hedy lamarr has just got married with an older man and in the honeymoon she realizes that her husband does not desire her her disappointment with the marriage and the privation of love makes eva returning to her fathers home in a farm leaving her husband one afternoon while bathing in a lake her horse escapes with her clothes and an young worker retrieves and gives them back to eva they fall in love for each other and become lovers later her husband misses her and tries to have eva back home eva refuses and fortune leads the trio to the same place ending the affair in a tragic way i have just watched extase for the first time and the first remark i have is relative to the horrible quality of the vhs released in brazil by the brazilian distributor video network: the movie has only 75 minutes running time and it seems that it was used different reels of film there are some parts totally damaged and other parts very damaged therefore the beauty of the images in not achieved by the brazilian viewer if he has a chance to find this rare vhs in a rental or for sale the film is practically a silent movie the story is very dated and has only a few lines consequently the characters are badly developed however this movie is also very daring with the exposure of hedy lamarr beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the present standards of beauty another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphoric used of flowers symbolizing the intercourse between eva and her lover the way the director conducts the scenes to show the needs and privation of eva is very clear the non-conclusive end is also very unusual for a 1933 movie i liked this movie but i hope one day have a chance to see a 87 minutes restored version my vote is eighttitle brazil: êxtase ecstasy<SEP>1
even if this film was allegedly a joke in response to critics its still an awful film if one is going to commit to that sort of thing at least make it a good jokefirst off jeroen krabbé is i guess the poor mans gerard depardieunaturally i hate gerard depardieu even though he was very funny in the iron mask three musketeer one otherwise to me he is box office poison and jeroen krabbé is worse than that the poor mans box office poisonreally that is not being fair to the economically disenfranchised if the 4th man is supposed to be some sort of critique of the bourgeoisiewhat am i saying it isnt lets just say hypothetically if it was supposed to be it wasnt sharp enough satire is a tricky thingif it isnt sharp enough the viewer becomes the butt of the joke insteadi think that is what happened the story just ends up as a bunch of miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not in an interesting way eitherfor a more interesting and worthwhile application see any luis bunuel filmvery sharp satire[potential spoiler alert]really the blow job in the cemetery that jeroen krabbés character works so so hard to attain do you even care is it funny since mr voerhoven is supposed to be a good film maker i will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was some misanthropic joke that got out of controlthough im guessing he didnt cast jeroen krabbé because hes the worst actor and every character hes played has been a pretentious bourgeois ass except hes incompetent at it so it becomes like a weird caricature do you think mr voerhoven did that on purpose and jeroen krabbé is the butt of the joke as well i just dont see it so you understand the dilemma im faced with here right it is the worst film ever because hes supposed to be a good director so there is some kind of dupery involved i knew patch adams was horrible without even seeing it do not be duped by the 4th mans deceptively alluring packaging or mr voerhovens reputation as a good director etc etc<SEP>0
if you are looking for eye candy you may enjoy sky captain sky captain is just a video game injected with live performers the visials are nice and interesting to look at during the entire movie now saying that the visuals are the only thing good in sky captainafter ten minutes i knew i was watching one of the worse movies of all time i was hoping this movie would get better but it never achieved any degree of interest after thirty minutes the urge to walk out kept growing and growing now i own over 2000 movies and have seen probably five times that number yet this is only the second movie i felt like walking out of my entire lifeacting---there is none the three main performers are pitiful jude law also in the other movie i wanted to walk out on is just awful in the title role i would rather sit through ben affleck in gigli than watch law againpaltrow tries so hard to be campy that it backfires in her face the last article i had read said that paltrow is thinking of staying home and being a mother rather than acting after this performance i would applaud that decisionstory---soap operas are better written the story behind sky captain starts out bad and gets continually worse as it progressesdirecting---none everything was put into the special effects that story acting and directing suffer greatly even the phantom menace had better acting and that is not saying a great deali would have to give this movie a 0 out of 10 avoid paying theatre prices and wait until video release<SEP>0
although at one point i thought this was going to turn into the graduate i have to say that the mother does an excellent job of explaining the sexual desires of an older womanim so glad this is a british film because hollywood never would have done it and even if they had they would have ruined it by not taking the time to develop the charactersthe story is revealed slowly and realistically the acting is superb the characters are believably flawed and the dialogue is sensitive i tried many times to predict what was going to happen and i was always wrong so i was very intrigued by the storyi highly recommend this movie and i must confess ill forever look at my mom in a different light!<SEP>1
dumb is as dumb does in this thoroughly uninteresting supposed black comedy essentially what starts out as chris klein trying to maintain a low profile eventually morphs into an uninspired version of the three amigos only without any laughs in order for black comedy to work it must be outrageous which play dead is not in order for black comedy to work it cannot be mean spirited which play dead is what play dead really is is a town full of nut jobs fred dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of billy bob thorntons character from a simple plan while jake busey does a pretty fair imitation of well jake busey - merk<SEP>0
i found this movie quite by accident but am happy that i did kenneth branaghs performance came close to stealing this movie from helena bonham carter but their strong chemistry together made for a much more enjoyable movie this movie brought to mind the excellent movies that branagh made with emma thompson carters star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as i have seen from a female lead in a long time portraying a disabled person is hard to pull off but with basically only her eyes to show her pain about her situation in life she made it so believable if this movie had come out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women uglying themselves up for roles charlize theron halle berry i fell sure carter would have had strong consideration for an oscar if you run across this movie on cable late at night as i did trust me it is worth the lost sleep<SEP>1
ill dispense with the usual comparisons to a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic new yorker persona because quite frankly to draw comparisons with bumbling loser josh kornbluth is just an insult to any such director i will also avoid mentioning the spot-on satire `office space in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe i can however compare it to waking up during your own surgery  its painful to watch and you wonder whether the surgeons really know what theyre doing haiku tunnel is the kind of film you wish theyd pulled the plug on in its early stages of production it was cruel to let it live and as a result audiences around the world are being made to sufferthe films premise  if indeed it has one  is not even worth discussing but for the sake of caution i will josh kornbluth a temp worker with severe commitment-phobia is offered a permanent job his main duty is to mail out 17 high priority letters for his boss but ludicrously he is unable to perform this simple task my reaction big deal! thats not a story its a passing thought at best - one that shouldve passed any self-respecting filmmaker by the leading actor  if you can call him that  is a clumsy buffoon of a man with chubby features a receding untamed hairline and a series of facial expressions that range from cringe-making to plain disturbing where o where did the director find this schmuck whats that you say he is the director oh my mistake playing yourself in your own embarrassment of a screenplay is one thing but i suspect that mr kornbluth isnt that convincing as a human being let alone an actor rest assured this is by no means an aimless character assassination but never before have i been so riled up by an actors on-screen presence! my frustration was further confounded by his incessant to-camera monologues in between scenes i mean as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to comprehend this drivel kornbluth insults us further by `explaining the action first rule of filmmaking: `dramatize exposition show dont tell who does this guy think he is he has no charisma no charm and judging by his hawaiian shirts no sense of style his casting agent should be shot point blank!the supporting actors do nothing to relieve the intense boredom i felt with but one exception patricia scanlon puts in a very funny appearance as helen the ex-secretary who has been driven insane by her old boss and makes harassing phone calls from her basement while holding a flashlight under her face this did make me chuckle to myself but the moment soon passed and i was back to checking my watch for the remainder of the filmthe films title is also a misnomer haiku tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of japanese poetry dont be fooled into thinking this is an art house film because of its pretentious-sounding title or the fact that it only played in a handful of cinemas and made no money at the box office theres a very good reason for that!<SEP>0
at first sight this movie doesnt look like a particular great one after all a bette davis movies with only 166 votes on imdb and a rating of 65 must be a rather bad one but the movie turned out to be a delightful and original surpriseyou would at first expect that this is a normal average typical 30s movie with a formulaic love-story but the movie is surprisingly well constructed and has an unusual and original story which also helps to make this movie a very pleasant one to watchthe story is carried by its two main characters played by bette davis and george brent their helped by a cast of mostly amusing characters but the movie mainly involves just around them two their character are involved in a most unusual and clever written love-story that work humorous as well it makes this movie a delightful little comedy to watch that is perfectly entertainingthe movie is quite short just over an hour long which means that the story doesnt waste any time on needless plot lines development and characters it makes the movie also rather fast paced which helps to make this movie a perfectly watchable one by todays standards as well it does perhaps makes the movie a bit of a simple one at times but this never goes at the expense of its entertainment or funa delightful pleasant simple romantic-comedy that deserves to be seen by more!810<SEP>1
well then what is it! i found nicholsons character shallow and most unfortunately uninteresting angelica hustons character drained my power and kathleen turner is a filthy no good slut its not that i dont get it its not that i dont think that some of the ideas couldve lead to something more this is a film with nothing but the notion that were supposed to accept these ideas and thats what the movie has going for it that nicholson falls for turner is absurd but then again it is intended to be so this however does not strike me as afunny or beven remotely interesting!!! this was a waste of my time so dont let the hype get the best of youit is a waste of your time! with all that being said the opening church sequence is quite beautiful<SEP>0

i dont know who sue kramer the director of this film is but i have a strong suspicion that a she is a lesbian and b she somehow shamed everyone involved in this project to participate to prove they are not homophobici can imagine everyone thinking my god this is horrible not funny pedestrian totally lame but keeping their mouths shut for fear they will be labeled anti-gay or they dont get the gay lifestyle this is probably why kramer did not cast gay people to play gay people too anyway its not even worth reviewing the actors are all directed to play every scene completely over the top so there is no sincerity or believability in anything they do its full of clichés and there is nothing about this movie that is the least bit amusing - much less funnyi hated it and im not afraid to say so too bad the gutless people who gave kramer the money to make this bomb werent as unbiased in their judgment<SEP>0
i just watched this movie on starz let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved; the acting writing directing special effects camera crew sound and lighting it also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie apparently back in 2007 when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for $75 million now-a-days those things cost about $3 billion and they cant go invisible apparently you can fly from the us to the middle east in an hour there was a completely random lesbian scene which i didnt mind but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it the camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes oh yeah since its a steven segal movie its predictable as hell all in all i rank it right up there with snakes on a plane<SEP>0
i loved the episode but seems to me there should have been some quick reference to the secretary getting punished for effectively being an accomplice after the fact while i like when a episode of columbo has an unpredictable twist like this one its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode along with the uncovering of the murdererthe interplay between peter falk and ruth gordon is priceless at one point gordon playing a famous writer makes some comment about being flattered by the famous lt columbo making a tongue-in-cheek allusion to the detectives real life fame as a crime-solver this is one of the best of many great columbo installments<SEP>1
this film is a massive yawn proving that americans havent got the hang of farce even when it has already been written for them! the original film hodet over vannet is a witty comedy of errors that i would rate 810 it isnt just about a linguistic translation but certain absurd chains of events are skipped entirely robbing the film of its original clever farcical nature and turning it into a cheap oops there go my trousers style of farce<SEP>0
i was at the same screenwriters conference and saw the movie i thought the writer - sue smith - very clearly summarised what the film was about however the movie really didnt need explanation i thought the themes were abundantly clear and inspiring a movie which deals with the the ability to dare to face fear - especially fear passed down from parental figures - and overcome it and in doing so embrace lifes possibilities is a film to be treasured and savoured i enjoyed it much more than the much-hyped somersault i also think mandy62 was a bit unkind to hugo weaving as a bloke about his vintage i should look so good! i agree that many australian films have been lacklustre recently but peaches delivers the goods im glad i saw it<SEP>1
when i saw the previews for this movie i didnt expect much to begin with - around a second rate teen horror movie but wow this movie was absolutely awful and thats being generousfirst of all the casting for the movie was terrible you feel no sympathy or for that matter any morbid feeling for the characters the acting was so terrible that i was just simply waiting and hoping for the god-awful thing to endsecondly there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever can somebody please explain to me why the girlish-looking boy starts screaming pancakes!!! at the top of his lungs while going into jackie chan moves ive never seen before and even further biting the guy who has the virus why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virus-infected guy and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him i was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that i literally said out loud where the hell did that come fromi just simply couldnt believe what i had seen i really thought i had seen some bad movies but i have to say that cabin fever tops them all this movie made me want to puke and then puke again then blow my brains outplease save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive watching grass grow perhaps is a proper alternative<SEP>0
okay sorry but i loved this movie i just love the whole 80s genre of these kind of movies because you dont see many like this one anymore! i want to ask all of you people who say this movie is just a rip-off or a cheesy imitation what is it imitating ive never seen another movie like this one well not horror anywaybasically its about the popular group in school who like to make everyones lives living hell so they decided to pick on this nerdy boy named marty it turns fatal when he really gets hurt from one of their little pranksso its like 10 years later and the group of friends who hurt marty start getting high school reunion letters butthey are the only ones receiving them! so they return back to the old school and one by one get knocked off byyeah you probably know what happens!the only part that disappointed me was the very end it could have been left off or thought out betteri think you should give it a try and try not to be to critical!~*~cupidgrl~*~<SEP>1
stephane rideau was already a star for his tour de force in wild reeds and he is one of frances biggest indie stars in this film he plays cedric a local boy who meets vacationing mathieu newcomer jamie elkaim in a stunning nuanced ethereal performance at the beach mathieu has a complex relationship with his ill mother demanding aunt and sister with whom he has a competitive relationship soon the two are falling in lovethe films fractured narrative -- which is comprised of lengthy flash-backs bits and pieces of the present and real-time forward-movement into the future -- is a little daunting director sebastien lifshitz doesnt signal which time-period we are in and the story line can be difficult to follow but stick it out: the films final 45 minutes are so engrossing that you wont be able to take your eyes off the screen by turns heart-breaking and uplifting this film ranks with beautiful thing as must-see cinema<SEP>1
though it had the misfortune to hit the festival circuit here in austin sxsw film just as we were getting tired of things like shakespeare in love and elizabeth this movie deserves an audience an inside look at the staging of the scottish play as actors call macbeth when producing it to avoid the curse this is a crisp efficient and stylish treatment of the treachery which befalls the troupe with a wonderfully evocative score and looking and sounding far better than its small budget would suggest this is a quiet gem not world-class but totally satisfying<SEP>1
yikes this is pretty bad the play isnt great to begin with and the decision to transfer it to film does it no favours - especially as peploe doesnt decide how she wants to treat the materials theatrical origins we get occasional glances of an observing theatre audience etc and has decided to go with a jumpy editing style that is intended to keep reminding you that youre watching a film whereas in fact it only serves to remind you that you are watching a very poor film by a director who is overwhelmed by her material mira sorvinos central performance is breath-takingly poor: stage-y and plummy its as if shes playing the part via helena bonham-carters merchant ivory oeuvre only fiona shaw delivers a performance of note - and it may be that her theatrical pedigree means that she is best able to handle the material - but its hard to watch a film for one performance alone even if that performance is as light truthful and entire as shaws ben kingsley turns in an average and disengaged turn and diana riggs daughter rachel stirling plays her supporting role as just that sadly none of bertoluccis magic has rubbed off on his wife if this film is to be the evidence<SEP>0
last week i took a look at the weekly nielsen ratings and there was veronica mars supposedly the best show youre not watchingwell theyre right that youre not watching it it aired twice and was ranked 147 and 145 out of 147translation: this is the lowest-rated show on any nationally broadcast network and deservedly so i tried to watch it a couple of times because of all the press coverage hyping it as a great show a realistic look at life and all such nonsense the reality was otherwise veronica mars is a bore its as unrealistic as it gets and it richly deserves to be canceledthe only mystery is why cw felt compelled to put on its inaugural schedule the lowest-rated show in memory after two years of continued commercial and artistic failure<SEP>0
what an absolutely crappy film this is how or why this movie was made and what the hell billy bob thornton and charlize theron were doing signing up for this mediocre waste of time is beyond me strong advise for anyone sitting down to catch a flick: do not waste your time on this film<SEP>0
elizabeth ward gracen who will probably only be remembered as one of bill clintons bimbo eruptions they have pills for that now! is probably the weakest element of this show it really continues the tired formula of the highlander series- the hero immortal encounters another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met but there is some conflict and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap special effects sequencethen you have the character of nick wolf basically your typical unshaven 90s hero with the typical sexual tension storyline seriously why do you hollywood types think sexual tension is more interesting than sex this was a joint canadianfrench production so half the series takes place in vancouver imitating new york and the other half is in paris just like highlander did<SEP>0
they all laughed is a superb peter bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves and why their are many reasons the fact that its set in new york which truly sets the tone the fantastic soundtrack the appealing star turns from ben gazzara and the late john ritter who is superb and of course no classic is complete without audrey hepburn the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties film is essentially about the odyssey detective agency which is run by gazzara who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric blaine novakthe films co-producer and john ritter basically the gazzara falls for a rich tycoon magnates wifehepburn and ritter falls for beautiful dorothy stratten who sadly murdered infamously after production they all laughed is essential viewing for bogdanovich fans<SEP>1
what a stunning episode for this fine series this is television excellence at its best the story takes place in 1968 and its beautifully filmed in black & white almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and stark images this is a story about two men who fall in love but i dont want to spoil this it is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in america written by the superb tom pettit and directed by the great jeannot szwarc we move through their lives their love for each other and their tragedy taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters chills ran up my spine at the end when they played bob dylans gorgeous ah but i was so much older then im younger than that now as sung by the byrds this one goes far past a 10 and all the way to the stars beautiful<SEP>1
this movie was ok but it could have been much better there are some spooky moments but there arent enough of them to make me ever want to see this movie again there are some scenes you could fast forward through & not miss anything the biggest flaw is that it is so predictable & that is the reason why i rated it so low its watchable but dont expect anything great<SEP>0
as i understand it after the chinese took over hong kong the infamous cat 3 hong kong movies kind of disappeared at least until now and what an amazing movie this one is i knew it was a rough crime drama going in but being the first cat 3 ive purchased thats been made recently i wasnt sure what to expecta cambodian hit-man goes to hong kong to knock off the wife of a judge who is also a lawyer turns out the judge made the arrangements for the hit-man because she was divorcing the judge and threatening to take all his money this is all known within the first ten minutes so nothing is being given away after the hit the cops locate the hit-man pretty fast but in trying to arrest him several police officers and civilians are killed he eludes the police and now the race is on to catch the guy before he escapes back to cambodia this is a movie that never stops and hardly gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath yes it is very violent and intense many cops are killed as the hit-man proves very very hard to track and take down when they do locate him along the way the hit-man in trying to hide in a dump finds a women being raped and mistreated by some man he helps her and saves her from the guy and she persuades the hit-man to take her along with him in his escape i loved this movie its like a roller-coaster that just keeps moving and moving at high speed as one incident leads to another and the police at times are just as bad or worse as the hit-man the acting is exceptionally good and the location filming and photography is at time breathtaking theres no let up in this movie not even with the very very incredible ending the ending is pretty much unbelievable and also a fitting end to all the action and violence yes the violence is brutal at times but this is a very no nonsense crime drama that will knock your socks off dog eat dog definitely needs a more widespread release including an r1 release for sure great movie highly recommended<SEP>1
yes this is a horror anthology film and it was a lot of fun! thats because although the film clearly was horror some of the stories had a light spirit--and there were even occasionally a few laughs this isnt at all a bad thing as sometimes horror films are a bit stuffy and overly serious because of this and because all four of the stories were pretty good its one of the better movies of this style i have seenthe unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself four different stories involve people who either rent the home or investigate what happened to the tenantsthe first segment starred denholm elliott as a horror writer who has writers block so for a change of scenery they rent this house almost immediately elliotts block vanishes and he works steadily on a tale about a serial killer amazingly soon after his block vanishes he begins to actually see his fictional character! again and again the psychotic killer appears and then disappears--making it seem as if he is losing his mind this might just be the best of the stories as the nice twist ending makes the story come alivethe second while not bad at all is probably the weakest peter cushing plays a bachelor who is pining for a girl friend who died some time ago though the picture of her looked amazingly contemporary when he enters a chamber of horrors wax museum in town he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost lady and he is both fascinated and scared by this later a friend joss ackland visits and he too sees the figure and is entranced by it this all leads to an ending that frankly was a bit of a letdownchristopher lee then stars as an incredibly harsh and stern father to a pathetic little girl during most of this segment lee seemed like an idiot but in the end you can understand his demeanor though slow this one ended very wellthe fourth segment was the silliest and was meant to parody the genre jon pertwee the third doctor from the dr who television series is a very temperamental actor known for his portrayals of dracula however nothing is right about the film according to him and in a fit of pique he stomps off the set to find better props for this vampire film its actually pretty interesting that he played this role as it seemed like a natural for christopher lee who played dracula or other vampires a bazillion times give or take a few i enjoyed pertwees line when he basically said that lees and other recent incarnations of dracula were all crap compared to bela lugosis! perhaps this is why lee didnt take this part! despite some very silly moments it was very entertaining and fun--possibly as good or better than the first segmentconsidering that the film started and ended so well had excellent acting and writing its hard not to like this film<SEP>1
a charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town cats and death soon follow them that about sums it upill admit that i am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie but in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film and believe me there is plenty of that to go around it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experiencethe characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on fear greed pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people although it can be argued that that seeming failing in actuality serves the telling of the story the supernatural premise and the fact that it is a stephen king screenplaynot that i have anything specific against mr king are quite nicely supported by some interesting fx work makeup and quite suitable music the absolute gem of this film is without a doubt alice krige who plays mary brady the otherworldly motherking manages to take a simple story of outsider or people who are a little differentokay - a lot in this case trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan<SEP>0
i rented this movie because it falls under the genres of romance and western with some grand canyon scenery thrown in but if youre expecting a typical wholesome romantic western forget it this movie is pure trash! the romance is between a young girl who has not even gone through puberty and a middle-aged man! the child is also lusted after by other leering men its sickeningpeter fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to brooke shields and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship he tries to shoo her off at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy loving couple its revoltingi dont see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles<SEP>0
i first saw this film as a teenager it was at a time when heavy metal ruled the world trick or treat has every element for a movie that rocks with a cast that features skippy from family ties gene simmons of kiss and ozzy osbourne as a preacher how can you go wrong backwards evil messages played on vinyl! yes thats right they use records in this movie in one scene eddie skippy is listening to a message from the evil rockstar on his record player when things begin to get scary monsters start to come out of his speakers and his stereo becomes possessed as a teenager i tried playing my records backwards hoping it would happen to mine almost 20 years later trick or treat is still one of my all time favorite movies<SEP>1
it is so sad even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like blood lake theres nothing out there & the music they play in this is the funniest stuff ive ever heard i like the brother and sister in this movie they both dont try very hard to sound sarcastic when theyre saying stuff like my friends are going to be so jealous! hey whats with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning thats retarded! i practically ignored the second half of this my favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe the same exact sound for every chop!<SEP>0

warning: possible spoilers but not really - keep reading ahhh there are so many reasons to become utterly addicted to this spoof gem that i wont have room to list them all the opening credits set the playful scene with kitsch late 1950s cartoon stills; an enchanting peres prez prado mambo theme which appears to be curiously uncredited but his grunts are unmistakable and no-one else did them; and with familiar cast names including kathy najimi a full year before she hit with sister acts 1 & 2 plus teri hatcher from tvs supermanevery scene is imbued with shallow injustices flung at various actors actresses and producers in daytime tv peeking behind the careers of these people is all just an excuse for an old-fashioned delicious farce robert harling penned this riotous spoof that plays like an issue of mad magazine but feels like a gift to us in the audience some of the cliched characters are a bit dim but everyone is drizzling with high jealousy especially against celeste talbert sally field who is the shows perennial award-winning lead nicknamed americas sweetheart the daytime emmies-like awards opening does introduce us to celestes show the sun also sets against all vain fears to the contrary celeste wins again she is overjoyed because its always such a genuine thrill: adam did you watch i won!

i was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable the plot was weak to say the least i was expecting a lot more considering the cast line up i wonder if any of them will include this on their cvs at least i didnt pay to rent it the best part of the film is definitely dani behr but the rest of the film is complete and utter pants<SEP>0
the king of masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship set in 1930s china during a time of floods we meet wang an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him when a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends wang he invites wang to join their troupe however we learn that wangs family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son learning that wang is childless wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever taking the advice to heart wang purchases an 8 year old to fulfill his legacy; he would teach his new son doggie the ancient art of silk masks soon wang discovers a fact about doggie that threatens the rare and dying arttogether wang and doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it the story is absorbing the setting is serene and the costuming simple summarily it is an international award winning art film which cant help but to move and inspire<SEP>1
i really wanted to like this film but the story is ridicules i dont want to spoil this film - dont worry right from the begin you know something bad is going to happen - but heres an example of how sloppy this film was put together the cowboy and twig ride up the ridge the cowboy has a handle bar mustache the cowboy and twig get into a shoot out and race half way down the ridge the cowboy is clean shaven through out the rest of the film sometime between the gun fight and the ride down the mountain the cowboy has had time to shave in dark on the back of a horseto be fair the acting by the four main characters is solid<SEP>0
i am a big fan of cinema verite and saw this movie because i heard how interesting it was i can honestly say it was very interesting indeed the two lead actors are awesome the film isnt ever boring and the concept behind it though obviously inspired by the columbine killings and the home movies of the killers is really interesting there are some weaknesses such as the final 20 minutes which really detracts from the realism seen in the first hour or so and the ending really doesnt make any sense at all the shaky camera sometimes can be a distraction but in cinema verite that is a given but i still think the movie is very well done and the director ben coccio deserves some credit<SEP>1
how do i begin to review a film that will soon be recognized as the `worst film of all time by the `worst director of all time a film that could develop a cult following because its `so bad its goodan analytical approach criticizing the film seems both pointless and part of band-wagon syndrome--lets bash freely without worry of backlash because every other human on earth is doing it and the people who like the film like it for those flaws wed citethe films universal poor quality goes without saying-- sixteen years of alcohol is not without competition for title of worst film so it has to sink pretty low to acquire the title and keep a hold of it but i believe this film could go the distance imdb doesnt allow enough words to cite all the films failures and it be much easier to site the elements sixteen years of alcohol does right unfortunately those moments of glory are so far buried in the shadows of this films poorness that thats a task not worth pursuingmy impressions i thought i knew what i was getting into i had been warned to drink several cups of coffee before sitting down to watch this one wish that suggestion had been cups of vodka despite my low expectations sixteen years of alcohol failed to entertain me even on a `make fun of the bad movie level not just bad but obnoxiously bad as though jobson intentionally tried to make this film a poetical yawn but went into overkill and shoved the poetry down our throats making it not profound but funny and supposedly jobson sincerely tried to make a good movie even after viewing the sixteen years of alcohol promotional literature i have trouble believing jobsons sincerity pointless and obnoxious till the end with a several grinchuckle moments all im sure none intentionalspiced the film and those few elements prevented me from turning the dvd off so bad its good no it had just enough i cant believe this is a serious movie moments to keep me from turning it off and nothing moredefinitely a film to watch with a group of bad-movie connoisseurs get your own running commentary going that wouldve significantly improved the experience for me so bad its mike myers commentating in his cod scottish accent on it as it runs to turn this whole piece of sludge into a comic farce ok dare ma man pass me annuder gliss of dat wiskey<SEP>0

as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates barely even reaching feature length can i do ittill i need glasses is a collection of mostly dirty jokes many of them are so short that you cant believe it when you realize that that was supposed to be the punchline example: the santa claus gag; others are so long that you cant believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up that punchline example: the students awards gag and nearly all are directed without any artistry dont get me wrong: about 1 every 10 jokes actually manages to be funny the iron phone one is probably my favorite there is also some wonderful full-frontal nudity that proves yet again that the female body especially in its natural form is the best thing on this planet there is some comedic male nudity as well and i agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is actually pretty damn catchy! but none of those reasons are enough to give this film anything more than * out of 4<SEP>0
i have been a huge lynn peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the 1988 blockbuster movie far north and even though i loved her in her one other film slow 2004 where she plays francis this is by far and away her strongest rolelynn as im sure you all know or should plays the critical role of driverunfortunately other than lynns amazing performance im afraid this movie doesnt really have much going for itoh wait - there was one other thing - the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for tv viewers memorable lines like: you son-of-a-gun! you son-of-a-witch! shoot! and well forget you!ok byeps: does anyone know where i can get another lynn peterson poster<SEP>0
often laugh out loud funny play on sex family and the classes in beverly hills milks more laughs out of the zip code than its seen since the days of granny and jed clampett plot centers on two chauffers whove bet on which one of them can bed his employer both single or soon to be single ladies quite sexy -- bisset and woronov first if manuel wins his friend will pay off his debt to a violent asian street gang -- if he loses he must play bottom man to his friend! lots of raunchy dialogue fairly sick physical humour etc but a lot of the comedy is just beneath the surface bartel is memorable as a very sensual oder member of the family who ends up taking his sexy teenaged niece on a year long missionary trip to africahilarious fun<SEP>1
some very interesting camera work and a story with much potential but it never comes together as anything more than a students graduate thesis in film schoolthere are two primary reasons for this fist there is not a single likable character not even a villain we might admire for hisher chutzpah secondly all the acting is awful - even from veteran willem dafoe the ham is so plentiful here you feel like youre at a picnic - but one of those wretched company employee picnics where you drink too much cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking then you eat an underdone hotdog and throw upall right im being a little rough on a young director who might still go places - as i said the camera work is quite goodbut i feel cheated - the blurb for this film suggests we will get to watch a modern western and the dvd packaging has pictures on it that suggest this as well - but nobody actually connected to the films making seems to know that this is the kind of film theyre supposed to be makingthat betrayal is what hurts; but even without it the fact remains that we dont like these characters we feel embarrassed for the actors the story is hopelessly muddled and in the last analysis we just dont carei took it out of the dvd player about half way through but the rental store wouldnt give me my money backnow that really hurts<SEP>0
the original demille movie was made in 1938 with frederic march a very good film indeed hollywoods love of remakes brings us a fairly interesting movie starring yul brynner he of course was brilliant as he almost always seemed to be in all of his movies charlton heston as andrew jackson was a stroke of genius however the movie did tend to get a little long in places it does not move at the pace of the 1938 version still it is a fun movie that should be seen at least once<SEP>1
before watching this movie i thought this movie will be great as flashpoint because before watching this movie flashpoint was the last jenna jameson and brad armstrong movie i previously watched as far as sexual scenes are concerned i was disappointed i thought sexual scenes of dreamquest will be great as flashpoint sexual scenes but i was disappointed except asia carreras sexual scene any sexual scene in this movie doesnt make me feel great you know what i mean the great jenna jameson doesnt do those kind of sexual scenes of what she is capable of felecia and stephanie swift both of those lovely girls disappoint me as well as far as sexual scenes are concernedalthough its a adult movie but if you aside that sexual scenes factor this movie is very good if typical adult movie standards are concerned this movie definitely raised the standards of adult movies story acting direction sets makeups and other technical stuff of this movie are really great the actors of this movie done really good acting they all done a great job dreamquest is definitely raised the bar of quality of adult movies<SEP>1

those who are not familiar with cassandra petersons alter-ego elvira then this is a good place to startelvira mistress of the dark starts off with our heroine with the gravity defying boobs receiving a message it seems that a great aunt of hers has died and that she needs to be present for the reading of the will anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in las vegas she decides to go in hopes of getting lots and lots of moneyunfortunately the place she has to go is the town of fallwell massachusetts having to stay a spell due to her car breaking down she finds out that her great aunt left her 3 things: a house a dog and a cookbook the town residents have mixed reactions:the teens like her the women hate her and the men lust after her although trying to remain moral pillars of the community her worst problem turns out to be her great uncle vincent w morgan sheppard because he wants her cookbook seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful warlockthe film is actually pretty funny with peterson aka elvira using her endowments and sexiness as a joke and dont forget tomorrow were showing the head with two things i mean the thing with two heads especially funny as edie mcclurg as chastity pariah the woman that works her hardest to keep the town in line but ends up looking ridiculous the picnic scene is the perfect example deserves a peek the film not her boobs of course<SEP>1

there are movies like plan 9 that are so bad they have a charm about them there are some like waterworld that have the same inexplicable draw as a car accident and there are some like desperate living that you hate to admit you love cowgirls have none of these redemptions the cast assembled has enough talent to make almost any plot watchable and from what ive been told the book is enjoyablehow then could this movie be so intolerably bad to begin with it seems the director brought together a cast of names with no other tie than what will bring in the 20 somethings then tell them to do their best kevin costner imitations open the book at random and start shooting whatever is on the page making sure to keep the wide expanses of america from being interesting in any way finally give the editing job to your brother-in-law because the meat packing plant just laid him off he does have twenty years of cutting experiencethis movie now defines the basement for me it is so bad it isnt even good for being bad<SEP>0
and im serious! truly one of the most fantastic films i have ever had the pleasure of watching whats so wonderful is that very rarely does a good book turn into a movie that is not only good but if possible better than the novel it was based on perhaps in the case of lord of the rings and trainspotting but it is a rare occurrence indeed but i think that the fact that louis sachar was involved from the beginning helped masses so that the film sticks close to the story but takes it even further this film has many elements that make it what it is:1 a unique original story with a good mix of fun and humour but a mature edge 2 brilliant actors adults and kids alike these actors know how to bring the story to life and deliver their lines with enthusiasm and style without going overboard as sometimes happen with kids movies 3 breathtaking scenery and it doesnt matter if its real or cgi the setting in itself is a masterpiece i especially love the image of the holes from a birds eye view 4 a talented director who breathes life into the book and turns it into technicolour genius the transitions in time work well and capture the steady climax from the book leading up to the twists throughout the film 5 louis sachar! the guy who had me reading a book nonstop from start to finish so that i couldnt put it down he makes sure that the script sticks to the book with new bits added in to make it even better 6 and speaking of the script! the one-liners in this are smart funny and unpatronising but there are also parts to make you smile make you cry and tug at your heartstrings to make you love this story all the more 7 beautiful soundtrack theres not a song in this film that i havent fallen for and thats something considering im supposed to be a punk-rocker the songs link to the story well and add extra jazz to the overall style of the film if youre going to buy the film i recommend you buy the soundtrack too especially for if only which centres around the story and contains the chorus from the booki do not work for the people who made holes by the way im just a fan plugging my favourite film and giving it the review it deserves if you havent seen it do it now this very instant go!<SEP>1
channel surfing and caught this on logo it was one of those i have to watch this because its so horribly bad moments like roadhouse without the joy the writing is atrocious; completely inane and the acting is throw-up-in-your-mouth badtheres low budget and then there is the abyss which is where this epic should be tossed and never seen from again i mean the main characters go to a ski retreat in some rented house and the house is well ordinary which is no big deal but they choose to show all the houseguests pouring over it like it was the sistine chapel im sorry but watching 6 guys stare into every 10x10 boring room with a futon in it and gushing is lame i guess they didnt learn anything from the bad news bears in breaking training see hotel room check scenewow a toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! i dont buy the its all over the top so anything goes routine if it smells likeand it looks likewell you know the restavoid like the plagueedit: apparently other more close minded reviewers believe that since i disliked this movie i am an obvious hater which i can only assume means i am phobic which of course is not true i decided to do this wacky crazy thing and judge the movie based on the actual content of the film and not by its mere presence ie its refreshing to seesure it may be refreshing to see but that doesnt equate into a great movie just give them some better material to work with and tighter direction in fact i applaud the effort frankly id rather go listen to my kitchens of distinction catalogue than watch this again<SEP>0
when i first saw the romeo division last spring my first reaction was brilliant! however on future viewings i was provided with much more than masterful film-making this picture has a singular voice that will echo throughout the annuls of film historythe opening montage provides a splendid palette which helmer jp sarro uses to establish his art on this canvas of entertainmentsarro truly uses the camera as his paintbrush while he brings us along on a ride that envelops the audience in a tremendous action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we have become accustomed to and dives deeply into dark themes of betrayal revenge and the importance of companionship this movie is any directors dream at its very corehowever sarro was not alone in this epic undertaking the writing provided by scribe tim sheridan was just as breathtakingthe dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such presence and charisma on the screen specifically speaking the final scene warning: spoilers!!! spoilers!!! where vanessa reveals herself to be one of the coalition and a villain all the time is written in such a dark tone that it is one of the most chilling endings i have ever seen sheridan is the next robert townein a final note it is obvious that this production was no small feattherefore much praise must be given to producer scott shipley who seems to have the creativity and genius to walk next to jerry bruckheimer never before have i witnessed a production so grand with so much attention directed at every little detail a producers job is one of the hardest in any movie and shipley makes it look easyall in all this film combines creative writing stunning production and masterful direction this is the art of film at its best when the ending of the film arrives the only thing that is desired is morethe romeo division is groundbreaking a masterpiece and most importantly the romeo division is indeed art<SEP>1
it looks to me as if the creators of the class of nuke em high wanted it to become a cult film but it ends up as any old high school b-movie only tackier the satire feels totally overshadowed by the extremely steretyped characters its very un-funny even for a turkey<SEP>0
i totally agree that nothing is a fantastic film! ive not laughed so much when watching a film for ages! and david hewlett and andrew miller are fantastic in this! they really work well together! this film may not appeal to some people i cant really say why without spoiling it! but each to their own! i loved it and highly recommend it!the directing is great and some of the shots are very clever it looks as though they may have had a lot of fun when filming it!although there are really only main 2 characters in the film and not an awful lot of props the actors manage to pull it off and make the film enjoyable to watch<SEP>1
this isnt the worst movie ive ever seen but i really cant recall when ive seen a worse one i thought this would be about an aircraft accident investigation what it really was is a soap opera and a bad one at that they overplayed the conflict card to the extreme the first hour or so seems like a shouting match with some implausible scenes thrown in*possible spoiler*the 40-or-so minute memorial scene with requisite black umbrellas and rain to fictitious crash victims was lame and i thought it would never end avoid this one at all costs unless you revel in conflict<SEP>0
beautiful attracts excellent idea but ruined with a bad selection of the actors the main character is a loser and his woman friend and his friend upset viewers apart from the first episode all the other become more boring and boring first it considers it illogical behavior no one normal would not behave the way the main character behaves it all represents a typical halmark way to endear viewers to the reduced amount of intelligence does such a scenario or the casting director and destroy this question is on halmark producers cat is the main character is wonderful the main character behaves according to his friend selfish<SEP>0
complete drivel an unfortunate manifestation of the hypocritical toxic culture of a decade ago in this movie pedestrian regrets for slavery go hand in hand with colonialist subtexts the annoying redhead feeding shaka rice forget historical reality too didnt most western slaves comes from west africa an american slaver easily capturing shaka with a handful of men finally david hasslehoff could not have been any more obnoxious one can only ponder how would he have fared in the miniseries promptly impaled most likely the miniseries was superb and it is unfortunate that dh should have gotten his hands on something unique and made it mundane i tend to think that he had hand in creating this fiasco<SEP>0
okay first of all i got this movie as a christmas present so it was free! first - this movie was meant to be in stereoscopic 3d it is for the most part but whenever the main character is in her car the movie falls flat to 2d! what!!!! its not that hard to film in a car!!! second - the story isnt very good there are a lot of things wrong with itthird - why are they showing all of the deaths in the beginning of the film! it made the movie suck whenever some was going to get killed!!! watch it for a good laugh but dont waste your time buying it just download it or something for cheap<SEP>1
as soon as it hits a screen it destroys all intelligent life forms around ! but on behalf of its producers i must say it doesnt fall into any known movie category it deserves a brand new denomination of its own ! its a neurological drama ! it saddens and depresses every single neuron inside a persons brainits the closest thing one will ever get to a stroke without actually suffering one it drives you speechless all you members go numb your mouth falls open and remains so and the most strange symptom of all is that you get yourself wishing to go blind and deafno small feat for such a sort of a moviethe only word that comes to my mind just having finished my ordeal is outrage !!!!!!<SEP>0
unfortunately for myself - i stumbled onto this show late in its lifetime i only caught a few episodes about three before it was cancelled by abc i loved the characters and storyline - but most of all the great actors! i was a fan of sex and the city so i saw two characters i recognized bridget moynahan was & the character todd was smith jared as well as jay hernandez from carlitos way: rise to power and erika christensen swimfan i enjoy watching young actors get their due and felt like this show would propel their career further along i hope this at least gets put back out on dvd and maybe wb will pick it up for a second season sometime in the meantime im viewing it on abcs website from the beginning<SEP>1
i had never heard of this one before it turned up on cable tv its very typical of late 50s sci-fi: sober depressing and not a little paranoid! despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple the film is pretty much put across in a documentary style - which is perhaps a cheap way of leaving a lot of the exposition to narration and an excuse to insert as much stock footage as is humanly possibly for what is unmistakably an extremely low-budget venture! while not uninteresting in itself the-apocalypse-via-renegade-missile angle later utilized with far greater aplomb for both dr strangelove [1964] and fail-safe [1964] and mercifully short the films single-minded approach to its subject matter results in a good deal of unintentional laughter - particularly in the scenes involving an imminent childbirth and a gang of clueless juvenile delinquents!<SEP>0
this was a hit in the south by southwest sxsw film festival in austin last year and features a fine cast headed up by ers gloria reuben and a scenery-chewing john glover though shot on a small budget in nyc the film looks and sounds fabulous and takes us on a behind the scenes whirl through the rehearsal and mounting of what actors call the scottish play as a reference to the word macbeth is thought to bring on the plays ancient curse the acting company exhibits all the emotions of the play itself lust jealousy rage suspicion and a bit of fun as well the games begin when an accomplished actor is replaced in the lead role by a well-known pretty face from the tv soap opera scene in order to draw bigger crowds the green-eyed monster takes over from there and the drama unfolds nicely fine soundtrack and good performances all around the dvd includes directors commentary and some deleted scenes as well<SEP>1
i gave 1 to this film i cant understand how ettore scolaone of the greater directors of italian cinema made a film like this so stupid and ridiculous! all the stories of the people involved in the movie are unsubstantialboring and not interesting too longtoo boring the only things i save in this movie are giancarlo giannini and vittorio gasmann hope that scola will change radically themes and style in his next film<SEP>0
as a big fan of david mamets films and plays especially his first film house of games that also starred joe mantegna i was expecting great things from this film instead i found myself annoyed by the films superficiality and lack of credibility racial slurs are thrown about without any feeling or meaning behind them in the hopes of setting up a racial tension that for me never materialized identity is totally reevaluated and men become heroes for no apparent reason because of his oaths taken as a cop the lead character adamantly refuses to perform one relatively small action that would harm no one and could possibly save lives and yet performs another action which is very violent and very illegal but then still refuses the minor action in addition a highly unbelievable subplot involving a man who has killed his family is introduced just for the sake of a plot point that was all but advertised with skywriting and the cops reaction to that occurrence stretch credulity way beyond all reasonable limits needless to say after expecting another exciting thriller from david mamet i was extremely disappointed to say the least 3 out of 10<SEP>0
i may not be a critic but here is what i think of this movie well just watched the movie on cinemax and first of all i just have to say how much i hate the storyline i mean come on what does a snowman scare besides little kids secondly it is pretty gory but i bet since the movie is so low budget they probably used ketchup so my critical vote is bomb!!! nice try and the sequel will suck twice as much<SEP>0
there is a uk edition to this show which is rather less extravagant than the us version the person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got the us version of this show is everything that reality tv shouldnt be instead of making a few improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt i do not know if this show is trying to show what a lousy welfare system exists in the us or if you beg hard enough you will receive the rather vulgar product placement that takes place particularly by sears is also uncalled for rsther than turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home build something for the whole community perhaps a place where diy and power tools can be borrowed and returned along with building materials so that everyone can benefit should they want to giving it all to one person can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the local community who still live in the same run down houses<SEP>0
hello mary lou: prom night ii starts at the hamilton high school prom of 1957 where mary lou maloney lisa schrage is cheating on her date bill nordham steve atkinson with bud cooper robert lewis bill finds out & is devastated meanwhile mary lou is announced prom queen 1957 & takes to the stage to accept her award bill still hurting decides to play a practical joke on mary lou so he throws a firecracker on stage but the still lit fuse catches mary lous dress setting it & her on fire within seconds mary lou is toast 30 years later & hamilton high is soon to hold its annual prom night bill micheal ironside is now the principal & has a teenage son named craig justin louis who is dating vicki carpenter wendy lyon & are both planning on going to the prom together bud richard monette is now a priest that terrible night 30 years ago still haunt both bill & bud one day vicki is looking around the schools basement when she discovers a large trunk which she opens this turns out to be a bad move as the vengeful spirit of mary lou is set free & is intent on claiming her crown as prom queen & in her spare time sets out to avenge her untimely death first up is jess browning beth gondek whose death is put down to a suicide mary lou begins to posses vickis body as the night of the prom draws nearer after disposing of some competition in the shape of kelly hennenlotter terri hawkes who tries to fix the prom so she wins mary lou in vickis body is crowned hamilton high prom queen which allows mary lou herself to come back from the dead to make an unexpected appearance & really liven the party upwith absolutely no connection to the original prom night 1980 & directed by bruce pittman i thought hello mary lou: prom night ii wasnt a particularly good film the script by ron oliver concentrates more on supernatural elements rather than cheap teen slasher themes whether this was a good or bad decision will depend on your expectations i suppose personally i found these different elements didnt really gel or work that well together at all the whole film was far to slow to be really enjoyable after the opening sequence where mary lou dies no one else is killed until the half hour mark & then the film plods along for another half an hour until vicki is finally possessed & the film finally picks up momentum for the climax where an evil mary lou kills a whole one person at the prom before she is supposedly defeated come on horror film fans you did expect that clichéd killer not dead & ready for a sequel ending didnt you dont expect a hight body count just five throughout the entire film & none particularly graphic although i did like the way monica beverley hendry as beverly hendry tried to hide in a shower room locker which mary lou crushed & resulting in poor monicas blood oozing out the supernatural side of hello mary lou: prom night ii is depicted by vicki having lots of hallucinations for the first hour & mary lou controlling objects during the latter stages including a couple of creepy shots of a rocking horse which comes to life the blackboard scene is quite good as well as it turns into water & zombie hands drag vicki into it the slasher side of hello mary lou: prom night ii isnt outstanding i did like mary lou herself as she churns out the obligatory one-liners & she made for a good villain even if she didnt get to kill enough people oh & yes i did get the running homages to various other horror film directors with almost all of the characters sharing last names with one this obviously adds nothing to the film but is a nice little touch i suppose the acting is ok but the normally dependable micheal ironside looks lost & uninterested almost as if hes asking himself what hes doing in this & if hell ever work again forget about any gore someone is hanged there is a stabbing with a crucifix that happens off screen someone is impaled with a neon light a computer goes crazy & electrocutes someones face! & mary lou bursts out of vickis body at first as a rotting zombie which was quite a cool scene there are some full frontal nudity shots in the girls shower as well if thats your thing to give it some credit hello mary lou: prom night ii is ok to watch has reasonable production values throughout & is generally well made overall i was disappointed by hello mary lou: prom night ii it was just too slow & ultimately uneventful to maintain my interest for nearly 100 minutes im not sure whether it deserves a 3 or 4 star rating ill give it a 4 as theres nothing specifically wrong with it i suppose & ive sat through much worse films but it just didnt really do anything for me im afraid<SEP>0
a very good story for a film which if done properly would be quite interesting but where the hell is the ending to this filmin fact what is the point of itthe scenes zip through so quick that you felt you were not part of the film emotionally and the feeling of being detached from understanding the storylinethe performances of the cast are questionable if not believabledid i miss the conclusion somewhere in the film i guess we have to wait for the sequel<SEP>0

terrfic film with a slightyly slow start - give it a chance to start cooking story builds in interest and complexity characters and storyline subvert expectation and cliche at all the right moments superb new york city locations - gritty real - are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of sex in the city - in fact the entire film is an antidote to the hbohollywood notion of new york city sex and relationships its a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately loved it! great cast with notable performances by steve buscemi rosario dawson and her love interest forgot his name!<SEP>1
my family has watched arthur bach stumble and stammer since the movie first came out we have most lines memorized i watched it two weeks ago and still get tickled at the simple humor and view-at-life that dudley moore portrays liza minelli did a wonderful job as the side kick - though im not her biggest fan this movie makes me just enjoy watching movies my favorite scene is when arthur is visiting his fiancées house his conversation with the butler and susans father is side-spitting the line from the butler would you care to wait in the library followed by arthurs reply yes i would the bathroom is out of the question is my newmail notification on my computer arthur is truly funny stuff!<SEP>1
director fred schepisiroxanne directs this well intentioned but inferior comedy about albert einsteinmatthau trying to hook his scientific nieceryan up with ordinary guy tim robbins in order to get her to relax and enjoy life in the 1950s to get ryan to like robbins einstein tries to make robbins look like a brilliant scientist the idea is cute but the film falls flat with corny situations and silly dialogue tim robbins meg ryan and the terrific supporting cast do their best to keep this silly comedy afloat but are unable to rescue the film its unfortunate that so much talent went into producing such a lackluster movie i would not recommend to anybody unless they are huge fans of meg ryan<SEP>0
the question when one sees a movie this bad is not necessarily how did a movie this bad get made or even why did i see this awful in the first place but what have i learned from this experience heres what i learned:- just because the rules of horror movies have been catalogued and satirized countless times in the last ten years doesnt mean someone wont go ahead and make a movie that uses all of them without a shred of humor or irony- if your movie has to be described as **loosely** based on the video game you have script problems- the black character may not always die first but the asian character does always know kung-fu- while you may be proud that you figured out how to do the the matrix effect on a budget that doesnt necessarily mean you should use it over and over again ad nausea- being ron howards brother does not guarantee choice roles- whenever a scene doesnt edit together just use some footage from the video game no one will notice- if your cousins rap-metal band offers to write your movies theme for free politely decline- zombie movies are not about people killing zombies theyre about zombies killing people preferably in the most gruesome way possible thats what makes them scary- white people who can pay $1600 to get to a rave deserve to die- if you find an old book it will tell you everything you need to know anything else you will figure out on your own two lines after someone asks what was that or where are we- bare breasts are not horror movie panacea- a helicopter boom shot and a licensing deal with sega magically transforms your movie from student film to major studio release try it!- just because you can name-drop all three living dead movies that does not make you george romero or even paul w s andersonive seen worse movies but only because ive seen mortal kombat: annihilation<SEP>0
i used to watch this on either hbo or showtime or cinemax during the one summer in the mid 90s that my parents subscribed to those channels i came across it several times in various parts and always found it dark bizarre and fascinating i was young then in my early teens; and now years later after having discovered the great arliss howard and being blown away by big bad love i bought the dvd of wilder napalm and re-watched it with my girlfriend for the first time in many years i absolutely loved it! i was really impressed and affected by it there are so many dynamic fluid complexities and cleverness within the camera movements and cinematography; all of which perfectly gel with the intelligent intense and immediate chemistry between the three leads their story the music and all the other actors as well its truly cinematic i love arliss howards subtle intensity ambivalent strength and hidden intelligence im a big fan of anything he does; and his interplay with debra wingers manic glee they are of course married has that magic charming reality to it that goes past the camera i wonder if they watch this on wedding anniversariesbig bad love should be the next stop for anyone who has not seen it; its brilliant and dennis quaid in full clown make-up sneakily introduced angled hidden and displayed by the shot selection and full bloomed delivery is of the kind of pure dark movie magic you dont see very often quaid has always had a sinister quality to him for me anyways with that huge slit mouth span hiding behind his flicker eyes lying in wait to unleash itself as either mischievous charm or diabolical weirdness here as both both howard and quaid have the insane fire behind the eyes to pull off their wonderful intense internal gunslinger square-offs in darkly cool fashion in fact the whole film has a darkly cool energy and hip intensity its really a fantastic film put together by intelligence imagination agility and chemistry by all parties involved i really cannot imagine how this got funded and it looks pretty expensive to me by such a conventional imagination-less system but i thank god films like this slip through the system every once in awhile in a great way with all of its day-glo bright carnival colors hip intelligence darkly warped truthful humor and enthralling chemistry it reminds me of one of my favorite films of all time: grosse pointe blanknow thats a compliment in my book!<SEP>1
a truly dreadful film i did not know initially that this was a kiwi effort - but very soon i started to realize that all the characters were speaking with hardly disguised kiwi accents under the fake american ones why did it need to be set n america anyway - it could have been set in nz and then the actors could have used their normal voices surely someone in the production team could hear the dreadful attempts at speaking with american accents a bad bad film i am surprised it has lasted this long - how did it make it out of the can it just seemed like a very poor attempt at a segalwillis type action man flicka total waste of money! if there was any taxpayer money in this piece of trash i would be leading a revolution to have all the money put back into the treasury i am still reeling get it pun reeling! at the absolute garbage i have just seen why did i continue to watch well i am a movie fanatic and cant help myself!<SEP>0
maybe television will be as brutal one day maybe big brother` was only the first step in the direction stephen richard bachmann` king described the end point of but enough about that if i spend too much words talking about the serious background topic of this movie i do exactly what the producers hoped by choosing this material its the same with the 6th day` no matter how primitive the film is it provokes a discussion about its topic which serves the producers as publicity lets not be taken in by that the social criticism that is suggested by that plot summary is only an alibi to make it possible to produce a speculative violent movie more for video sale than for cinema i didnt read the book i dont dare criticising stephen king without having read him but when i saw the film i thought they couldnt make such a terrible film out of a good book: in a typical 1980s set with 1980s music and some minor actors arnold schwarzenegger finds himself as a policeman running away from killers within a cruel tv show the audience is cheeringtogether with predator` this is definitely schwarzeneggers most stupid movie 2 stars out of 10<SEP>0
every country which has a working film industry has some sane and maybe some insane artist which make movies that you can only completely understand when youre a part of this country i guess hundstage is such a movieyou see the lowest level of austrias society dirty disturbed weird hateful but they still have enough money so they can afford tuned cars and big houses and they are definitely doing a lot of strange things here which maybe seems for them normal because theyre doing it through their whole life from a normal human viewpoint you can now easily follow the movie and be disgusted or fascinated and watch a fine piece of austrias art moviesbut if you live here and you know the people you see the characters in hundstage as the tumor of the society a society that is going more insane from day to day creating their own rules that nobody else can understand cave the social system from within and you see the people sitting in the park standing at the opposite street corner queuing in the same line maybe you meet em in a bar or a disco you may visit maybe you even work with them in your job or they are living next to your house you start to hate them without exactly knowing why youll try to get away - but you cannot maybe youll end up like them but it seems normal for you because youre doing it through your whole life nowlife isnt so bright though austria is one of the richest countries in the world it has beautiful people but some are also ugly there are a lot of hard working persons trying their best but there are also some riding on the back of others and destroying everything that the folk of austria has built up so fara very pessimistic movie<SEP>1

four stories written by robert bloch about various people who live in a beautiful old mansion and what happens to them the first has denholm elliott as a novelist who sees the killer hes writing about come to life some spooky moments and the twist at the end was good the second has peter cushing becoming obsessed with a wax figure resembling his dead wife the third has christopher lee who has a child chloe franks and is scared of her it all leads up to a pretty scary ending although the ending in the story was much worse the last is an out and out comedy with jon petwee and ingrid pitt both chewing the scenery and a cape that turns people into vampires! theres also a cute line about christopher lee playing draculathis is a good horror anthology--nothing terrifying but the first one and the ending of the third gave me a few pleasurable little chills also the fourth one is actually very funny and pitt makes a very sexy vampire! also the house itself looks beautifuland very creepy its well-directed with some nice atmospheric touches a very good and unusual movie score too all in all a good little horror anthology well worth seeking out try to see it on dvd--the lions gate one looks fantastic with strong colors and great sound<SEP>1

ive been looking for the name of this film for years i was 14 when i believe it was aired on tv in 1983 all i can remember was it was about a teenaged girl alone having survived a plane crash and surviving the amazon i remember people were looking for herfamily and that she knew how to take care of herself---she narrates the story and i vividly remember about her knowing that bugs were under her skin i dont remember much else about this movie and want to see it again--if this is the same one--and if any of you have a copy could you email me at horsecoach4hire@hotmailcom id be curious to attain a copy to see if it is in fact the same film i remember it was aired on thanksgivingus in 1983 and i was going through problems of my own and this film really impacted heavily on me thanks in advance!<SEP>1
while i dont claim to be any sort of expert in marine life i must say anyone with a modicum of intelligence could not possibly buy in to this notion of a whale and not even the mother! having a clue about revenge because it witnessed his dead mate having a forced abortion by humans! i mean really! this is basically the whole plot richard harris must have been extremely hard up for roles to have accepted this junk this is the kind of movie that is so bad that if you paid 50 cents to see it you would feel like demanding your money back<SEP>0
i saw the movie last night here at home but i thought it was too long first of all second the things i saw in the movie were way too out of text to even have in this what i thought was going to be a comedy type movie like the rest before the things isnt funny in the movie: fiancé hitting his girlfriend beatings the movie was way too long--talk about wanting to go to sleep and wondering when it will end when you wake up and still have it playing! some of the things at the reunion were too much to capture--like the lady singing--i felt like i was almost watching a spiritual song show here! come on perry you can do better then this!<SEP>0
ive read some terrible things about this film so i was prepared for the worst confusing muddled horribly structured while there may be merit to some of these accusations this film was nowhere near as horrific as your average dvd programmer in fact it actually had aspirations it attempted something beyond the typical monsterslasher nonsense and by god there are some interesting things going onms barbeau is a miracle to behold she carries the film squarely on her shouldersthis is not to say that its a masterpiece unholy ultimately collapses under the weight of its own ambition there are just too many unexplained subplots trying to coexist and the plot loopholes created by time travel are never really addressed: for example if hope knows that her mother is evil and that she will ultimately kill her brother then why doesnt she just kill ma in the films very first sequence seems like it would have beat the hell out of traveling into the future to do itstill i give unholy points for trying a little ambition is not a bad thing<SEP>1
yes i am just going to tell you about this one so dont read if you want surprises i got this one with the title christmas evil there was also another christmas horror on the dvd called silent night bloody night whereas silent night bloody night not to be confused with silent night deadly night had lots of potential and was very close to being good this one wasnt quite as good it started out interesting enough watching the villain if you can call him that watching the neighborhood kids and writing in books about who is naughty and nice but after awhile you are looking for some action and this movie doesnt deliver you need character development but this goes overboard and you are still never sure why the heck the guy snaps about an hour in he kills three of four people while a whole crowd watches in terror and the guys he kills arent even his targets they are just making fun of him this is one of many unsuccessful attempts by the killer to knock of the naughty he then proceeds to try and kill this other guy and he tries to break into his house by squeezing himself into the fireplace he promptly gets stuck and barely manages to get out he then enters through the basement and then tries to kill the guy by smothering him in his bedroom he cant seem to kill the guy this way so he grabs a star off the tree and slits the guys throat what the heck was a tree even doing in the bedroom in the first place oh yeah the killer before this kill stopped off at a party and had some fun too well that is about it except for the town people chasing him with torches and the unresolved part with his brother and that tune he wants to play what was that even about he kept talking about something that was never really explained how does it end you ask well since i have spoilers i will tell you he runs off the road in his van and proceeds to well lets just say it was lame!!!!!!!!!!!!<SEP>0
i cant believe that those praising this movie herein arent thinking of some other film i was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful but the script or lack thereof makes for a film thats also pointless on the plus side the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent but when youve got a sows ear to work with you cant make a silk purse ben g fans should stick with just about any other movie hes been in dorothy s fans should stick to galaxina peter b fans should stick to last picture show and target fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to peter bs amazingly awful book killing of the unicorn<SEP>0
this is where the term classic film comes from this is a wonderful story of a womans bravery courage and extreme loyalty poor olan got sold to her uncaring husband who through the years learned to appreciate her yeah right a pearl!! luise rainer was the beautiful star who had won the best actress oscar the year before for her small role and what a waste of an oscar in the great zigfield it really didnt show what if any talent she had other than her exotic beauty but in good earth she shows that she can really act! her beauty was erased and she had no great costumes either people say that she didnt show any real emotions in this film like hell her character olan is a shy and timid woman with inner strength she is quiet during parts of the film with only her eyes and body to convey her emotions example: those scenes during the fall of the city and when looters were being shot if you people are saying that she doesnt act well in this film you are not looking!paul muni shows that he can act as well his character is not a likeable one to me he never sees her for what she is until the very end of the story a sweet loving and dedicated wife and mother with her own special beauty the greatest one of all the beauty from within like a pearlif you get a chance to see this film watch it you will see one of the best films that the golden age of hollywood created<SEP>1
this is an awful film yea the girls are pretty but its not very good the plot having a cowboy get involved with an indian maiden would be interesting if the sex didnt get in the way well okay it might be interesting but its not because its so badly paced and and only partly acted i can only imagine what the close ups of the dancing tushes looked like on a big screen probably more laughable then they do on tv i wont even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing chest to chest never read about that in the old west this is a film that requires liberal use of fast forwardi like schlock films but this is ridiculous there is a reason that i dont go for this sort of films and that they tend not be very good the plot taking a back seat to breasts the original nudie cuties as they are called were originally nudist films or films where there was no touching but as the adult industry began to grow the film makers either tried to be clever or tried to exploit something else in order to put butts in seats the clever ones were very few which only left hacks who were of limited talent the comedies often came off best with the humor approaching the first grade level infantile but harmlessly fun something that could rarely be said about any other genre cross dressed as a nudiethe ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces but its done in by being neither western nor sex filmi need not watch this againof interest to probably no one the rapist and killer in the film was played by bobby beausoleil a member of the manson family who was arrested for murdering a school teacher not long after filming wrappedobviously these sort of things will ruin some peoples lives<SEP>0
zombie review #3**spoilers**few films are actually so bad theyre good and zombi 3 is not just bad its wretchedly unforgivably bad in so many ways that a whole new language may be needed just to describe them allmore than that its a film credited to lucio fulci that even by his standards has absolutely no coherency sense or reason however we cant blame fulci as it wasnt really directed by him but by bruno mattei who doesnt even have fulcis sense of style to help carry the film mattei seems to have brought little to the film but staggering ineptitudeso im ashamed to say how much i enjoyed every worthless minute of zombi 3 it has no redeeming features - in a genre known for thin characters weak story and lack of film making skill zombi 3 pushes the boat out but in doing so its even funnier than nightmare citythe action starts when the death 1 gas is stolen from a military base and damaged in the escape who is the thief why did he steal it and why did the us military think that creating cannibalistic legions of the living dead would be a good idea all these questions and more will fail to be answered in zombi 3after hiding out at a hotel the infected thief goes mad from all the green plastecine growing on his face before being tracked down by the army who somewhat foolishly decide the best way to dispose of his corpse will be to burn it sending death 1 up into the atmosphere resulting in zombie birds! who then attack people and turn them into zombie people!!! if zombies are cannibals why dont the zombie birds just attack other birdsthen we meet our heroes a trio of horny gis and a coachload of girls theres a couple of other guys with them too but theyre not important - no one is important here youll be hard pressed to remember anyones face let alone their name or find a reason to care about them they end up hiding out at the same hotel as the thief a week ago this place was buzzing with life now its buzzing with flies! but theres no escape from the undeadby this point youll either be completely sucked in or youll have turned the damned thing off the script is so appalling even the greatest acting in the world couldnt save it so its just as well they have some of the worst - and not just the human characters the zombie acting here is an all time low theres no consistancy in how the zombies behave - some shamble about in the time honored style others engage in full on fist fights or charge around with machettes not to mention the zombies who are still able to talk a gimmick that gives the film its horrifying twist ending they die from gunshots to the chest rather than the head and even get knocked out by a good left-hook how can you punch out a zombie!!!!! in fact the emphasis on badly done 80s action often makes it resemble an episode of vthe zombies also spend a lot of time hiding seemingly waiting for hours in ridiculous places on the chance some poor sap will pass by and get the fright of their life they hide in bushes in garages in huts on roofs in the water and even underneath pregnant women at one point a zombie follows a woman up the stairs to kill and eat her no! to push her into the water those zombies and their wacky sense of humour!there is plenty of gore though limbs are hacked wounds ooze green pus and theres much in the way of flesh eating and people getting their faces mushed in theres nothing to match the originals eyeball piercing but if bad make up effects are your bag you wont be let downall this and ive not even mentioned the awful music the inexplicable flying zombie head the scientist whose acting actually manages to stand out as really bad or the final chilling punchline in an ingenious twist on the originals radio station being overrun by zombies zombi 3 gives us an actual zombie dj!! hes gone over to their side! our escaping heros cry before vowing to continue fighting against the undead in a sequel that sadly never camezombi 3 is rubbish - it would be no loss to the world if every single print was destroyed and all records of its existence erased yet somehow i feel my life is richer for having seen itdid i say richer i meant 88 minutes shorter<SEP>0
seven pounds: emotionally flat illogical morally disturbingthe movie was distributed in italy as seven souls i was curious about the original title and after some research i found out that it refers to shakespeares merchant of venice where the usurer shylock makes a terrible bond with the merchant antonio who will have to give him a pound of his flesh in case he is not able to repay his debt whereas the italian translation makes bens plan something deeply human characterized by human sympathy the original one though cultivated enough to remain unperceived by anyone makes it just in its reference to the flesh something cold rational deep-rooted in the physical side of man unfortunately i think that the real quality of bens plan is revealed by the original title: ita a cold machination aimed at donating parts of his body but lacking any authentic human empathy at least the audience is not given the chance to see or perceive any pure relation of souls within the whole movie the only exception is the love-story with the girl which seems to be a sort of non-programmed incident to which ben yields but incapable of conveying true emotional involvement i really didnt like the idea at the core of the movie: the idea that a person however devoured by the pain for the death of his beloved and of other people he himself has caused takes the resolute decision to expiate his sense of guilt through suicide: besides being improbable it makes no sense i would have liked and i think it would have been more positive if in the end ben had decided to abandon the idea of committing suicide and go on living thus helping those same people and maybe many more just standing near them and helping them through his presence he wouldnt have saved their lives miraculously of course: this would have probably caused more suffering but i think it could have been more constructive from a human and moral point of view there are many illogical and disturbing things: the initial reference to gods creation in seven days which by the way according to the bible are six!: what does it mean and what about a woman suffering from heart-disease which prevents her from running and even from singing without feeling bad who can have normal sex with a man who feeling as it should be destroyed by the death of his wife and having donated organs and pieces of his body doesnt seem to feel so much tried both emotionally and physically from his impaired condition the movie is saved by good acting but all the rest is pure nonsense not only from a logical point of view but also from a human and emotional one<SEP>0
this is one of those films that explore the culture clash of eastern born people in westernized cultures loving on tokyo time is a sad film about the inability of opposites to attract due to major cultural differences ken rock nroll fanatic marries kyoto a japanese girl so that she can stay in the united states when her visa expires the marriage is only expected to be temporary that is until kyoto gains legal status again but ken who seems to be lost in every relationship takes a liking to kyoto and tries very hard to make things work out this despite his friends urging that dumping kyoto and getting rid of all commitments to girls is bad for rock n roll except to inspire some song writing about broken hearts and all of thatbut kyoto comes from a strict traditional japanese upbringing and doesnt expect to be married to ken all that long not only that she is homesick and wants to return to japan its sad in that this is finally someone ken thinks he can love and be with and all that except the one time he thinks hes found someone to feel that way about the girl isnt expecting to stay that long its not that she doesnt like ken its just that shes used to a whole nother way of life she says i cant tell him the way i feel in english and ken cant tell me the way he feels in japanese its a rather sad love story with a killer 80s techno-nintendo soundtracki picked up loving on tokyo time because it reminded me of one of my favorite 80s films tokyo pop and for those of you who enjoyed loving on tokyo time check out tokyo pop a new york singer goes to japan and joins a japanese american cover band except its a movie with a happy ending<SEP>1
i usually dont comment anything i read the others opinions but this this one i _have_ to comment i was convinced do watch this movie by worlds like action f-117 and other hi-tech stuff but by only few first minutes and i changed my mind lousy acting lousy script and a big science fictionits one of the worst movies i have ever seensimply dont botherand one more thing before any movie i usually check user comments and rating on this site 37 points and i give this movie a try now im wondering who rate this movie by giving it more than 2 points<SEP>0
this night listener is better than people are generally saying it has weaknesses and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis no doubt but i think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this the whole thing feels like one of those fireside this happened to a friend of a friend of mine ghost stories one big complaint about the movie is the pacing: but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility and real life just sort of plods alongno so there are no flashy endings or earth-shattering revelations no showdown scenes thank heaven you have to get into the zone when watching this movie forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a conventionallygood movie williams isnt terrific but he easily meets the needs of the story plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic no one as he is the everyman the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story toni collettes performance should be nominated for an oscar even if she maybe shouldnt win it give it a shot for quality and content alone the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days<SEP>1
reese witherspoon first outing on the big screen was a memorable one she appears like a fresh scrubbed face tween slight and stringy but undeniably reesei have always liked her as an actor and had no idea she started this young with her career go figure i actually gained some respect for reese to know who she was so early on i say that because whenever i have watched her perform the characters thus far in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character quite nicely in factanyway my first film experience with reese was the little red riding hood parody reese did with kiefer sutherland somehow i assumed that was her first time up at bat not so well done reese<SEP>1
really the use of stock nature documentary of swarming bats employed by the bat people is some of the most effective ever there are shots of teeming bats hanging from the ceilings of caves swarming bats flying out of caves or swirling about near the mouths of caves that alone is enough to be unsettling: imagine all of them swarming after you and they do indeed swarm in what should have been a show-stopper sequence that happened at about the forty minute mark a downright inappropriately hilarious sequence where a teeming swarm of bats seem to attack a police car splattering across the windshield like bloody broken eggs the problem is that this sequence happens about fifty minutes too late to save the film most of which consists of one or more people running around screaming waving their arms about at jabbering excitedly about some poor goofball who managed to get bitten by a bat during his vacationthe fear is that he is coming down with rabies which does indeed suck so their vacation is ruined as the plot synopsis on the top of the bat peoples reference page does indeed point out so here is an effective summary of the movie: a young couple goes on a romantic getaway which is ruined when the guy is bitten by a bat they bravely try to stick it out but he starts raving trying to convince those around him that its a bit more involved than rabies that he cant control himself and they everyone should keep awaynow when some one is frothing at the mouth covered with sweat eyes boggling about like one of the cheaper muppets and screaming at you to get away from me you get away from him you dont try to give him drugs you dont try to tell him you love him you give the guy his space go home and try that scenic getaway next yearbut no the people in this movie all behave like morons insist on pushing the guy to his brink and he flips out mutates into a part man part bat type creature and kills a bunch of non-essential secondary characters nothing wrong with that but the movie forgets that its a low budget creature feature and tries to be some sort of psychological study instead of a monster movie we get lots of people running around trying to get this guy to take a chill pill and eventually he runs off into the hills looking very much more human than he should have people insist on trying to chase him down and pay the expected pricethe main thing wrong with the movie is that this should have happened in the first fifteen or twenty minutes thirty tops and the movie should have been about the guy after he had turned into a bat person rather than about the journey there it takes a good eighty minutes to really pick up steam on that front with some interesting character sketches along the way involving the always entertaining michael pataki as a small town cop whos lost his moral edge and the late paul carr as a physician friend who doesnt quite get the messagethe movie is dreadfully boring about fifteen minutes too long and missed the opportunity to be a nice forgettable little creature feature about a mutant run amok like the italian horror favorite ratman which i watched today and was sadly inspired to try this one after seeing me and my bright ideas though the scene with the cop car was a howler: too bad we couldnt have had another twenty minutes of that310<SEP>0
cuban blood is one of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way i actually watched it while sailing around cuba on a western caribbean cruise it details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end when the socialist regime came and took the property of the boys father the majority of the film is the boys coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else there are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to a class a film with fine acting and directing this is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or real twists it is a film about people and their lives their mistakes and their triumphs a good film worth watching several times annually<SEP>1
im surprised at the comments from posters stating that jane powell made the same type of films deanna durbin did although they were both young sopranos whose film images were crafted by joe pasternak if this film is any indication they were almost polar oppositeswhile in three smart girls durbin plays an impulsive little miss fixit who after some setbacks manages to reunite her divorced parents in its semi-remake three daring daughters jane powell almost destroys the marriage between her screen mom jeanette macdonald and new stepfather jose iturbi when she refuses to accept him and strong arms her younger siblings into rejecting him too from the durbin and powell films ive seen id say these disparate qualities permeate the early films of both of these talented young performersas for durbins performance in three smart girls i find it completely winning and most impressive although its clear from her occasionally shrill and over-emphatic line readings in some of the more energetic scenes that this is an early film for deanna watching the self-confident knowing and naturally effervescent manner in which she delivers her lines and performs overall and the subdued and tender manner she projects the more serious scenes youd never guess that this was the first film role of a 14 year-old girl whose prior professional experience consisted almost exclusively of two years of vocal instruction given that this film and durbin herself were much publicized at the time as universals last chance the production must have been an impossibly stressful situation for a film novice of any age but youd never know it from the ease and assurance durbin displays on screen although shes clearly still developing her acting style and demeanor before the camera this was equally true of the early performances of much more experienced contemporaries like garland rooney oconnor and jane powell durbin projects an extraordinary presence and warmth on camera that is absolutely unique to her and even here in her first film she manages to remain immensely likable despite the often quick-tempered impulsiveness of her character and though shes occasionally shrill she never for a second projects the coy and arch qualities that afflicted many child stars including jane powell and some of the other young sopranos who followed in the wake of her successin short like all great singing stars durbin was much more than just a beautiful voice on the other hand while durbins pure lyric soprano is a truly remarkable and glorious instrument the most remarkable thing about it to me was the way she is able to project her songs without the slightest bit of affectation or grandnes that afflict the singing of adult opera singers like lily pons grace moore and jeanette macdonald in films of the periodthe film is also delightful heavily influenced by screwball comedy it backs durbin up with a creme-de-la-creme of first-class screwball pros such as charles winninger binnie barnes alice brady ray milland and mischa auer the story is light and entertaining true its hardly realistic but why would anyone expect it to be if you want :realistic rent the grapes of wrath or triumph of the will on the other hand if youre looking for a genuine sweet funny and entertaining family comedy with a wonderfully charismatic and gifted adolescent lead and terrific supporting players this film wont let you down<SEP>1
i think the deal with this movie is that it has about 2 minutes of really really funny moments and it makes a very good trailer and a lot of people came in with expectations from the trailer and this time the movie doesnt live up to the trailer its a little more sluggish and drags a little slowly for such an exciting premise and i think im seeing from the comments people having a lovehate relationship with this moviehowever if you look at this movie for what it is and not what it could have been considering the talent of the cast i think its still pretty good julia stiles is clearly the star shes so giddy and carefree that set among the conformity of everyone else she just glows and the whole audience falls in love with her along with lee the rest of the cast of course lees testosterone-filled coworkers his elegant mother-in-law his fratlike friend jim and his bride-to-be all do an excellent job of fitting into stereotypes of conformity and boringness that make stiles stand out in the first place lee doesnt live up to his costars i dont think but you could view that as more that theyre hard to live up to maybe thats one source of disappointmentthe movie itself despite a bit of slowness and a few jokes that dont come off as funny as the writers intended is still pretty funny and i found a rather intelligent film the themes of conformity and taking the safe route seemed to cleverly align on several layers for example there was the whole motif of how he would imagine scenarios but would never act on them until the last scene or how he was listening to a radio program on the highway talking about how everyone conforms or just how everything selma blair and julia stiles characters said and did was echoed by those themes of one person being the safe choice and one being the risky choicethe other good thing about the movie was that it was kind of a screwball comedy in which jason lee has to keep lying his way through the movie and who through dumb luck example: the pharmacy guy turning out to be a good chef and some cleverness on his part gets away with it for the most partwhile it wasnt as funny as i expected and there was a little bit of squandered talent but overall its still a good movie<SEP>1
this is without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen it is not funny it is not interesting and should not have been made<SEP>0
everybodys got bills to pay and that includes christopher walkenin vietnam a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of pows including christopher walken following a mad max 3 ! thunderdome fight and a short massacre later walken and some colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or othercut to the present 1991 and colombian guy is leading a revolution against el presidente hes successful at first but after el presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank hes forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television this is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on american telly which leads walken to assemble the old squad even though he wasnt actually part of that squad to begin with in order to invade colombia and gun down thousands of peoplemcbain is a monumentally stupid film but for all that its also a good laugh and action packed too this is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression or even breaking a window also it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in new york without the police botheringtheres plenty of b-movie madness to chew on here from michael ironsides diabolical acting in the vietnam sequence to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes to the side splitting confrontation between walken and el presidente and lets not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader being watched on television in america nearly brought a brown tear to my nether-eye that bitits out there for a quid buy it if you have a sense of humour see how many times you can spot the camera crew too<SEP>1
i grew up on scooby doo where are you and i still love it it is one of my favourite cartoons along with darkwing duck talespin peter pan and the pirates and tom and jerry this show though is good for kids the voices are gooddon messick and casey kasem are perfect as scooby and shaggy the theme tune is tolerable and it has some nice animation however it is rather disappointing i normally dont mind scrappy but when he appears to be like the main character it gets annoying fast complete with the catchphrase puppy power scrappy is somewhat more annoying than usual also half the gang are missing after the first year somehow it didnt feel like scooby doo and the jokes and the story lines were in general lame and unoriginal very little chasing monsters or unmasking the baddies all in all not as bad as shaggy and scooby doo:get a clue but this show is disappointing 410 for the animation voices theme tune and the fact it is nice for kids bethany cox<SEP>0
lets cut to the chase: if youre a baby-boomer you inevitably spent some time wondering at the fact that in 1976 mccartney had the gumption to drop in on johns city hermit life and spend the day with him you also certainly wondered how things went i heard the exact same reports that the writer of this film heard from johns and pauls perspective and i admit that i reconstructed the meeting in pretty much the same way this film does but none of my imaginings could have bought tears to my eyes the way this incredible piece of work and acting does i found it amazingly lifelike perfectly plausible and 100 % saccharin-free now can anyone explain why i didnt hear of this masterpiece before it was shown by the cbc last night i mean its already three years old for goodness sake! and yes if youre a beatles fan this is a must-see performance! even the subtle paraphrasing of beatles melodies in the background is inspired<SEP>1

one of the most disgusting films i have ever seen i wanted to vomit after watching it i saw this movie in my american history class and the purpose was to see an incite on the life of a farmer in the west during the late 1800s what we saw were pigs being shot and then slaughtered human birth branding oh and at the end there was a live birth of a calf and let me tell you that the birth itself wasnt too bad but the numerous fluids that came out drove most people in my class to the bathroom the story itself was ok the premise of the story is a widow and her daughter and they move to the west to be a house keeper of this cowboy they live a life of hardship and it is an interesting a pretty accurate view of life in the west during the late 1800s but if you have a choice do not see this movie<SEP>0
the statistics in this movie were well researched there is no doubt about it! al gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no wonder that this movie got the praise that it got al gore is certainly quite an actor he sounds so concerned but actions speak louder than words! throughout this movie there are political tidbits and references to his political career sprinkled throughout the moviejimmy carter unlike al gore is a man of integrity who not only talks the talk but walks the walk as well when carter thought we needed to conserve energy he turned down the thermostat in the white house and got warm by wearing a sweateral gore tells us that we have to conserve energy and claims that we are creating global warming while he travels around in his own private jet how much energy does his jet use and how much more pollution does his jet create how much energy does it take to heat gores swimming pool behind his mansion it would be nice if we could conserve electricity by using smaller appliances and making it a point to turn off anything that is not being used but if we did the power company would react to a 50% reduction of energy by calling it a 50% loss in revenue and recouping their losses by raising the rates by 50% so just turning it off would not be a very good ideathis movie is a veiled appeal to allow big goivernment to take control of everything in the name of saving planet earth that is<SEP>0
you know you are in trouble watching a comedy when the only amusing parts in it are from the animal cast it is a pity then that the parrot cat & dog were only in support & not the other way around as the humans in it were pretty abysmal throughoutif i were you paul eva lake what sort of name is that jason & lindsay i would forget this acting lark & do something else as all of you are as funny as watching paint dry & awful actors to bootthe main gag in the film is one of the characters shouting me not gay which is funny as if you werent you might change your mind if you had to put up with the three bossy tedious & dare i say very plain women leads in the filmthe worst film i have seen in years & hopefully never see one as bad again though i expect not<SEP>0
a tour deforce! ok the kid that plays oliver is a bit toooooo sweet! starting with the great cinematography color costumes and most impressive performances this is a must see movie i have seen several adaptations of this great novel but this one stands above them all and its a musical to boot! it is a masterful fagan never leaving his character to do a song you never really know if you like him or not the same feeling i got in the book in other versions you hate him from start to finish bill sykes when you read the book hes a mean one and so he is in this movie oliver reed was masterful his wife directed this masterpiece i went and saw his last movie gladiator based on his many fine performances not to see the headliners the music fits the times and the mood who will buy this beautiful movie you should!<SEP>1
due to budget cuts ethel janowski again played by priscilla alden is released from a mental institution even though she killed six people and delivered to the hope bartholomew halfway house once there she immediately relapses into her criminally insane ways and kills anyone who gets between her and her foodholy moly! does this movie suck! you know you are in trouble when the open credits start up and they are just the credits from the first film apparently filmed off a tv screen nick millard under his pseudonym nick phillips decided to return to the world of crazy fat ethel over ten years later and with a budget that probably covered the cost of a blank tape and a video camera rental for the weekend lets just say that millards unique style doesnt translate well to video seriously i have made home movies with more production value than this and millard tries to pull a silent night deadly night 2 by padding half the running time with footage from the first film which looks like it was taken off a worn vhs copy alden is again good as ethel but the film is so inept that you start to feel sorry for her for starring in this garbage i mean at least the first film tried here we have no music weaker effects if that is at all possible shaky camera work horrible audio and editing that looks like it was done with two vcrs hooked up avoid this at all costs!<SEP>0
sadly more downs than ups the plot was pretty decent i mean nothing out of the ordinary but it had a story unlike the other modern horror flicks the other good thing was the cast im not saying that the acting was good because it wasnt but every actoractress was hot and attractiveone of the downs are that the movie only become exciting after the first 40 minutes or so the rest was quite boring another down or you could consider it an up if you want is the excessive nudity all 4 girls were topless for a few minutes and all the guys showed their butts for a long time its not that im against nudity but this was a horror movie not the dreamersunless youre very desperate to watch some guy take off his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes or watch a girl get naked for no reason or youre a die-hard fan of debbie rochon than this is the movie for you but if youre looking for a good horror movie stay away<SEP>0
as a casual listener of the rolling stones i thought this might be interesting not so as this film is very of its age in the 1960s to me someone born in the 1980s this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap but i am sure this film was not made for me but people who were active during th 60s i expected drugs galore with th stones i was disappointed it actually showed real life hard work in the studio so much so i felt as if i was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film i have not seen any of the directors other films but i suspect they follow a similar style of directing sort of amatuerish which gave a feeling like the tv show eurotrash badly directed tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value my only good opinion of this is that i didnt waste money on it it came free with a sunday paper<SEP>0
a real disappointment from the great visual master ridley scott gi jane tells the story of a first female ever to go through the hellish training at the navy seals the training is the most difficult and hard in existence as the instructor says in the film to the lead character oneil played by demi moore there is no particular message or point in this film or then i couldnt reach it properly it may be a some kind of a statement of female rights and abilities but it all sinks under the tired scenes and stupid gun fight at the end of the filmi really cant understand why ridley uses so much zooms in that mentioned last gun battle at the desert! it looks sooooo stupid and irritating and almost amateurish so i would really like to know what the director saw in that technique when i look at his latest film black hawk dawn there is absolutely nothing wrong in the battle scenes which are plenty and they are very intense and directed with skill the whole finale in gi jane looks ugly and is nothing more but stupid and brainless shooting and killingthis is ridley scotts worst movie in my opinion and there are no significant touches from which this great director is known still im glad i saw this in widescreen format because there are still couple of great scenes and samples of scotts abilities but they are very few in this filma disappointment and nothing compared to the classics blade runner thelma & louise alien and so on of this talented director so im forced to give gi jane 410<SEP>0
a remarkable documentary about the landmark achievements of the women lawyers association wla of kumba in southwest cameroon in legally safeguarding the rights of women and children from acts of domestic violence in this muslim culture where men have always been sovereign over women according to sharia law one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children after 17 years of failed efforts leaders of the wla began recently to score a few wins and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious storiesthe leaders of this legal reform movement are vera ngassa a state prosecutor and beatrice ntuba a senior judge court president both play themselves in this film which may contain footage shot spontaneously though i imagine much of it if not all consists of subsequent recreations of real events for the camera four cases are reviewed and all of the plaintiffs also play themselves in the filmtwo cases involve repeated wife beating with forcible sex in one case; another involves forced sex upon a 10 year old girl; and yet another concerns the repeated beatings of a child age 8 by an aunt one of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce we follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the outcomes of the trials the outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children the perpetrators receive stiff prison terms andor fines; the divorce is grantedthe aggressive prosecution of the child beating aunt demonstrates that these female criminal justice officials are indeed gender-neutral when it comes to enforcing the law also noteworthy is the respect with which all parties including those found guilty are treated this is a highly important and well made film of interest is the fact that one of the directors ms longinotto also co-directed the 1998 film divorce iranian style which dealt with related themes in tehran in broken english with english subtitles my grade: b+ 810<SEP>1
this is probably one of the worst french movies i have seen so far among more than 100 french movies i have ever seen terrible screenplay and very medioacreunprofessional acting causes the directing powerless with all that it doesnt matter how nice western french scene and fancy music can add to the storyone of the key weakness of this movie is that these two characters do not attract people as an audience i dont care what happens to them it amazed me how this movie won jury prize in cannes man i love almost all the awarded movies in cannes but not this one a major disappointment for me<SEP>0
i saw this movie on cable it was really funny from the stereotype police chief to the stereotype big bad guys jay leno and mr mayagi from karate kid star in this good comedy about a prototype car part i compare this movie to rush hour in which a local cop has to partner up with an asian police officer to solve a case the chase through farmers market in downtown detroit brings back memories enjoyable soundtrack good script i give it 1010<SEP>1
i saw the last five or ten minutes of this film back in 1998 or 1999 one night when i was channel-surfing before going to bed and really liked what i saw since then ive been on the lookout scouring tv listings flipping through dvdvhs racks at stores but didnt find a copy until recently when i found out some internet stores sold it then being a world-class procrastinator i still didnt order it finally i found a dvd copy in a circuit city while visiting portland or a few weeks ago then it only took me about a month after returning home before sitting down and watching itso what do i think about the film its good not as good as i remembered and hoped for but still well worth the $999 it cost me after seeing the whole film for the first time i rate it as a 710 with potential to become an 810 ill have to be less sleepy then and have a better sound system to avoid rewinding to catch some dialogue<SEP>1
one stinko of a movie featuring a shopworn plot and to be kind acting of less than oscar caliber but to me the single worst flaw was the total misrepresentation of a jet aircraft and especially a 747 some of the major blunders:1 no flight engineer or even a flight engineer station 2 mis-identifying the f-16 interceptors as f-15s no resmblance whatsoever 3 loading passengers into an aft baggage compartment supposedly accesible from the cabin - even if such a compartment existed placing that much weight that far aft would make the aircraft unflyable 4 hollow point bullets that wont damage the aircraft 5 the entire landing procedure was so bad i wanted to puke 6 an sr-71 of all planes with a pressure seal hatch 7 opening a cabin door outward - into the wind - in flight!!ah nuts it was just a truly lousy movie gotta make the list of bottom 10 of the year<SEP>0
things to come is that rarity of rarities a film about ideas many films present a vision of the future but few attempt to show us how that future came about the first part of the film when war comes to everytown is short but powerful ironically film audiences in its release year laughed at reports that enemy planes were attacking england--appeasement was at its height wells prediction was borne out all too soon the montage of endless war that follows while marred by sub-par model work is most effective the explanatory titles are strongly reminiscent of german expressionist graphic design the art director was the great william cameron menzies and his sets of the ruins of everytown are among his best work margaretta scott is very seductive as the chiefs mistress the everytown of the 21st century is an equally striking design the acting in the 21st century story is not compelling--perhaps this was a misfired attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of this time with the barbarism of 1970 unfortunately the model work representing angry crowds rushing down elevated walkways is laughably bad and could have been done much better even with 30s technology this is particularly galling since the scenes of the giant aircraft are very convincing this is redeemed by raymond masseys magnificent speech that concludes the film--rarely has the ideal of scientific progress been expressed so well masseys final question is more relevant now than ever in an era of severely curtailed manned spaceflight the scene is aided by the stirring music of sir arthur bliss whose last name i proudly shareunfortunately the vhs versions of this film are absolutely horrible with serious technical problems most versions have edited out a rather interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines that takes us from 1970 to 2038 i hope a good dvd exists of the entire film<SEP>1
i just saw this episode this evening on a recently-added presentation by one of our local independent channels which now presents two episodes each weekdayas the gentleman opined in the other previous comment here i agree this may not have been one of the best programs of the series but i find it entertaining nonethelessmy father was a friend of one of the principals in my hometown cincinnati for whom young rod serling had worked in the media there -- and i remember dad telling how talented and creative he was remembered there overall twilight zone is certainly one of the true classics in television and given its production during the height of the cold war period provides not only a view of this era in the country but also today a nostalgic picture of production techniques creative viewpoints and the actors of this era several decades ago* minor spoiler*this particular story depicts as did other presentations in this series and elsewhere a story where the locale is meant to provide a surprise ending sometimes the characters are on earth from elsewhere while the story at first implies at least one is an earthling these usually contained the message as here of a situation prompted by the doomsday buttons having finally been pressed by the super powers during this cold war periodviewed today stories like this one provide a nostalgic look at this worldly viewpoint 4-5 decades ago and still provide some food-for-thought -- as did this episodewhile the dialog may not have stretched the considerable talents of the leads it still presents a simple important message and a worthwhile 20-some minutes of entertainment and interest<SEP>1
i dont usually comment but there are things that need to be said where to startthe acting on jeremy londons part was horrible! i didnt think he could be so bad the plot could have been good had it been well directed along with a good solid performance from the lead actor unfortunately this is one of those movies you read about and think it has great potential to be entertaining but get disappointed from the start well at least i got good laughs i wouldnt waste my time if i were you<SEP>0
this is not bela lagosis best movie but its got a good old style approach for some 40s horror entertainmentbrides are dropping dead at the altar like flies i think id postpone the wedding until after the fiend is caught but its a horror movie so i guess people ignore the danger for some reason anyway lagosi is a mad doctor who needs young female blood to keep his aging sickly wife healthy and happy he always eludes the keystone cops by hiding the bodies in a hearse who would think of looking for a corpse in a hearse and the brides just keep on getting zappedno movie like this would be complete without a lois lane type female reporter who wants to catch the criminal on her own good at solving crime bad at keeping her mouth shut at all the wrong times guess who lagosi picks for his next intended victim i love the haunted house bit where lois lane gets stranded by a thunderstorm as a guest at lagosis sinister mansion hidden passageways a vampire-like wife an evil dwarf igor assistant and so on good stufffairly well done pacing keeps the film moving and the story resolves itself in a typical but satisfying manner if you like old horror movies this one is worth a watch<SEP>1
aim for the top! gunbuster is one of those anime series which has classic written all over it i totally loved this series and to this day it remains my favorite anime and while it was not gainaxs first animated product it was their first ova seriesmainly starting out as a parody of the 1970s sports drama aim for the ace ace o nerae! gunbuster picks up steam as a serious drama toward the ending of episode 2 when noriko takaya is forced to relive the death of her father who was killed in mankinds initial encounter with the insect race humanity is at war with it is because of her fathers death that noriko wants to become a combat pilot but her lack of confidence proves to get in the way at times and she falters her friend kazumi amano even has doubts about noriko being chosen as a pilot however norikos coach koichiro ota has faith in her and he has made it his personal mission to see that she succeeds at becoming a pilot for he was a survivor of the battle in which norikos father was killedother characters include jung-freud a russian combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron noriko and kazumi belong to smith toren a love interest for noriko who is killed in their first sortie together and kimiko higuchi norikos childhood friend kimikos involvement is also of interest as while noriko is off in space kimiko remains behind on earth to live a normal life and because of the acts of time dilation kimiko ages normally on earth while noriko is relatively the same age as when she left school by the end of the series noriko is roughly 18 years old while kimiko is in her mid-fiftiesall in all this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of giant robot mecha and of gainax animation if you like hideaki annos other shows or are a fan of haruhiko mikimotos artwork then give this show a chance it will grow on you<SEP>1
the british public school system did not evolve solely with the idea of educating the upper classes despite that popular and widespread misconceptionit was designed to produce administrators and governorscivil servants and military men to run the british coloniesthese people were almost entirely recruited from the middle classeswhen the public schools had begun to show their worth the scions of the aristocracy were sent to them rather than be educated at home by tutors and governesses as had previously been the casethey tended to favour the schools nearer town so eton and harrow became particularly popular with that class of parent the vast majority of public schools took their pupils from lower down the social scaletom brownperhaps the most famous public school pupil everwas the son of a country parsonnot a belted earl thus in late 1960s englanda country in the throes of post-colonial guilt and shedding the last of its commitments to its former dependants as quickly as harold wilson could slip off his gannex maclindsay andersons if was greeted with cathartic joy by the chattering classes and mild bemusement by everyone else it must be remembered that the so-called summer of love was followed by the october revolution a non-event that left a few policemen in london with bruised heads and the us embassy with one or two broken windowsbut achieved absolutely nothing so when mr andersons film reached the cinemas the disgruntled former revolutionaries revelled vicariously in what they saw as mr malcolm mcdowells glorious victory over an amorphous them despite the fact that he was ruthlessly gunned down at the enda fate that would have undoubtedly overtaken them had they succeeded in their attempts to get into the usembassy the film told us nothing new about public schoolshomosexualitybullying cold showerspatrician sarcastic teacherssilly traditionsan all-too familiar list it was declared to be an allegory comparing britain to the corruptcrumbling society represented by the schoolwellnearly forty years on the same schools are still flourishingthe british social system has not changedthe october revolution has been long forgotten except by those involved on one side or the other and mr anderson has completed his state of the country trilogy to no effect whatsoever if by any chance you should wish to read a book about schoolboys who did buck the system rather more successfully than mr mcdowell and his friends and furthermore lived to tell the talefind a copy of stalky & cowritten by the man whose much-maligned poem if lent its name to mr andersons filma man born in colonial indiaa man whose work is quietly being airbrushed out of our literary historyand do it before the chattering classes succeed in declaring him a non-personperhaps somebody should start a revolution about that<SEP>0
a typical goth chick rainbow harvest looking like a cross between winona ryder in beetlejuice and boy george gets even with people she feels have wronged her with the help of an old haunted mirror that she finds in the new house she and her mom horror mainstay karen black the only remotely good thing about this travesty buy the actings pretty laughably bad especially when rainbow interacts with the aforementioned mirror and there are no scares or suspense to be had this film inexplicably spawned thus for 3 sequels each slightly more atrocious than the last people looking for a similarly themed but far superior cinematic endeavor would be well advised to just search out the episode of friday the 13th: the series where a geeky girl finds an old cursed compact mirror that packs more chills in its scant 40 minutes than this whole franchise has provided across its 4 filmsmy grade: d eye candy: charlie spradling provides the obligatory t&a<SEP>0
i watch a lot of films good bad and indifferent; there is usually something of interest to fixate upon even if it is only set design or the reliable labor of a good character actor or the fortuitous laughter that emerges from watching ineptitude captured foreverhowever i was quite pleasantly surprised by this film one i had never seen before graham greene has been translated into film many times of course in such masterpieces as thin man and in lesser vehicles confidential agent is one of those lesser vehicles yet it manages to get me somewhere anyway despite lackluster direction the incongruity of bacall and boyers depictions as respectively british and spanish and the almost complete non-existence of any chemistry between the two leads in some ways this last problem actually begins to work in the films favor for how can love really blossom in the killing atmosphere of fascism and capitalism meeting about one persons tragedy the most compelling aspect of the film arises directly from greenes complex and guilt-ridden psychology which pervades the film i know some see the deliberate pacing here as dull and i can understand that yet i found that plodding accentuated rather than detracted from what is a claustrophobic world i was compelled to watch not by any great acting although boyer is marvelous as usual managing to convey a rich mixture of world-weariness tragedy hope and fervor with his magnificent voice and yearning eyes but by the down-spiraling rush of one mans slim hopes against a world of oppression and money what is a thief what good is love in the face of death where does mere profit-taking end and exploitation begin the film does not rise to the level of art and thus cannot hope to answer such questions but it is much more than mere entertainment and its murders and guilts are very grimly drawn the lack of glitz of bubble of narrative bounce help to make this movie very worthwhileand there is no happy ending for history wrote the ending<SEP>1
when you have two tower house of performers pitched against each other the least you can expect is the superb camaraderie and that is the case in this film where we have a 64 yrs old amitabh bachchan romances a 34-yr old tabu wait! in fact that is all there in the name of plot therefore instead of cheeni it is the content that is kum in this adman turned writer-director r balkis maiden efforttrust the two senior actors to bring the house down with their wise-cracks and bitter-sweet moments when love happened in this unconventional pair and that is all you find in slow but refreshing first half the locales of london as captured in rainy season are captivating by the end of first half romance completed and mission accomplished there is not much left to be said therefore in the second half a strange opposition comes in the form of girls father to the extent that he goes for a satyagrah is really a test of patience there is an equally strange climax about how he gives in the result second half is dry flat with no energy there is a subplot with a girl child dying of cancer not making much impact nonetheless the film is recommended for its fresh approach and the performances<SEP>0
danireese witherspoon has always been very close with her older sister maureenemily warfield until they both start falling in love with their neighbor courtjason london but it is not after a terrible tragedy strikes that the two sisters realize that nothing can keep them apart and that their love for each other will never fade awaythis was truly a heartbreaking story about first love probably the most painful story about young love that i have ever seen all the acting is amazing and reese witherspoon gives a great performance in her first movie i would give the man in the moon 8510<SEP>1
i enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst the gorilla looks just terrific and the eyes were especially lifelike its even a little scary at times and should have children slightly frightened without going over the top rene russo plays her role wonderfully feminine usually these type of hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a straw-man villain but the only adversary is the gorilla its an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans how they feel the same emotions we do and yet how we really cant treat them just like people because they arent not many films venture into this territory and its worth seeing if you want to contemplate the human-animal similarity<SEP>1
ive read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life eg what it takes to get into music school britney bashing etc etc so lets focus on the movie and the messagei have rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years and for a family movie for the average adult male 2 out of 10i like poprock music im 45 i know of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until i read the credits and these reviews i didnt recognise her poster on the wall so i was not worried about any self promotioni watch movies to be entertained i dont care about casting lighting producers directors etc what is the movie and does it entertain mei watched this movie for the message the worlds greatest epidemic is low self-esteem which is a whole other story so watched with the message in mind as that is an area of interest the movie is light bright and breezy great for kids i found the texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give updont give up message so yeh it was a bit predictable great message thoughshould be more of themthis movie is a great family movie but for a bloke watching by himself get hannibal<SEP>1
like other people who commented on fräulein doktor i stumbled by chance upon this little gem on late-night tv without having heard of it before the strange mixture of a pulp fiction story about a sexy but unscrupulous anti-heroine on the one hand and a realistic and well-researched portrayal of war in the trenches on the other hand had me hooked from the beginningto me this is one of the five best movies about wwi the others are all quiet on the western front paths of glory gallipoli and the post-war la vie et rien dautre and the scene with the poison gas attack is really chilling; the horses and men appear like riders of the apocalypse with their gas masksi only wish i had taped the film<SEP>1
title: zombie 3 1988 directors: mostly lucio fulci but also claudio fragasso and bruno mattei cast: ottaviano dellacqua massimo vani beatrice ring deran serafin review: to review this flick and get some good background of it i gotta start by the beginning and the beginning of this is really george romeros dawn of the dead when dawn came out in 79 lucio fulci decided to make an indirect sequel to it and call it zombie 2 that film is the one we know as plain ole zombie you know the one in which the zombie fights with the shark! ok so after that flick named zombie 2 in italy came out and made a huge chunk of cash the italians decided heck lets make some more zombie flicks! these things are raking in the dough! so zombie 3 was born confused yet the story on this one is really just a rehash of stories weve seen in a lot of american zombie flicks that we have seen before this one the best comparison that comes to mind is return of the living dead lets seetheres the government making experiments with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies canister gets released into the general population and shebang! we get loads of zombies yearning for human flesh a bunch of people start running away from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel they gotta fight the zombies to survivethere was a lot of trouble during the filming of this movie first and foremost lucio fulci the beloved godfather of gore from italy was sick so he couldnt really finish this film the way that he wanted to the film was then handed down to two lesser directors bruno mattei hell of the living dead and claudio fragasso zombie 4 they did their best to spice up a film that was already not so good you see fulci himself didnt really have his heart and soul on this flick he was disenchanted with it he gave the flick over to the producers and basically said: do whatever the hell you want with it! and god love them they didand that is why ladies and gents we have such a crappy zombie flick with the great fulci credited as its director the main problem in my opinion is that its just such a pointless bore! theres no substance to it whatsoever! after the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal the toxic gas and accidentally release it the rest of the flick is just a bunch of empty soulless characters with no personality whatsoever running from the zombies now in some cases this can prove to be fun if #1 the zombie make up and zombie action is actually good and fun and #2 theres a lot of gore and guts involvedhere we get neither! well theres some inspired moments in there like for example when some eagles get infected by the gas and they start attacking people that was cool theres also a scene involving a flying zombie head wich by the way defies all logic and explanation and a scene with zombies coming out of the pool of the abandoned hotel and munching off a poor girls legs but aside from thatthe rest of the flick just falls flat on its assendless upon endless scenes that dont do jack to move the already non existent plot along that was my main gripe with this flick the sets look unfinished and the art direction is practically non-existent i hate it when everything looks so damn unfinished! i like my b-movies but this one just really went even below that! its closer to a z-level flick if you ask methe zombie make up pure crap the zombies are all asian actors the movie was filmed in the philippines so you get a bunch of asian looking zombies but thats not a big problem since they movie was set in the phillipine islands anyway its the look of the zombies that really sucks! they all died with the same clothes on for some reason and what passes for zombie make up here is a bunch of black make up more like smudges on their faces one or two zombies had slightly more complex make up but it still wasnt good enough to impress its just a bunch of goo pointlessly splattered on the actors faces so not only is this flick slowly paced but the zombies look like crap these are supposed to be dead folks! anyhows for those expecting the usual coolness in a fulci flick dont come expecting it here cause this is mostly somebody elses flick and those two involved mattei and fragasso didnt really put there heart and souls into it in fact when you see the extras on the dvd you will see that when fragasso is asked about his recollections and his feelings on this here flick he doesnt even take it to seriously you can tell he is ashamed of it and in many occasions he says they just had a job to do and they did it and that my friends is the last nail on this flick theres no love and no heart put into making this film therefore you get a half assed crappy zombie flickonly for completest or people who want to have or see every zombie flick ever made everybody else dont even bother! rating: 1 out of 5<SEP>0
this movie is great fun to watch if you love films of the organized crime variety those looking for a crime film starring a charismatic lead with dreams of taking over in a bad way may be slightly disappointed with the way this film stridesit is a fun romp through a criminal underworld however and if you arent familiar with hong kong films then you may be pleasantly surprised by this one i was somewhat disappointed by some of the choices made story-wise but overall a good crime film some things did not make sense but that seems to be the norm with films of the east people just randomly do things regardless of how their personalities were set up prior its a slightly annoying pattern that permeates even in this film<SEP>1
this movie is one of my favourites it is a genre-mixture with ingredients of the action-horror-romantic-comedygenre some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards this minor flaw is easily ignored there is so much to discover in this story the romantic relation between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts the visuals are beautiful too the action is great which is no surprise it is originating from honkong birthplace of the worlds best action movies the humour sometimes seems a little bit silly but in a good way somehow this movie is being able to balance the different moods and keeps being good absolutely recommended<SEP>1
a lot of promise and nothing more an all-star cast certainly by hk standards but man oh man is this one a stinker no story thats okay the action will make up for it like most hk action flicks what the action is terrible corny and sparse dragon dynastys releases up to this point are by and large superb and generally regarded as classics in asian cinema this is a blight they managed to wrangle a couple of actors from infernal affairs but they cant bring life to a disjointed script there are scenes of dialogue where two or three lines are spoken with a cut in between each and no continuity in what the characters are saying you almost feel like theyre each giving a running monologue and just ignoring the other characters michael biehn is made of wood really sammo hung uses a stunt double no way yes way stay away<SEP>0
i rented this film to see what might be a bloody non stop action movie and got this overly sentimental and super cheap low budget action-drama that makes kickboxer look like die hard lou and reb are in vietnam and as lou saves reb from the gooks he gets shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever the vietnam scenes are shot in someones backyard i swear! lou is now brain damaged and reb and him live together and own a bar super homoerotic lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and reb goes on a killing spree to get him back there is no good fight scenes at all the punches are two inches away from a person characters personalities change in matter of seconds one guy is a bad and in the next scene hes good the acting is horrid and the music is some overly sentimental frank stallone sounding song that would make you sick i hated this film<SEP>0
this movie is not based on the bible it completely leaves christ out of the movie they do not show the rapture or the second coming of christ let alone talk about it it does not quote from scriptures the end times are called the great tribulation the movie does not even show bad times the seven bowls seven viles and seven trumpets of judgements are boiled down to a 15 second news cast of the sea changing its structure the anti-christ was killed 3 12 years into the tribulation and that is how the movie ended the only part they got correct was there was two prophets the did not use there names of course because that would be too close to the truth of scriptures the worst part of it was i really wanted it to be a good movie i wanted to take unsaved people to it i feel that the movie is evil it is a counterfeit just like everything the devil does i just hope it does not take away from the upcoming movie based on the left behind booksthe second problem with the movie is it was just bad bad acting bad special effects bad plot and poor character development i have seen better episodes of miami vice<SEP>0

this one came out during the western genre’s last gasp; unfortunately it emerges to be a very minor and altogether unsatisfactory effort – even if made by and with veterans in the field! to begin with the plot offers nothing remotely new: james coburn escapes from a chain gang intent on killing the man now retired who put him there – charlton heston while the latter lays a trap for him coburn outwits heston by kidnapping his daughter barbara hershey naturally the former lawman – accompanied by hershey’s greenhorn fiancé chris mitchum – sets out in pursuit of coburn and his followers all of whom broke jail along with himrather than handling the proceedings in his customary sub-fordian style mclaglen goes for a sam peckinpah approach – with which he’s never fully at ease: repellent characters plenty of violence and the sexual tension generated by hershey’s presence among coburn’s lusty bunch incidentally heston and coburn had previously appeared together in a sam peckinpah western – the troubled major dundee 1965; i really need to pick up the restored edition of this one on dvd though i recently taped the theatrical version in pan-and-scan format off tcm uk anyway the film is too generic to yield the elegiac mood it clearly strives for suggested also by the title: then again both stars had already paid a fitting valediction to this most american of genres – will penny 1968 for heston and coburn with pat garrett & billy the kid 1973! at least though heston maintains a modicum of dignity here – his ageing character attempting to stay ahead of half-breed coburn by anticipating what his next move will be; the latter however tackles an uncommonly brutish role and only really comes into his own at the climax relishing his moment of vengeance by sadistically forcing heston to witness his associates’ gang-rape of hershey apart from the latter this lengthy sequence sees heston try to fool coburn with a trick borrowed from his own el cid 1961 the villainous gang is then trapped inside a bushfire ignited by the practiced heston and the violent death of the two ‘obsolete’ protagonists as was his fashion heston’s demise takes the form of a gratuitous sacrifice!the supporting cast includes michael parks as the ineffectual town sheriff jorge rivero as coburn’s mexican lieutenant and larry wilcox – of the tv series chips! – as the youngest member of coburn’s gang who’s assigned the task of watching over hershey while doing his best to keep his drooling mates away! jerry goldsmith contributes a flavorful but at the same time unremarkable score<SEP>0
i dont know about you but what i love about tom and jerry cartoons is the often violent interaction between the two characters mouse in manhattan sees jerry leaving tom behind to have an adventure in new york and as far as i am concerned this one definitely suffers from a lack of cat!as magical as jerrys exploration of the big apple might be for the other t&j fans who have commented here on imdb i couldnt wait for this self-indulgent rubbish to end so i could watch the next cartoon on my dvdin fact the only part of the whole episode that i genuinely enjoyed was when jerry almost buys the farm hanging precariously off the end of a broken candle hundreds of feet above a busy road<SEP>0
i cannot say that aag is the worst bollywood film ever made because i havent seen every bollywood film but my imagination tells me that it could well bethis film seems like an attempt at artistic suicide on behalf of the director and i for one be believe he has been successful in his mission no a-list actor outside of this film would risk sharing the same billing as him for all the humiliation this film is bound to carry with itbut lets not just blame the director here there is the cinematographer who looks like hes rehearsing for the amateur home movie maker of the year award there is the over dramatic score that hopes to carry you to the next scene the lighting man who must have been holding a cigarette in one hand and light bulb on pole in the other and hoping that the flame burning off the cigarette would add to that much needed light in every scene and of course the actors! some of them are by no means newcomers else all could be forgiven here the ensemble of actors in aag were put together to promote a new beginning and dimension to the re-make of indias most loved movie of all time sholay one must not forget that these actors were not forced in to this film they are a-list and willing participants to something that lets face it would surely have had high and eager public expectation so it begs the question amitabh aside for now did the other actors really believe their performances even attempted to better the original did amitabh bachchan read the script and believe that people would remember his dialogue in this farcical abomination of a film dont be stupid of course he didnt this was a demonstration to the public of how much money talks hence can make actors walki truly hope everyone involved is satisfied with what is truly a vulgar attempt to remake a classic film which only succeeds in polluting everyones mind when they watch the original<SEP>0
what is the point of creating sequels that have absolutely no relevance to the original film no point this is why the prom night sequels are so embarrassingly badthe original film entailed a group of children hiding a dark secret that eventually get them all killed bar one in a brutal act of revenge can someone please explain to me what a dead prom queen-to-be rising from the grave to steel the crown has to do with the first movie then prom night 2 had continuous plot holes that left the audience constantly wondering how did that happen and why should that happen but in the end i guess you could call it one of those movies that is so bad you end up laughing yourself through it<SEP>0
this drummond entry is lacking in continuity most of them have their elements of silliness the postponed wedding and so on however this has an endless series of events occurring in near darkness as the characters run from one place to another the house seems more like a city theres also leo g carrol who is such an obvious suspect who no-one seems to even look at he is a stranger and acts rather suspicious but drummond and the folks dont seem to pick up on anything still it as reasonably good action and a pretty good endingi know that algie is supposed to be a comic figure but like nigel bruce in the rathbone sherlock holmes flicks he is so buffoonish that its hard to imagine anyone with taste or intelligence being around him is there a history behind him that will explain how he and drummond became associates<SEP>0
hollywood always had trouble coming to terms with a religious picture strange cargo proves to be no exception although utilizing the talents of a superb cast and produced on a top budget with suitably moody photography by robert planck the movie fails dismally on the credibility score perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements upsets the viewers involvement in the action and with the fate of the characters i found it difficult to sit still through all the contrived metaphors parallels and biblical references and impossible to accept bathed-in-light ian hunters smug know-it-all as a christ figure and the censors in boston detroit and providence at least agreed with me the movie was banned few bostondetroitprovidence moviegoers if any complained or journeyed to other cities because it was obvious from the trailer that gable and crawford had somehow become involved in a message picture it flopped everywhereoddly enough the movie has enjoyed something of a revival on tv a home atmosphere appears to make the movies allegory more receptive to viewers however despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film the plot of this strange cargo flows along predictable heavily moralistic lines that will have no-one guessing how the principal characters will eventually come to terms with destiny<SEP>0
being a music student myself i thought a movie taking place in a conservatory might be fun to watch little did i know i had no idea this movie was based on a book by britney spears this movie was implausible throughout its obvious that whoever wrote the script never set foot in a conservatory and doesnt know a thing about classical music let me give you just a few examples: 1 there is no way anyone would be admitted to a classical conservatory with no classical training whatsoever! just having a nice pop voice isnt enough besides thats a different thing altogether - another genre different technique its like playing the violin when applying for a viola class 2 how come the lady teaching music theory was in the singing jury if she wasnt a singing professor herself she would have no say in a situation like that and if she was a singing professor why werent we told so 3 being able to read music is a necessity if youre to major in music 4 how did angela get a hold of that video tape that would have been kept confidential for the jurys eyes only now either she got the tape from one of the professors or the script writers just didnt have a clue i wonder which 5 the singing professor gave holly the carmen song saying she had the range which she clearly did not yes she was able to sing the notes but carmen is a mezzo-soprano while hollys voice seemed to be much lighter in timbre not at all compatible with that song 6 worst of all: not only does the movie show a shocking ignorance when it comes to classical music but it doesnt even try to hide it the aria that angela sings is mutilated beyond recognition a fact which is painfully blatant at the recital where it is cut short in a disgraceful way - mozart would roll over in his grave the habanera from carmen sounded a bit weird at times too and the way it was rearranged at the end just shows how little the producers really think of classical music - its stiff and boring but hey add some drums and electric guitars and its almost as good as britney spears! i know these are all minor details but it would have been so easy to avoid them with just a little research anyhow i might have chosen to suspend my disbelief had the characters and the plot been well elaborated but without that i really cant find any redeeming qualities in this movie except for one: its good for a laugh<SEP>0
im not going to bother with a plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and theres almost no plot anyway ive seen several reviewers call isoyg an anti-rape film or even a feminist statement and i just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claimsfirst of all what do we see on the cover of this movie thats right: a shapely womans behind whether it was zarchis attempt to make an anti-rape statement - and i absolutely dont believe it was - is entirely beside the point the film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic everything but actual penetration is shown that no one but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy itthe rapes in the film is uncomfortable brutal and hard to watch theres something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes none there was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed mere moments before hes murdered so the scene isnt at all engaging on an emotional level really its just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies isoyg is associated with on imdb caligula cannibal ferox etc that it attracts only the exploitation crowdfinally a few reviewers have commended zarchis so-called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack but considering how inept everything else in the film is acting script etc i suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porn-caliber actors do their thingim not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of isoyg im all for exploitation horror and love video nasties in fact im giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films however its also poorly made and after the rape occurs just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of ho-hum mostly gore-less murders and wait for the credits to rollthis is probably worth watching once if youre a hardcore 70s exploitation fan but im telling you the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation<SEP>0
this was the first ppv in a new era for the wwe as hulk hogan the ultimate warrior ric flair and sherri martel had all left a new crop of talent needed to be pushed and this all started with lex luger a former nwa world heavyweight champion being given a title shot against yokozuna lex travelled all over the us in a bus called the lex express to inspire americans into rallying behind him in his bid to beat the japanese monster who was actually samoan and get the wwe championship back into american hands as such there was much anticipation for this matchbut every good ppv needs an undercard and this had some good stuffthe night started off with razor ramon defeating ted dibiase in a good match the story going into this was that dibiase had picked on ramon and even offered him a job as a slave after his shock loss to the 1-2-3 kid on raw in july ramon angry had then teamed with the 1-2-3 kid against the money inc tag team of ted dibiase and irwin r shyster to settle their differences they were both given one on one matches dibiase vs ramon and shyster vs the kid razor was able to settle his side of the deal after hitting a razors edgenext up came the steiner brothers putting the wwe tag team titles on the line against the heavenly bodies depsite the interference of the bodies manager jim cornette who hit scott steiner in the throat with a tennis racket they were able to pull out the win in a decent matchshawn michaels and mr perfect had been feuding since wrestlemania ix when shawn michaels confronted perfect after his loss to lex luger perfect had then cost michaels the intercontinental championship when he distracted him in a title match against marty janetty michaels had won the title back and was putting it on the line against mr perfect but michaels now had a powerful ally in his corner in his 7 foot bodyguard diesel micheals and perfect had an excellent match here but it was diesel who proved the difference maker pulling perfect out of the ring and throwing him into the steel steps for shawn to win by count outirwin r shyster avenged the loss of his tag team partner earlier in the night easily accounting for the 1-2-3 kidnext came one of the big matches of the night as bret hart prepared to battle jerry lawler for the title of undisputed king of the wwe but lawler came out with crutches saying hed been injured in a car accident earlier that day and that hed arranged another opponent for hart: doink the clown hart and doink had a passable match which hart won with a sharpshooter he was then jumped from behind by lawler this bought wwe president jack tunney to the ring who told lawler that he would receive a lifetime ban if he didnt wrestle hart hart then destroyed lawler winning with the sharpshooter but hart refused to let go of the hold and the referee reversed his decision so after all that lawler was named the undisputed king of the wwe this match was followed by ludvig borda destroying marty janetty in a short matchthe undertaker finished his long rivalry with harvey wippleman which had started in 1992 when the undertaker had defeated wipplemans client kamala at summerslam and continued when wipplemans latest monster the giant gonzales had destroyed taker at the rumble and then again at wrestlemania with a decisive victory over gonzales here gonzales then turned on wippleman chokeslamming him after a poor matchnext it was time for six man tag action as the smoking gunns bart and billy and tatanka defeated the headshrinkers samu and fatu and bam bam bigelow with tatanka pinning samuthis brings us to the main event with yokozuna flanked by jim cornette and mr fuji putting the wwe title on the line against lex luger and it was all on board the lex express lex came out attacking but yokozuna took control lex came back though as he was able to avoid a banzai drop and then body slam yokozuna before knocking him out of the ring luger then attacked cornette and fuji as yokozuna was counted out luger had won a fine match!!!!! balloons fell from the ceiling the heroes all came out to congratulate him on his win yokozuna may have retained the title but luger had proved he could be beaten the only question was who could beat him in the ring and get that title off him<SEP>1
i really dont get all the adulation that this film has received its mawkish unnecessarily manipulative and dodges many of the big issues - ie nashs affairs and his predilection for having sex with men in public places that i suppose in the context of a commercial hollywood film is just about tolerable but whats with all the praise for russell crowes performance the man just seems to shuffle about clutching his briefcase and wearing a grungy hat and somehow that seems to qualify as fine acting anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realise that crowes performance is little short of caricature it is also rather offensive and dare i say just on the right side of being truly terrible<SEP>0
de vierde man the fourth man 1984 is considered one of the best european pycho thrillers of the eighties this last work of dutch director paul verhoeven in his home country before he moved to hollywood to become a big star with movies like total recall basic instinct and starship troopers is about a psychopathic and disillusioned author jeroen krabbe going to the seaside for recovering there he meets a mysterious femme fatale renee soultendieck and starts a fatal love affair with her he becomes addicted to her with heart and soul and finds out that her three previous husbands all died with mysterious circumstancesde vierde man is much influenced by the old hollywood film noire and the psycho thrillers of alfred hitchcock and orson wells it takes much time to create a dark and gripping atmosphere and a few moments of extreme graphic violence have the right impact to push the story straight forward the suspense is sometimes nearly unbearable and sometimes reminds of the works of italian cult director dario argentothe cast is also outstanding especially krabbes performance as mentally disturbed writer that opened the doors for his international film career the living daylights the fugitive if you get the occasion to watch this brilliant psycho thriller on tv video or dvd dont miss it!<SEP>1
this is a great movie i like it where ning climbs down to get his ink and the skeletons chase him but luckily he dodged them opened the window and didnt even notice them xiao qian is very pretty too & when he stuck the needle up ma wus butt its hysterical and when he is saying love is the greatest thing on earth while standing between two swords is great too then also the part where he eats his buns while watching thew guy kill many people then you see him chanting poems as he ran to escape the wolves the love scenes are romantic xiao qian and ning look cute together add the comic timing the giant tongue and u have horror romance comedy all at once not to mention superb special effects for the 90s<SEP>1
i should never have started this film and stopped watching after 34s i missed the really botched ending this film was a disappointment because it could have been so much better it had nice atmosphere a top notch cast and director good locations but a baaaaaad story line a bad script i paid attention to kenneth branaghs southern accent--it was better than the script the plot was stupid--driven by characters acting in unreal and improbable ways no one behaves like this outside of hollywood scripts<SEP>0
i didnt even know this was originally a made-for-tv movie when i saw it but i guessed it through the running time it has the same washed-out colors bland characters and horrible synthesized music that i remember from the 80s plus a social platform that practically screams afterschool special anyhoorona jaffes thank you mazes and monsters was made in the heyday of dungeons & dragons a pen-and-paper rpg that took the hearts of millions of geeks around america i count myself one of said geeks tho i have never played d&d specifically i have dabbled in one of its brethren m&m was also made in the heyday of d&ds major controversy-that it was so engrossing that people could lose touch with reality be worshiping satan without knowing blah blah i suppose it was a legitimate concern at one point if extremely rare-but it dates this movie horrendouslywe meet 4 young college students who play the aptly named mazes and monsters to socialize and have a little time away from mundane life except that m&m as presented is more boring than their mundane lives none of the allure of gaming is presented here-and jay jays request to take m&m into the real world comes out of nowhere its just an excuse to make one of the characters go crazy out of nowhere also-though at that point we dont really care jay jay robbie kate and daniel are supposed to be different-but theyre all rich waspy prigs who have problems no one really hasbut things just continue getting worse in more ways than one the low budget comes dreadfully clear i love the entrance sign and cardboard cutout to the forbidden caverns robbiepardu shows why hes not a warrior in the oafiest stabbing scene ever and the payoff atop the two towers is unintentionally hilarious tom hanks blubbering jay jay what am i doing here made me laugh for minutes on end definitely the low point in his careerdont look at it as a cogent satire just a laughable piece of 80s tv trash and youll still have a good time that is if you can stay awake the majority is mostly boring but its all worthwhile for pardus breakdown at the end at least tom hanks has gotten better not that he could go much worse from here<SEP>0
i came across this film by accident when listing all the films i wanted my sister to record for me whilst i was on holiday and i am so glad that i included this one it deals with issues that most directors shy away from my only problem with this film is that it was made for tv so i couldnt buy a copy for my friend!its a touching story about how people with eating disorders dont necessarily shy away from everyone and how many actually have dieting buddies it brought to my attention that although bulimics can maintain a fairly stable weight it has more serious consequences on their health that many people are ignorant of<SEP>1
really everybody in this movie looks like they want to be someplace else! no wonder the casting is done not with the left hand but rather not at all i havent seen anything worse than natascha mcelhone impersonating some sort of agent carrying a gun you dont use a spoiled city-brat-look in such a role the only worse thing i can imagine is casting doris day as a prostitute the rest of the cast is likewise awful possibly with hurt as the sole exception sometimes you can see him trying but suffering oh did i mention that it is a completely insane story jeopardizing many peoples lives because you are divorced and want to see your family well it must be because the guy weller is german210 because the photography could be worse<SEP>0
when an attempt is made to assassinate the emir of ohtar an arab potentate visiting washington dc his life is saved by a cocktail waitress named sunny davis sunny becomes a national heroine and media celebrity and as a reward is offered a job working for the protocol section of the united states department of state unknown to her however the state department officials who offer her the job have a hidden agendaa map we see shows ohtar lying on the borders of saudi arabia and south yemen in an area of barren desert known as the rub al-khali or empty quarter in real life a state in this location would have a population of virtually zero and virtually zero strategic value but for the purposes of the film we have to accept that ohtar is of immense strategic importance in the cold war and that the american government who are keen to build a military base there need to do all that they can in order to keep on the good side of its ruler it transpires that the emir has taken a fancy to the attractive young woman who saved him and he has reached a deal with the state department; they can have their base provided that he can have sunny as the latest addition to his harem sunnys new job is just a ruse to ensure that the emir has further opportunities to meet hera plot like this could have been the occasion for some hilarious satire but in fact the films satirical content is rather toned down possibly in 1984 the american public were not in the mood for trenchant satire on their countrys foreign policy; this was after all the year in which ronald reagan carried forty-nine out of fifty states in the presidential election and his hard line with the soviet union was clearly going down well with the voters if the film had been made a couple of years later in the wake of the irancontra affair its tone might have been differentthe film is not so much a satire as a vehicle for goldie hawn to show off her brand of cuteness and charm sunny is a typical goldie character- pretty sweet-natured naive and not too bright there is however a limit to how far you can go with cuteness and charm alone and you cannot automatically make a bad film a good one just by making the leading character a dumb blonde actually that sounds more like a recipe for making a good film a bad one goldie tries her best to save this one but never succeeds part of the reason is the inconsistent way in which her character is portrayed on the one hand sunny is a sweet innocent country girl from oregon on the other hand she is a 35-year-old woman who works in a sleazy bar and wears a revealing costume the effect is rather like imagining rebecca of sunnybrook farm grown up and working as a bunny girlthe more important reason why goldie is unable to rescue this film is even the best comedian or comedienne is no better than hisher material and protocol is simply unfunny whatever humour exists is tired and strained relying on offensive stereotypes about arab men who apparently all lust after western women particularly if they are blonde and blue-eyed there was a lot of this sort of thing about in the mid-eighties as this was the period which also saw the awful ben kingsley nastassia kinski film harem about a lascivious middle eastern ruler who kidnaps a young american woman and the mini-series of the same name which told a virtually identical story with a period setting the film-makers seem to have realised that their film would not work as a pure comedy because towards the end it turns into a sort of latter-day mr smith goes to washington sunny turns from a blonde bimbo into a fount of political wisdom and starts uttering all sorts of platitudes about democracy and the constitution and the citizens duty to vote and we the people and how the price of liberty is eternal vigilance blah blah blah but in truth the film is no more successful as a political parable than it is as a comedygoldie hawn has made a number of good comedies such as cactus flower overboard and housesitter but protocol is not one of them i have not seen all of her films but of those i have seen this dire comedy is by far the worst 310<SEP>0

i have seen virtually all of cynthia rothrocks films and to me this is the funniest it reminds me of early jackie chan movies admittedly ms rothrock may not be the greatest actress but she is very good to watch as both a martial artist and as a very cute young lady this film while probably not the best of all her films was the most entertaining<SEP>1
a patient escapes from a mental hospital killing one of his keepers and then a university professor after he makes his way to the local college next semester the late profs replacement and a new group of students have to deal with a new batch of killings the dialogue is so clichéd it is hard to believe that i was able to predict lines in quotes this is one of those cheap movies that was thrown together in the middle of the slasher era of the 80s despite killing the heroine off this is just substandard junk horrible acting horrible script horrible effects horrible horrible horrible!! splatter university is just gunk to put in your vcr when you have nothing better to do although i suggest watching your head cleaner tape that would be more entertaining skip it and rent girls nite out insteadrated r for strong graphic violence profanity brief nudity and sexual situations<SEP>0
i have seen about a thousand horror films my favorite type this film is among the worst for me an idea drives a movie so even a poorly acted cheaply made movie can be good something weird is definitely cheaply made however it has little to say i still dont understand what the karate scene in the beginning has to do with the film something weird has little to offer save yourself the pain!<SEP>0
this is a collection of documentaries that last 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame from artists all over the world the documentaries are varied and deal with all sorts of concepts the only thing being shared is 911 as a theme very minor in some cases some of the segements are weak while others are very strong; some are political some are not; some are solely about 911 some simply use 911 as a theme to touch on human feelings emotions and tragedies that are universal; some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic this film has not been censored in any fashion by anyone so the thoughts that you see are very raw and powerfulthis is a very controversial film especially for conservative americans i think two segments might really tick off the right wingers one from egypt where a dead american soldier and a dead palestinian bomber come back as spirits; another from uk which recounts the us-backed overthrow of chile on sept 11 1973 which resulted in 50000 deaths and horrible atrocities the segment from mexico was the most powerful recounting the fall of the towers and the resulting death in vivid fashion you have to see it to believe iteven though the final product is uneven with some segments being almost pointless i still recommend this its very difficult to rank this film because the segments vary all over the place some weak some very powerful; im giving this a rating of 9 out of 10 simply because some segments were excellent and covered issues that usually get censored mexico segment uk segment japan segment egypt segment<SEP>1
this movie has a lot of comedy not dark and gordon liu shines in this one he displays his comical side and it was really weird seeing him get beat up his training is unorthodox and who wouldve thought knot tying could be so deadly lots of great stunts and choreography very creative!add johnny wang in the mix and youve got an awesome final showdown! dont mess with manchu thugs; theyre ruthless!<SEP>1
have not watched kids films for some years so i missed here come the tigers when it first came out never even saw bad news bears even though in the 70s i worked for the guys who arranged financing for that movie warriors man who would be king and rocky horror picture show among others now i like to check out old or small movies and find people who have gone on to great careers despite being in a less than great movie early on just minutes into this movie i could take no more and jumped to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone on to bigger and better things--at least watching for hisher appearance would create some interest as the plot and acting werent doing the job lo and behold i spied wes cravens name in the credits as an electrical gaffer hed already made two or three of his early shockers but had not yet created freddie krueger or made the scream movies maybe he owed a favor and helped out on this pic more surprising was fred j lincoln in the cast credits as aesop a wacky character in the movie fj lincoln from the 70s to just a few years ago appeared in and produced adult films he was associated with the adult spoof the ozporns and just that title is funnier than all of tigers attempts at humor combined let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a kids movie be an indication as to how the people making this movie must have been asleep at the wheel<SEP>0
you probably heard this phrase when it come to this movie  herbie: fully loaded with crap and yes it is true this movie is really dreadful and totally lamethis got to be the second worst movie lindsey is ever in since confession of the teenage drama queen the only good thing about this movie seem to be the over talent cast which by far is better than the movie million times and is the only selling point of the movie i dont see how such a respected actor like matt dillon could be a part of this movie isnt he read that horrible screenplay before he sign on to be in it what i didnt like about this movie is also base on how herbie is surreal and fantasy like extraordinary ability and climb on wall and go faster than a racer car after all it just a beatle i know it is a kids movie but they have gone overboard with it and it just turn out more silly than entertaining little realism is needed plus the story is way too predictablefinal words: unless the kids are actually 5 -12 years i highly doubt that any one could enjoy this senseless movie what wastage of my money i feel like cheatedrating: 310 grade: f<SEP>0
i was about thirteen when this movie came out on television it is far superior in action than most movies since martin sheen is excellent and though nick nolte has a small part he too provides excellent support vic morrow as the villain is superbwhen sheen tests the water in his 34 ford cool along the mountainous highway it is spectacular!the ending is grandim disappointed in the low vote this received i figure the younger generations have more interest in much of the junk that is coming out these daysgood taste eludes the masses!<SEP>1
it takes patience to get through david lynchs eccentric but-- for a change-- life-affirming chronicle of alvin straights journey but stick with it though it moves as slow as straights john deere when he meets the kind strangers along his pilgrimage we learn much about the isolation of aging the painful regrets and secrets and ultimately the power of family and reconciliation richard farnsworth caps his career with the years most genuine performance sad and poetic flinty and caring and sissy spacek matches him as his slow daughter rose who pines over her own private loss while caring for dad rarely has a modern film preached so positively about family<SEP>1

this miracle of a movie is one of those films that has a lasting long term effect on you ive read a review or two from angry people who i guess are either republicans or child beaters and their extremist remarks speak of the films power to confront people with their own darkest secrets no such piece of art has ever combined laughter and tears in me before and that is the miracle of the movie the realism of the movie and its performance by bret carr is not to be missed the very nature of its almost interactive effect will cause people to leave the theater either liberated or questioning their very identity bravo on the next level of cinema<SEP>1
oh sam mraovich we know you tried so hard this is your magnum opus a shining example to the rest of us that you are certainly worth nomination into the academy of motion picture arts and sciences as you state on your 1998-era web site alas its better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt with ben & arthur you do just thatseemingly assembled with a lack of instruction or education the films screenplay guides us toward the truly bizarre with each new scene its this insane excuse of a story that may also be the films best ally beginning tepidly the homosexually titular characters ben and arthur attempt to marry going so far as to fly across country to do so in the shade of vermonts finest palm trees but all of this posturing is merely a lead-in for blood then more blood and more and more blood i mean there must be at least $20 in fake blood make-up in the final third of this filmthe film in its entirety is a technical gaffe from the sound to the editing to the music which consists of a single fuzzy bass note being held on a keyboard its a wonder that the film even holds together on whatever media you view it on its such a shame then that some decent amateur performances are wasted hereno matter sam im sure youve made five figures on this flick in rentals or whatever drives poor souls such as myself to view this film sadly were not laughing with you<SEP>0
i love midnight cowboy and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine what is interesting to me is how when midnight cowboy came out in 1969 it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated x of course at that time x meant maturity since i was only two years old at the time of the movies release it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then however when i try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film which included prostitution the title itself was slang for a male prostitute; homosexuality; loneliness; physical and to some extent emotional as well abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day i can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release it is worth noting that in the 1970s midnight cowboy was downgraded to an r rating and even though it is still rated r some of the scenes could almost be rated pg-13 by todays standardsi want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie jon voight plays a young man named joe buck from texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in new york city escorting rich women he emulates cowboy actors like roy rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women after being rejected by all the women he has come across he meets a sleazy con-man named enrico ratso rizzo who is played by dustin hoffman ratso convinces joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager once again joe is conned and before long is homeless however joe comes across ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment without giving away much more of the plot i want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with joe and ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams ie joe making it as a gigolo and ratso going down to florida where he thinks he can regain his healthi want to make some comments about the movie itself first of all the acting is excellent especially the leads although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end there are some classic scenes in fact there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny i find them amusing for example there is the classic scene where dustin hoffman and jon voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over dustin hoffman bangs on the cab and says hey im walkin here! im walkin here! i get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of new york city where so many people are in a hurry another scene that comes to mind is the scene where ratso dustin hoffman sends joe jon voight to a guy named odaniel what is amusing is that at first we think odaniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that odaniel is nothing but a religious nut in addition to the two scenes i mentioned i love the scene where ratso and joe are arguing in their apartment when ratso says to joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and joe says in self-defense john wayne! you gonna tell me hes a fag! what i like is the delivery in that scenei would say that even though midnight cowboy was set in the late 60s much of it rings true today thats because although the area around 42nd street in new york has been cleaned up in the form of disneyfication in the last several years homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was 40 years ago also many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the jon voight character one thing that impresses me about jon voights character is how he is a survivor and i felt that at the end of the movie he had matured a great deal and that ratso dustin hoffmans character was a good influence on himin conclusion i want to say that i suggest that when watching this movie one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on for example there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings also what i find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with joe buck jon voights character and the people who were in his life in texas even the ending while i dont want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie is rather open-ended<SEP>1
shannon leethe daughter of bruce leedelivers high kicking martial arts action in spades in this exhilarating hong kong movie and proves that like her late brother brandon she is a real chip off the old block there is high tech stuntwork to die for in this fast paced flick and the makers of the bond movies should give it a look if they want to spice up the action quotient of the next 007 adventure as there is much innovative stuff here with some fresh and original second unit work to bolster up the already high action content of and nowyoure dead when you watch a movie as fast paced and entertaining as this you begin to wonder how cinema itself was able to survive before the martial arts genre was createdi genuinely believe that movies in general and action movies in particular were just marking time until the first kung fu movies made their debut bruce lee was the father of modern action cinema and his legitimate surviving offspring shannon does not let the family name down herealthough there are several pleasing performances in this movie michel wong for oneit is shannon lee whom you will remember for a genuinely spectacular performance as mandy the hitgirl supremehell;you may well come away whistling her fights!<SEP>1

reda is a young frenchman of moroccan descent despite his muslim heritage he is very french in attitudes and values out of the blue his father announces that reda will be driving him to the hajj pilgrimage to mecca--something that reda has no interest in doing but agrees only out of obligation as a result from the start reda is angry but being a traditional muslim man his father is difficult to talk to or discuss his misgivings both father and son seem very rigid and inflexible--and its very ironic when the dad tells his son that he should not be so stubbornwhen i read the summary it talks about how much the characters grew and began to know each other however i really dont think they did and that is the fascinating and sad aspect of the film sure there were times of understanding but so often there was an undercurrent of hostility and repression i actually liked this and appreciated that there wasnt complete resolution of this--as it would have seemed phonyoverall the film is well acted and fascinating--giving westerners an unusual insight into islam and the hajj it also provides a fascinating juxtaposition of traditional islam and the secular younger generation while the slow pace and lack of clarity about the relationship throughout the film may annoy some i think it gave the film intense realism and made it look like a film about people--not some formula a nice and unusual film<SEP>1
really bad shot on video film made by not one not two but three amateur video makersif youre going to make a bad horror film at least throw in some blood gore and nudity there is some blood provided by latex cut off arm props bought at a halloween store there are lesbians and hookers but no nudity or sex the lesbians spend a lot of time in bed but only talkingthere seems to be no editing effects- fades wipes etc once in a while a bit of black appears to separate scenesterrible music by bad heavy metal bands whose websites take up the majority of the end creditsthe werewolves are represented by rubber masks that are attached to just the actors face they didnt even bother to apply brown makeup to their necks arms or wristsi guarantee a 10 year old with a video camera could put together a better movieno reason at all to buy rent or watch this film except as an example of how not to make a low budget video<SEP>0
i dont know what would be so great about this movie even worse why should anyone bother seeing this one first of all there is no story one could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling laughter cry fear but in my opinion this movie does not do that eitheryou are just watching images for +- 2 hrs there are more useful things to doi guess you could say the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it lacks all the above but is this worth 2 hrs of your valuable time and 7 eur of your money for me the answer is: no<SEP>0
this was an awful movie! not for the subject matter but for the delivery i went with my girlfriend at the time when the movie came out expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression what we saw was 2 hours of brutal police oppression with no uplift at the end the previews and ads made no mention of this! plus for all that they played up whoopi goldberg my recollection is that she is arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! again the previews say nothing about this! not that you would expect that but its just more of the problem if i had known how depressing this movie would be i wouldve never have seen it or at least i wouldve been prepared for it this was a bait and switch ad campaign and i will never see this movie again!<SEP>0
i am uncertain what to make of this misshapen 2007 dramedy attempting to be a new millennium cross-hybrid between on golden pond and the prince of tides this film ends up being an erratic mess shifting so mercurially between comedy and melodrama that the emotional pitch always seems off the main problem seems to be the irreconcilable difference between garry marshalls sentimental direction and mark andrus dark rather confusing screenplay the story focuses on the unraveling relationship between mother lilly and daughter rachel who have driven all the way from san francisco to small-town hull idaho where grandmother georgia lives the idea is for lilly to leave rachel for the summer under georgias taskmaster jurisdiction replete with her draconian rules since the young 17-year old has become an incorrigible hellionthe set-up is clear enough but the characters are made to shift quickly and often inexplicably between sympathetic and shrill to fit the contrived contours of the storyline it veers haphazardly through issues of alcoholism child molestation and dysfunctional families until it settles into its pat resolution the three actresses at the center redeem some of the dramatic convolutions but to varying degrees probably due to her off-screen reputation and her scratchy smokers voice lindsay lohan makes rachels promiscuity and manipulative tactics palpable although she becomes less credible as her character reveals the psychological wounds that give a reason for her hedonistic behavior felicity huffman is forced to play lilly on two strident notes - as a petulant resentful daughter to a mother who never got close to her and as an angry alcoholic mother who starts to recognize her own accountability in her daughters state of mind she does what she can with the role on both fronts but her efforts never add up to a flesh-and-blood human beingat close to seventy jane fonda looks great even as weather-beaten as she is here and has the star presence to get away with the cartoon-like dimensions of the flinty georgia the problem i have with fondas casting is that the legendary actress deserves far more than a series of one-liners and maternal stares between this and 2005s execrable monster-in-law it does make one wonder if her best work is behind her it should come as no surprise that the actresses male counterparts are completely overshadowed garrett hedlund looks a little too surfer-dude as the naïve harlan a devout mormon whose sudden love for rachel could delay his two-year missionary stint cary elwes plays on a familiar suspicious note as lillys husband an unfortunate case where predictable casting appears to telegraph the movies endingthere is also the omnipresent dermot mulroney in the morose triple-play role of the wounded widower lillys former flame and rachels new boss as town veterinarian dr simon ward laurie metcalf has a barely-there role as simons sister paula while marshall regular hector elizondo and songsmith paul williams show up in cameos some of andrus dialogue is plain awful and the wavering seriocomic tone never settles on anything that feels right there are several small extras with the 2007 dvd none all too exciting marshall provides a commentary track that has plenty of his trademark laconic humor there are several deleted scenes including three variations on the ending and a gag reel a seven-minute making-of featurette is included as well as the original theatrical trailer a six-minute short spotlighting the three actresses and a five-minute tribute to marshall<SEP>0
this movie is truly brilliant it ducks through banality to crap at such speed you dont even see good sense and common decency to mankind go whizzing past but it doesnt stop there! this movie hits the bottom of the barrel so hard it bounces back to the point of ludicrous comedy: behold as kor the beergutted conan wannabe with the over-abundance of neck hair struts his stuff swinging his sword like theres no tomorrow and the way he swung it i really am amazed there *was* a tomorrow for him or at least for his beer gut dont miss this movie its a fantastic romp through idiocy and sheer bloody mindedness! and once you have finished watching this one dry the tears of joy or tears of frustration at such an inept attempt at storytelling from your eyes because some stupid f00l gave these people another $5 to make a sequel!<SEP>0
yep lots of shouting screaming cheering arguing celebrating fist clinching high fiving & fighting you have a general idea as to why but can never be 100% certain a naval knowledge would be an advantage for the finer points but then youd probably spot the many flaws not an awful film & hackman & washington are their usual brilliant but the plot was one you could peg pretty early on im still waiting to see a submarine film where people get on with each other & dont argue but then you probably wouldnt have a film410<SEP>0
this film reminds me of 42nd street starring bebe daniels and ruby keeler when i watch this film a lot of it reminded me of 42nd street especially the character eloise whos a temperamental star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle like bebe daniels did in 42nd street and another performer gets the part and become a star this film like most race films keeps people watching because of the great entertainment race films always showed black entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era the dancing styles the music dressing styles youll love it this movie could of been big if it was made in hollywood it would of had better scenery better filming and more money which would make any movie better but its worth watching because it is good and micheaux does good with the little he has i have to say out of all micheauxs films swing is the best! the movie features singers dancers actresses and actors who were popular but forgotten today doli armena a awesome female trumpet player who can blow the horn so good that you think gabriel is blowing a horn in the sky the sexy hot female dancer consuela harris would put ann miller and gyspy rose lee to shameadding further info popular blues singer of the 20s and 30s cora green is the focus of the film shes mandy a good hard working woman with a no good man who takes her money and spend it on other women a nosy neighbor played by amanda randolph tells mandy what she seen and heard and mandy goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive curvy woman by the name of eloise played hazel diaz a hot-cha entertainer in the 30s and a fight breaks out then mandy goes to harlem where she reunites with a somewhat guardian angel lena played by one of the most beautiful women in movies dorothy van engle lena provides mandy with a home a job and helps her become a star when temperamental cora smith played by hazel i guess shes playing two parts or maybe she changed her stage name tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior when cora gets drunk and breaks her leg lena convinces everyone that mandy is right for the job and lena is right and a star is born in mandy tall long lanky but handsome carman newsome is the cool aspiring producer who lena looks out for as well pretty boy larry seymour plays the no good man but after lena threatens him he might shape up there are a few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where cora smith hazel diaz struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but thats not enough she almost gets into a fight with mandy again in between theres great entertainment by chorus girls tap dancers shake dancers swing music and blues singing theres even white people watching the entertainment i wonder where micheaux found them theres even a scene where theres blacks and whites sitting together at the club micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films he should be commended for such a bold movethis movie was the first race film i really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to oscar micheaux this movie is one of the best of the race film genre its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show businessno these early race films may not be the best cant be compared with hallelujah green pastures stormy weather cabin in the sky carmen jones or any other hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black film-making and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black persons eyes these films gave blacks a chance to play people from all walks of life be beautiful classy and elegant and not just be stereotypes or how whites felt blacks should be portrayed like in hollywood most of the actors and actresses of these race films werent the best but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time micheaux and spencer williams couldnt afford nina mae mckinney josephine baker ethel waters fredi washington paul robeson rex ingram and more of the bigger stars so micheaux and other black and white race film-makers would use nightclub performers in their movies some were good some werent great actors and actresses but i think micheaux and others knew most werent good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent they just wanted their stories told and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films for some true actorsactresses race films were the only type of films they could get work especially if they didnt want to play hollywood stereotypes so i think youll be able to spot the true actorsactresses from the nightclub performers these race films are very historic they could have been lost forever many are lost maybe race films arent the greatest example of cinema but even hollywood films didnt start out great in the beginning i think if the race film genre continued it would have better if your looking for great acting most race films arent the ones but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films than watch race films there are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast moon over harlem body and soul paradise in harlem keep punching sunday sinners dark manhattan broken strings boy! what a girl mystery in swing miracle in harlem and sepia cinderella that not only has good entertainment but good acting<SEP>1
i also saw this amazingly bad piece of anime at the london sci-fi festival if you have to watch this thing do so with a large audience preferably after a few beers you may then glean some enjoyment from it i found the dialogue hilarious lodged in my mind is the introduction of cremator the animation is awful it is badly designed and badly executed it may have been a good idea for the producers to have hired at least one person who was not colour blindtheres nothing else to say really this film is a failure on every level<SEP>0
this is the best emma in existence in my opinion having seen the other version 1996 which is also good and read the book i think i can safely say with confidence that this is the true interpretation and is the most faithful to jane austens masterpiece the 1996 movie with g paltrow is good too its just that its almost like a different story altogether its very light and fluffy you dont see the darker edges of the characters and if you just want a pleasant movie that one would do fine but the intricacies of some of the plot points such as the churchillfairfax entanglement is so much glossed over as to be virtually non-existent but if you want the characters fleshed out a bit more real and multidimensional the 1996 tv version is the superior emma is a remarkable person but she is flawed kate beckinsale is masterful at showing the little quirks of the character you see her look casually disgusted at some of the more simple conversation of harriet smith yet she shows no remorse for having ruined harriets proposal until that action has the effect of ruining her own marital happiness at the ending you see her narcissism and it mirrors frank churchills in that they would do harm to others to achieve their own aims for emma it was playing matchmaker and having a new friend to while away the time with after having suffered the loss of her governess to marriage for frank churchill it is securing the promise of the woman he loves while treating her and others abominably to keep the secret in the book she realizes all of this in a crushing awakening to all the blunders she has made both kate beckinsale and gyneth paltrow are convincing in their remorse but paltrows is more childlike and stagnant while beckinsales awakening is rather real and serious and you see the transition from child-like selfish behavior to kind and thoughtful adult both versions are very good but i prefer this one<SEP>1
actress ruth romans real-life philanthropic gesture to help entertain troops arriving from and leaving for the korean war at an air base near san francisco jump-started this all-star warner bros salute to patriotism and song many celebrities make guest appearances while a love-hate romance develops between a budding starlet and a painfully green and skinny air force corporal ron hagerthy who looks like he should be delivering newspapers from his bicycle seems the corporal has fooled the actress into thinking hes off to battle when actually hes part of a airplane carrier crew flying to and from honolulu youd think shed be happy he was staying out of harms way but instead she acts just like most childish females in 1950s movies doris day is around for the first thirty minutes or so and her distinct laugh and plucky song numbers are most pleasant roman is also here looking glamorous while james cagney pokes fun at his screen persona and gordon macrae sings in his handsome baritone jane wyman sings too in a hospital bedside reprise following doris days lead causing one to wonder did they run out of sets for undemanding viewers an interesting flashback to another time and place still the low-rent production and just-adequate technical aspects render starlift strictly a second-biller *12 from ****<SEP>0
ok forget all the technical inconsisties or the physical impossibilities of the space shuttle accidentally being launched by a quirky robot with a heart of gold forget the hideous special effects and poorly-constructed one-dimensional characters just looking at the premise of the story the very reason for the film to exist in the first place and you will see just how badly this film was pieced togetheri know 9 year olds that look at this insult to the intelligence and just laugh at it the story is horrible the acting is comical and the message its trying to show is incomprehensible and whats worse is that the cable movie channels keep showing it! its on twice a day every two or three days! why does anyone in their right mind think that people would want to see this painful piece of celluloid multiple times much less to see it at allmy recomendation is dont even bother spending the energy to watch this thing its just not worth it<SEP>0
have i ever seen a film more shockingly inept i can think of plenty that equal this one but none which manage to outdo it the cast are all horrible stereotypes lumbered with flat dialogue i am ashamed for all of the people involved in making this each one wears an expression of fear not generated by the plot but by the realisation that this project could easily nix their career even the many charms of ms diaz dont provide an adequate reason to subject yourself to this avoid its obviously a style of film that americans havent really got a grasp of watch the final result if you must and youll see what im talking about but dont say i didnt warn you<SEP>0
i cannot believe that this movie was ever created i think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse the zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup the zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes finally there are maybe five or six zombies total definitely not a nation the best part of the movie if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished again to reiterate other user comments the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie also there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all it is never explained<SEP>0
generally over rated movie which boasts a strong cast and some clever dialog and of course dean martin songs problem is nicholas cage there is no chemistry between he and cher and they are the central love story cher almost makes up for this with her reactions to cages shifting accent and out of control body language cage simply never settles into his role he tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than real person and thats whats needed in a love story cage has had these same kind of performance problems in other roles that require more of a jimmy stewart type character cage keeps taking these roles perhaps because he likes those kind of movies but his own energy as an actor doesnt lend itself to them though hes gotten better at it with repeated attempts he should leave these type of roles to less interesting actors who would fully commit to the film and spend his energy and considerable talent in more off beat roles and films where he can be his crazy interesting self<SEP>0
every motion picture bette davis stars in is worth experiencing before davis co-stars with leslie howard in of human bondage shed been in over a score of movies legend has it that davis was robbed of a 1935 oscar for her performance as a cockney-speaking waitress unwed mother & manipulative boyfriend-user mildred rogers the story goes that the afi consoled davis by awarding her 1st oscar for playing joyce heath in dangerous i imagine davis fans of of human bondage who agree with the oscar-robbing legend are going to have at my critiques contrast of the 1934 film for which the afi didnt award her performance & the 1936 film dangerous performance for which she received her 1st oscar in 1937ive tried to view all of bette davis motion pictures tv interviews videos advertisements for wwii & tv performances in popular series in hindsight it is easy to recognize why this film of human bondage gave davis the opportunity to be nominated for her performance she was only 25yo when the film was completed & just about to reach hollywoods red carpet the public began to notice bette davis as a star because of her performance in of human bondage that is what makes it her legendary performance but rko saw her greatness in the man who played god & borrowed her from warners to play rogersim going to go with the afi in hindsight some 41 years after their astute decision to award davis her 1st best actress oscar for dangerous 2 years later by doing so the afi may have been instrumental in bringing out the very best in one of hollywoods most talented 20th century actors because from of human bondage onward davis knew for certain that she had to reach deep inside of herself to find the performances that earned her the golden statue doubtless she deserved more than 2 oscars; perhaps as many as 6dangerous provides an exemplary contrast in davis depth of acting characterization for its in dangerous 1936 that she becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century davis is so good as joyce heath shes dead-center on the red carpet whereas in of human bondage davis is right off the edge still on the sidewalk & ready to take off on the rest of her 60 year acting careerperhaps by not awarding her that legendary oscar in 1935 instead of a star being born an actor was given incentive to reach beyond stardom into her soul for the gifted actors greatest workit is well known that her contemporary peer adversary was joan crawford; a star whose performances still dont measure up to davis even anna nicole smith was a star howard stern is a radio host star too lots of people on stage & the silver screen are stars few became great actors the key difference between them is something that bette davis could sense: the difference between the desire to do great acting or to become star-strucktry comparing these two movies as i have viewing one right after the other maybe youll recognize what the afi & i did davis was on the verge of becoming one of the greatest actors of the 20th century at 25yo & achieved her goal by the time she was 27 she spent her next 50 plus years setting the bar so high that it has not been reached yethad the afi sent her the message that shed arrived in of human bondage davis life history as a great actor may have been led into star-struck-dom instead<SEP>1
must confess to having seen a few howlers in my time but this one is up there with the worst of them plot troubling to follow sex and violence thrown in to disorient and distract from the really poorly put together filmi can only imagine that the cast will look back on the end product and wish it to gather dust on a shelf not to be disturbed for a generation or two sadly in my case i have the dvd it will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time<SEP>0
i thought the movie was actually pretty good i enjoyed the acting and it moved along well the director seemed to really grasp the story he was trying to tell i have to see the big budget one coming out today obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very watchable when you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it there were some things that could of been better but most are budget related the acting was pretty good the fx and stunts were well done a couple of standouts were the guy who played the camera asst and the boy who played the child these kind of films have kept la working and this is one that turned out ok<SEP>1
really really bad slasher movie a psychotic person escapes from an asylum three years later he kills a sociology professor end of scene one semester yesterday later hey thats what the title card said a new sociology professor is at the school she makes friends with another female sociology professor who works there and starts dating another professor the students are all bored as are wethere are a number of title cards indicating how much time has passed scenes are pretty short and cut to different characters somewhere else making for little progression of any kind a lot of scenes involve characters walking and talking or sitting and talking and serve little purpose despite the passage of time many of the characters are always wearing the same clothing sometimes the unclear passage of time means when we see a body for the second time we ask ourselves: how long has that body been there and also at least one of the dead people dont seem to have been missed by othersthe killer manages to kill one person by stabbing her in the breast another by stabbing him in the crotch and another by slicing her forehead is his knife poisoned or somethingthe video box cover has a cheerleader: there arent any in the movie the rear cover has a photo of someone in a graduation cap and gown menacing a group of women in a dorm room the central redhead in the photo is in the movie but nobody ever wears such an outfit and there is no such scene the killer is strictly one-on-one<SEP>0
the drug years actually suffers from one of those aspects to mini-series or other kinds of tv documentaries run over and over again for a couple of weeks on tv its actually not long enough in a way all of the major bases in the decades are covered and theyre all interesting to note as views into post-modern history and from different sides but it almost doesnt cover enough or at least what is covered at times is given a once over when it could deserve more time for example the information and detail in part three about the whole process and business unto itself of shipping mass amounts of drugs partly the marijuana later cocaine is really well presented but there are more details that are kept at behest of how much time there is to coveroverall though the documentary does shed enough light on how drugs pop-culture government intervention the upper classes and lower classes and into suburbia all felt the wave of various drugs over the years and the interplay between all was very evident nobody in the film- except for the possibility of small hints with the pot- goes to endorse drugs outright but what is shown are those in archival clips about the honesty of what is at times fun and then tragic about taking certain drugs the appearances of various staunch ridiculously anti-drug officials does hammer some points down hard- with even in such an overview of the drug cultures and americas connection as a whole- as there is really only one major point that is made a couple of times by one of the interviewees the only way to really approach the issue of drugs is not just say no because as the war on drugs has shown it is not as effective as thought it is really just to come clean on all sides about all the drugs and the people who may be hypocritical about them as for example oxycontin continues on in the marketplaceis it with the great interest and depth of a ken burns documentary no but for some summertime tv viewing for the young ie my age who will view a lot of this as almost ancient history despite most of it being no more than a generation ago as well as for the old who can reflect some decades later about the great peaks careless times and then the disillusionment prodded more by the same media that years earlier propagated and advertised it there are those who might find the documentary to be particularly biased which is not totally untrue but it does attempt to get enough different takes on the social political and entertainment conditions of drugs interweaving for better or obvious worse for enough of a fascinating view<SEP>1
i find it hard to understand why this piece of utter trash was repackaged the only saving grace in the whole thing is the body of ariauna in her sexy uniform her humour is also to be appreciated she is a definite plus but alas it would take a magician to salvage this garbage however she must be positively recognised for her heroic effort & true professionalism cant say the same for her co star lilith with her whining voice that grates on your nervous system appeared disinterested & gave the impression that just her presence on the set was all that was needed all said apart from ariaunas performance it is indeed utter trash<SEP>0
hi everyone my names larissa im 13 years old when i was about 4 years old i watch curly sue and it knocked my socks of i have been watching that movie for a long time in fact about 30 minutes ago i just got done watching it alisan porter is a really good actor and i love that movie its so funny when she is dealing the cards every time i watch that movie at the end of it i cry its so said i know im only 13 years old but its such a touching story its really weird thats alisan is 25 years old now every time i watch a movie someone is always young and the movie comes out like a year after they make it and when u watch it and find out how old the person in the movie really is u wounder how they can go from one age to the next like harry potter that movie was also great but still daniel was about 12 years old in the first movie and i was about 11 so how could he go from 12 to 16 in about 4 years and im only 13 im not sure if he is 16 right now i think he is almost 18 but thats kind of weird when u look at one movie and on the next there about 4 years old then u when they were only 1 in the lastim not sure i have a big imagination and i like to revile iti am kind of a computer person but i like to do a lot of kids things also i am very smart like curly sue in the movie but one thing i dont like in the movie is when that guy calls the foster home and makes curly sue get taken away i would kill that guy if he really had done it in real life well im going to stop writing i know a write a lot sometimes but kids do have a lot in there head that need to get out and if they dont kids will never get to learnlarissa<SEP>1
problem child is one of the goofiest movies ever made its not the worst though some people will disagree with me on that but its not the best either its about a devilish 7-year-old boy who wrecks comic havoc on a childless couple john ritter amy yasbeck who foolishly adopts him this film is too silly and unbelievable because i dont buy for one second that a child could act as unrurly as the kid does in this film its asinine and preposterous although i did laugh several times throughout i really dont know why but i cant recommend this film i know im being too kind to it if there is one positive thing about problem child is that its better than the sequel which was just awful ** out of four<SEP>0
this movie was made for fans of dani and cradle of filth i am not one of them i think hes just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon still im generally not a fan of black metal but as i was carrying this dvd case to pay for it i convinced myself that the less authentic something is the more it tries to be convincing thus i assumed im in for a roller-coaster ride of rubber gore and do-it-yourself splatter with a sinister background now that is what i do likei got home and popped it in my patience lasted 15 minutes awful camera work and disgusting quality and that was then 2002 that it looked like it was shot using a hi8 camcorder i left it on the shelf maybe a nice evening with beer and bmovies would create a nice setting for this picture after a couple of months i got back to it in mentioned surroundings and saw half then not only the mentioned aspects annoyed me my disliking evolved i noticed how funny dani 165m; 55 height looked in his platform shoes ripping a head of a mugger apart yes ripping his head apparently had no skull i also found that this movie may have no sense still i havent finished it yet so i wasnt positiveafter a couple more tries i finally managed to finish this flick - a couple of months back yes it took me 55 years so - dani in fact was funny as satanmansonsuper-evil-mans helper and the movie did not make sense see our bad person employs dani to do bad things he delivers why well i guess hes just very very bad as a matter of fact they both are and that is pretty much itwe have a couple of short stories joined by danis character my favourite was about a guy who steals someones leg because he wants to use it as his own yeah exactly the actings rock bottom the cgi is the worst ever i mean stinger beats it and boy is stingers cgi baaaaad the story has no sense and the quality is lets just say it is not satisfying the only thing that might keep you watching is the unmotivated violence and gore blood and guts are made pretty well why you can actually see that the movie originated there and then moved on example - dani the man filth takes a stuffed cat - fake as can be - and guts it and then eats what fell out why we never know we do know however that this cat must have been on illegal substances as his heart is almost half his sizeyou might think after my comment that this movie is so bad its good but its just bad cradle of filth fans can add 3 points i added one for gore<SEP>0

i show this film to university students in speech and media law because its lessons are timeless: why speaking out against injustice is important and can bring about the changes sought by the oppressed why freedom of the press and freedom of speech are essential to democracy this is a must-see story of how apartheid was brought to the attention of the world through the activism of steven biko and the journalism of donald woods it also gives an important lesson of free speech: you can blow out a candle but you cant blow out a fire once the flame begins to catch the wind will blow it higher from biko by peter gabriel on shaking the tree<SEP>1
when rodney dangerfield is on a roll hes hilarious in my 5 wives hes not on a roll the timing of the one-liners is off but theyre the best thing going for the movie the five women who play the wives dont add up to one whole actress between them the plot is very weak even the premise is pretty weak; there are a few jokes about having multiple wives but the situation has little to do with anything else in the movie most of the movie could play the same way even if rodneys character had only one wife so the premise seems more like an old mans fantasy than a key part of the comedy another old mans fantasy: were supposed to accept that rodneys character is an athletic skierjerry stiller seems to be phoning in his role just to do a buddy a favor and the rest of the name actors must simply be desperate for workthe odd nods to political correctness later in the movie dont really do anything for the movie for those who like their movies politically correct the non-pc humor is still there in the first place and the seeming apologies for it still dont get the point for those who hate seeing a movie cave in to political correctness the pc add-ins are just annoying digressionsthis has to be the mildest r-rated movie ive ever seen there are some racy jokes and the bedroom scenes would have made shocking tv 40 years ago but thats about it maybe it was the topless men kiddingthe dvd features interviews where the cast members seem to find depth and importance in this movie and in their roles i kept wondering if they were serious or kidding they seem to be serious but i kept thinking they must be kidding! theres also a peculiar disclaimer suggesting that since the movie never actually names the mormons or the church of latter-day saints that somehow its not about them never mind that the movie features a polygamous religion in utah and makes reference to brigham youngin short my 5 wives was a disappointment i was hoping for rodney on a roll but the best i can say for the movie is that rodney was looking pretty good for a guy who was pushing 80 at the time<SEP>0
i can hardly believe that this inert turgid and badly staged film is by a filmmaker whose other works ive quite enjoyed the experience of enduring the lady and the duke and no other word but enduring will do left me in a vile mood a condition relieved only by reading the imdb user comment by ali-112 for not only has rohmer attempted with success to make us see the world through the genre art of 18th century france but as ali has pointed out has shown at the cost of alienating his audience the effects of both class consciousness and the revolution it inspired through the eyes of a dislikably elitist woman of her times the director has accomplished something undeniably difficult but i question whether it was worth the effort it took for him to do so -- or for us to watch the dull results of his labor<SEP>0
if there was anything akira kurosawa did wrong in making dodeska-den it was making it with the partnership he formed with the four knights the other three being kobayaski ichikawa and konishita they wanted a big blockbuster hit to kick off their partnership and instead kurosawa arguably the head cheese of the group delivered an abstract humanist art film with characters living in a decimated slum that had many of its characters face dark tragedies had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows but it was because of this among some other financial and creative woes that also contributed to his suicide attempt in 1971 and yet at the end of the day as an artist kurosawa didnt stop delivering what hes infamous for with his dramas: the strengths of the human spirit in the face of adversity that its backdrop is a little more unusual than most shouldnt be ignored but its not at all a fault of kurosawasthe material in dodeska-den is absorbing but not in ways that one usually finds from the director and mostly because it is driven by character instead of plot theres things that happen to these people and kurosawas challenge here is to interweave them into a cohesive whole the character who starts off in the picture oddly enough though thankfully as theres not much room for him to grow is rokkuchan a brain damaged man-child who goes around all day making train sounds the clickety-clack of the title only sometimes stopping to pray for his mother but then we branch off: theres the father and son the latter who scrounges restaurants for food and the former who goes on and on with site-specific descriptions of his dream house; an older man has the look of death to him and we learn later on hes lost a lot more than hell tell most people including a woman who has a past with him; a shy quiet woman who works in servitude to her adoptive father or uncle im not sure who rapes her; and a meek guy in a suit who has a constant facial tick and a big mean wife- to those who are social aroundthere are also little markers of people around these characters like two drunks who keep stumbling around every night like clockwork putting big demands on their spouses sometimes unintentionally swapping them! and theres the kind sake salesman on the bike who has a sweet but strange connection with the shy quiet woman and of course theres a group of gossiping ladies who squat around a watering hole in the middle of the slum not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless its about something erotic with a guy first to note with all of this is how kurosawa sets the picture; its a little post-apocalyptic looking not of any particular time or place that is until in a couple of shots we see modern cars and streets its a marginalized society but the concerns of these people are however in tragic scope meant to be deconstructed through dramatic force like bergman kurosawa is out to dissect the shattered emotions of people with one scene in particular when the deathly-looking man who has hollow sorrowful eyes sits ripping cloth in silence as a woman goes along with itsometimes theres charm and even some laughs to be had with these people i even enjoyed maybe ironically the little moments with rokkuchan specifically with kurosawas cameo as a painter in the street or the awkward silences with the man with the facial tics but while kurosawa allows his actors some room to improvise his camera movements still remain as theyve always been- patient but alert with wide compositions and claustrophobic shots painterly visions and faces sometimes with the stylization of a silent drama meant as a weeper amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories with some of them ie the father and son in the car especially sad kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme as his first one in eastmancolor like its one of his paintings lush sprawling spilling at times over the seams but always with some control this place is not necessarily lighter; its like the abstract has come full-throttle into the scene where things look vibrant but are much darker underneath its a brilliant tricky double-edged sword that allows for the dream-like intonations with such heavy duty dramawith a sweet movie score toru takemitsu also responsible for ran and some excellent performances from the actors and a few indelible scenes in a whole fantastic career dodeska-den is in its own way a minor work from the director but nonetheless near perfect on its own terms which as with many kurosawa dramas like ikiru and red beard holds hard truths on the human condition without too much sentimentality<SEP>1
this movie is just bad bad bad bad now that ive gotten that out of the way i feel better this movie is poor from beginning to end the story is lame the 3-d segment is really bad freddy is at his cartoon character worst thank god they killed him off and who wants to see roseanne and tom arnold cameosthe only good thing in the movie is the little bit of backstory that were given on freddy we see he once had a family and we get to see his abusive alcoholic father alice cooperother than that all bad there are some quality actors in here lisa zane and yaphet kotto and they do their best but the end result is just so bad the hour and a half i spent watching this movie is and hour and half i cant ever get back<SEP>0
i give this movie a one for it is truly an awful movie sound track of the dvd is so bad it actually hurts my ear but the vision no matter how disjointed does show something really fancy in the italian society i will not go into detail what actually was so shocking but the various incidents are absolutely abnormal so for the kink value i give it oneotherwise the video photography acting of the adults actors actresses are simply substandard a practical jock to people who love foreign moviesroberto the main character has full spectrum of emotions but exaggerated to the point of being unbelievablehowever the children in the movie are mostly 34 years old and they are genuine and the movie provides glimpse of the italian life<SEP>0
i went to a prescreening of this film and was shocked how cheesy it was it was a combination of every horrorthriller cliché trying to comment on many things including pedophilia satan worship undercover cops affairs religion and it was a mess the acting was pretty washboard; the kid and the jesus dude were alright but apart from them anyways i admire the effort though slightly failed on the attempt at showing the christian people in a different wayeven though they did that the way it presented the gospel was a bit stock and kiddish but then again it may have to be since he was talking to a little kid no actually ive decided its just all around bad music oh my gosh horrible toooo over-dramatic okay i felt bad for the people who made this movie at the premier; it seemed like a poor student project im going to stop ranting about this now and say bottom line go see this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your life on crap there you go<SEP>0
im not usually one to slate a film i try to see the good points and not focus on the bad ones but in this case there are almost no good points in my opinion if youre going to make something that bad why bother part of the film is take up with shots of annes face while she breaths deeply and violin music plays in the background the other part is filled with poor and wooden acting rupert penry jones is expressionless jennifer higham plays annes younger sister with modern mannerisms anne is portrayed as being meek and self effacing which is fine at the beginning but she stays the same all through the film and you see no reason for captain wentworth to fall in love with her overall the production lacks any sense of period with too many mistakes to be overlooked such as running out of the concert kissing in the street running about in the streets with no hat on why was this scene in the film at all the scene in the book was one of the most romantic scenes written to sum it up a terrible film very disappointing<SEP>0
lorenzo lamas stars as jack `solider` kelly an ex-vietnam vet and a renegade cop who goes on a search and destroy mission to save his sister from backwoods rednecks atrocious movie is so cheaply made and so bad that ron palillo is third billed and yet has 3 minutes of screen time and even those arent any good overall a terrible movie but the scenes with lorenzo lamas and josie bell hanging from a tree bagged and gagged are worth a few unintentional laughs followed by an improved sequel<SEP>0
how sheep-like the movie going public so often proves to be as soon as a few critics say something new is good ie - shake-cam everyone jumps on the bandwagon as if they are devoid of independent thought this was not a good movie it was a dreadful movie 1 plot - what plot bourne was chased from here to there from beginning to end thats the plot dont look for anything deeper than this 2 cinematography - do me a favor! any 7 year old armed with an old and battered 8mm movie camera would do a far better job i am not exaggerating here this film is a tour-de-force of astonishingly amateurish camera-work the ridiculous shaking of every i really do mean every scene will cause dizziness and nausea 3 believable - oh yes definitely this is a masterpiece of credibility i loved scenes about bourne being chased by local police through the winding market streets of tangier - ive been to tangier even the guides cant navigate their way through those streets but bourne shook off 100 police with speed and finesse greengrass must be laughing his head off at the gullibility of his film disciples 4 editing - i dont know what the editor was on when he did this film but i want some! - every scene is between 05 and 2 seconds i felt nauseous at the end of the film from the strobe effect of the scenes flashing by 5 directing - hmmm this is an interesting aspect the film appears to have actually not had any directing more a case of greengrass throwing a copy of the script all two pages at the cameramen and told to shoot a few scenes whilst drunk - dont worry boys well tie the scenes together in the editing room the editor should be tarred feathered and put in the stocks for allowing this monstrosity to hit the silver screen 6 not one but two senior cia operatives giving the tender feminine treatment to the mistreated and misunderstood jason bourne - putting their lives on the line for someone they couldnt even be sure wasnt a traitor talk about stupid nincompoops whilst the evil male cia members plot to terminate any operative who so much as drops a paper-clip on the floor well all men are evil arent they - except for snags of course yes this really is a modern and politically correct film that shows the females to be the heroes of the day and the oppressive males as the real threat to humanity 7 when the you-know-what finally hits the fan good triumphs over evil just like it always does eh and the would-be assassin gets the drop on jason bourne - he suddenly undergoes a guilt trip and refrains from pulling the trigger yeah - right - at that very moment the evil deputy director just happens to turn up - gun in hand and he does pull the trigger - how did this 60 year old man run so fast and not even be out of breath wonders will never cease 8 dont worry theres a senate hearing and the baddies get pulled up before the courts well we cant have nasty politically incorrect cia operatives going round shooting people can we how lovely to see a true to life pc film of the noughties -------------the bourne ultimatum is utter rubbish<SEP>0
if you were ever sad for not being able to get a movie on dvd it was probably delirious you were looking for how often do you laugh when watching stand up comedy routines i was too young to see richard pryor during his greatest time and when i was old enough to see eddie murphys delirious and raw not as funny i never knew where eddie got a big part of his inspiration now that im older and have seen both pryor and many of the comedians after murphy i realize two things: everybody steals from eddie while eddie lovingly borrowed from richard thats the huge difference: eddie was original funny provocative thoughtful  and more he was something never before seen he was all we ever needed these days eddie murphy is boring and old  but once upon a time he was the king and delirious was the greatest castle ever built truly one of the funniest routines of all time<SEP>1
stargate sg-1 is a spin off of sorts from the 1994 movie stargate i am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject the show gets it rolling from the very first episode a retired jack oneill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion dr daniel jackson through the first two episodes we meet samantha carter a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her and there is tealc a quiet compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team the main bad guys are called the gouald they are parasites who can get inserted into ones brain thus controlling them and doing evil deeds any gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a system lord the warriors behind the gouald are called jaffa who house the parasitic gouald in their bodies until the gouald can get inserted in a persons brainthrough the episodes we mostly get to see sg-1 the exploratory team comprised of jackdanieltealcand sam go through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets this device is called the stargate and they encounter new cultures or bad guys some episodes are on-world meaning that they do not go through the stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on earththrough the years you start to see a decline in the sg-1 team as close knit and more character-building story lines this in turn means even more on-world episodes which is perfectly understandablemy rating: 87510----while most of this show is good there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years but still top notch science fiction!<SEP>1
its not braveheart thankfullybut it is fine entertainment with engaging characters and good acting all around i enjoyed this film when it was released and upon viewing it again last weekfind it has held up well over time not a classic filmbut a very fine and watchable movie to enjoy as great entertainment<SEP>1
i know i know it was a good ending but sincerely it was awesome i love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time i was impressed with darth vader turning against the emperor i really stayed astonished the anguishing sequence in that film was when luke is tortured and defeated by the emperordarth sidious he is about to be destroyed when darth vader dark lord of the sith eliminates his dark master a nice sacrifice the cinematography of this film is impressive i was surprised with all the vessels of the rebel battle ships and all imperial war ships and super star destroyers i loved the new race they brought on screen the mon calomari the ewoks the sullesteian landos co pilot and many more most of my favorite scenes are in that film:1-when vader destroys the emperor and is fatally wounded 2- when luke sees the spirits of obi-wan and yoda and then it shows up anakin skywalker sebastian shawthe greatest scene in star wars 3- when leia slays jabba strangling the hutt crime lordi personally like the script and the battle of endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of star wars between darth vader vs luke skywalker on the death star post-script: the scenes with leia in the slave bikini are memorable 910<SEP>1
seems everyone in this film is channeling woody allen they stammer and pause and stammer some more only for really die-hard denero fans! it tries to appear as edgy and artistic - but it comes off as looking like a very very low budget film made by college students the most often used word in the whole film is hum the film does peg the atmosphere of the late sixtiesearly seventies though if you like films where people are constantly talking over each other horrible lighting even if it is for arts sake and makes you feel like you are sitting in on a lame political meeting then you might like this - but you need to be really bored i found this cd in the dollar bin and now i know why<SEP>0
dear god where do i begin this is bar none the best movie ive ever seen the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best why the script writers for this movie arent writing big budget films i will never understand another is the cast it is great this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure i know some of you out there are probably thinking no way he has plenty better but no your wrong raptor island is a work of art i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie crash with a bunch of no names and no raptors i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing ever<SEP>1
as alan rudolphs breakfast of champions slides into theaters with little fanfare and much derision it makes me think back to 1996 when keith gordons mother night came out now for all the talk of kurt vonnegut being unfilmable its surprising that he has gotten two superb cinematic treatments the other being slaughter-house five mother night is certainly one of the most underappreciated films of the decade and i cannot understand why its brilliant! it stays almost entirely faithful to vonneguts book without being stilted or overly literary and adds to it a poetry that is purely cinematic how many film adaptations of any authors work can claim that vonnegut himself even puts in a cameo appearance towards the end of the film and can you ask for a better endorsement than that not only is it a beautiful film it is a beautifully acted written and directed film and it is among my picks for the top five or so american films of the 1990s its a mournful inspired surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected i would sincerely encourage anyone to see mother night - it doesnt even take a familiarity with vonneguts work to fully appreciate it as slaughter-house five sometimes does it is a powerful affecting piece of cinema<SEP>1
roman polanski masterfully directs this sort of a variation on the same theme as repulsion i cant imagine there is one honest movie goer not able to acknowledge the fine director in le locataire yet both parts of the dyptic may not be thoroughly satisfactory to most people myself includedpolanski is very good at making us feels the inner torture of his characters deneuve in repulsion and himself in le locataire starting with some lack of self-assurance soon to turn gradually into psychological uneasiness eventually blossoming into an irreversible physical malaise the shared ordeal for the characters and audience is really dissimilar from the fright and tension of horror movies since theres no tangible supernatural element here while horror movies allow for some kind of catharsis be it cheap or more elaborate polanski sadistically tortures us and if in his latter opus the dark humour is permanent we are mostly on our nerves as opposed to on the edge of our seatssuspense horror all this is a matter of playing with the audiences expectations alternatively fooling and fulfilling them not literally with peoples nerves in my book rosemarys baby is a far greater achievement because sheer paranoia and plain rationality are in constant struggle: the story is about a couple moving in a strange flat while we are forced to identify with a sole character whats more if the fantasy elements are all in the heros mind the situation is most uncomfortable since we the viewers are compelled to judge him reject him while we have been masterfully lured paint n lure into being him<SEP>1
blonde and blonder was unfunnybasically it was a rip-off girl version of dumb and dumber but less funny and they used too much background noises and musicway too much background noises and music if you ask me!!!!it starts out immensely boring and totally inaneit doesnt pick up pace anywhere soon and i was feeling more frustrated as this nonsense carried onmaybe the only thing that saved me from giving this movie a 1 was the last 30 minutesi found it somewhat entertaining and interesting as it neared the end but that was the only partalso i couldnt help but like pamela anderson and denise richards characters a littleeven though this movie didnt get any laughs from me it kept my attentioni wouldnt say to completely avoid this movie but there are thousands of better films for you to spend your time and money on than blonde and blonder<SEP>0
in a series chock-full of brilliant episodes this one stands out as one of my very favorites its not the most profound episode theres no great meaning or message but its a lot of fun and there are some fine performancesbut what makes it really stand out for me is that it is to my knowledge the *only* twilight zone episode with a *double* snapper ending the zone is rightly famous for providing a big surprise at the end of a story but this time you get a surprise and think thats that but it turns out theres *another* surprise waiting i just like that so much that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes the other being a deeper more message-oriented one<SEP>1
heavenly days commits a serious comedy faux pas: its desperate to teach us a civics lesson and it wont stop until weve passed the final exam fibber mcgee and molly take a trip to washington where they see the senate in action or inaction if you prefer have a spat with their senator eugene palette in one of the worst roles of his career get acquainted with a gaggle of annoying stereotypical refugee children and meet a man on a train reading a book by henry wallace henry wallace!! a year later he was considered a near communist dupe but in 1944 he was a-ok add in some truly awful musical moments a whole lot of flagwaving hooey and a boring subplot about newspaper reporters and youve got a film that must have had philip wylie ready to pen generation of vipers 2: dc boogaloo drastically unfun heavenly days is another reminder that the devil has all the best tunes<SEP>0

i just got back from this free screening and this osama witch project is the hands-down worst film ive seen this year worse than even catwoman - which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fictionin september tapes a film crew of documentary journalists heads to afghanistan - despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip the conditions and oh yeah the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wifes death on sept 11 - to track down osama bin ladenthey made eight tapes on their journey which now document their travels and of course their attempts to kill the terrorist leader the eight tapes thankfully all end at points significant in the narrative which is convenient for a documentarythe psychotic idiotic protagonist - who is given to long significant speeches that he probably learned watching macgyver - cares nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew as he gets them further and further into danger through a series of completely dumb mishaps i dont know why he didnt just wear a sign on his back that said shoot methe crews translator supposedly their sensible voice-of-reason does little more than whine and gets baffled as the idiot hero leads them into doom you wish theyd brought along someone on their trip to call them all moronsaround tape 4 i began rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew<SEP>0
deliverance is one of the best exploitation films to come out of that wonderful 1970s decade from whence so many other exploitation films camea group of friends sets out on a canoe trip down a river in the south and they become victimized by a bunch of toothless hillbillies who pretty much try to ruin their lives its awesomewe are treated to anal rape vicious beatings bow and arrow killings shootings broken bones etc a lot like 1974s texas chainsaw massacre to say that deliverance is believable would be immature this would never and could never happen even in the dark ages of 1972deliverance is a very entertaining ride and packed full of action it is one in a huge pile of exploitation films to come from the early 70s and it arguably sits on top of that pile with its great acting superb cinematography and excellent writing8 out of 10 kids<SEP>1
well well well as good as john carpenters season 1 outing in masters of horror was this is the complete opposite he certainly proved he was still a master of horror with cigarette burns but pro-life is perhaps the worst i have seen from himits stupid totally devoid of creepy atmosphere and tension and it overstays its welcome despite the less-than-an-hour running time the script is nonsense the characters are irritable and un-appealing and the conclusion is beyond absurdand for those suckers who actually bought the dvd one of them being me; did you see how carpenter describes the film hes actually proud of it and he talks about it as his best work for a long time and he praises the script and in the commentary track where he notices an obvious screw up that made it to the final cut he just says he didnt feel it essential to rectify the mistake and he just let it be there i fear the old master has completely lost his touch i sincerely hope im proved wrongi want to leave on a positive note and mention that the creature effects are awesome though technically speaking this film is top notch with effective lighting schemes and make up effects<SEP>0
i wonder who how and more importantly why the decision to call richard attenborough to direct the most singular sensation to hit broadway in many many years hes an academy award winning director yes he won for ghandi you moron! jeremy irons is an academy winning actor do you want to see him play rocky balboa he has experience with musicals really oh what a lovely war have you forgotten to answer your question yes! the film is a disappointment clear and simple not an ounce of the live energy survived the heavy handedness of the proceedings every character danced beautifully they were charming but their projection was theatrical i felt nothing but when i saw it on stage i felt everything the film should have been cast with stars unknown newcomers but stars with compelling unforgettable faces even the most invisible of the group great actors who could dance beautifully well michael douglas was in it true i forgot im absolutely wrong and you are absolutely right nothing like a richard attenborough michael douglas musical<SEP>0
my flatmate rented out this film the other night so we watched it togetherthe first impression is actually a positive one because the whole movie is shot in this colorful grainy post-mtv texture fast sequences cool angles sweeping camera moves - for the moment there you feel like you about to watch another snatch for the momentwhen the plot actually starts unfolding one starts to feel as if one over-dosed amphetamine things just dont make sense anymore i would hate to spoil the fun of watching it by giving out certain scenes but then again the film is so bad that you are actually better off not watching itfirst you think it is a crime story recounted in a conversation between keira knightley and lucy liu wrong this conversation provides no coherent narrative whatsoever rather on the contrary dominos lesbian come on on lucy lius character during the second part of the movie just throws the audience into further confusionthen i thought that maybe it is a movie about a girl from affluent but dysfunctional background who grew to be a tough bounty hunter in any case that is the message conveyed by the opening scenes but after that the question of dominos character is entirely lost to the criminal plot so in short no this is not a movie about dominos characterthen i thought its probably a story of one robbery a pretty bloody robbery 10 millions went missing bounty hunters are chasing around suspected robbers mafia kids are executed hands are removed domino tries to crack why this time they get no bounty certificates etc but soon this impression is dispelled by another u-turn of the plotthis time we are confronted with a sad story of an obese afro-american woman who fakes drivers licenses at the local mvd and at the age of 28 happens to be a youngest grandmother lateesha stars on jerry springer show tries to publicize some new wacky racial theory and at the same time struggles to find money for her sick granddaughterwhat does this have to do with the main plot urgh well nobody knows except that director had to explain the audiences where will bounty hunters put their collectors fee of 300000then at some point you start to think: oh it is about our society and the way media distorts things there is reality tv crew driving around with the bounty hunters and doing some violent footage the bounty hunters are also stuck with a bunch of hollywood actors who just whine all the time about having their noses broken and themselves dragged around too many crime scenes but no this is not a movie about media they just appear sporadically throughout the movieplus there are numerous other sub-plots: the crazy afghani guy bent on liberating afghanistan the love story between domino and chocco the mescaline episode the fbi surveillance operationcan all of the things mentioned above be packed into 2 hrs movie judge for yourself but my conclusion is clear - it is a veritable mess!<SEP>0
pam grier stars as coffy shes a nurse who seeks revenge on the drug dealers who got her sister hooked on bad heroine like any 70s blaxploitation flick you can expect to see the racist bad guys get their just desserts there were scores of these films made during the 70s and they were really demeaning to both black and white audiences alike this is mainly due to the vicious racial hostility in these films and the degrading stereotypical characters especially the female characters other common threads between coffy and other films of its type include brutal violence corrupt cops car chases a generous abundance of nudity and sex-crazed gorgeous women not to mention urban ghettos populated by drug-dealers pimps mobsters and other criminal scumpam grier was the undisputed queen of 70s blaxploitation heroines she was magnificent being both tough-as-nails and drop-dead gorgeous like in her other films pam outshines the other characters in coffy in fact pam is so charismatic on screen that these sorts of films are unwatchable without her as the main character if you like pam grier youre better off seeing her other films like foxy brown or perhaps friday foster these films have much less empty sleaze than coffy does pams character in coffy degrades herself way too much to get the bad guys pams characters in her other blaxploitation films dont stoop as low to get revenge as coffy did id say only watch coffy if youre unable to see any of pam griers other films otherwise coffy is a waste of time only pams talent as an actress makes viewing coffy bearable<SEP>0
i do not recommend this movie because its inaccurate and misleading this story was supposed to be in algerian berber territory this one was shot in the southern tunisian desert completetly different culture i know i am from both tunisia and algeria the other shocking element was the character of her companion aunt speaks in the movie with a very eloquent french university level academic french while the character she plays was supposed to be of a disturbed never left her mountain kind of personage so living as a bedouin with that kind of education i that context is impossible the most disgraceful scene and disrespectful especially for the people of the region is the femme repudiee segment which is s pure invention from the writerdirector things like that will never happen in a algerian society ever!!!<SEP>0
en route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway a female reporter runs into a strange hitch-hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination the strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area: in the first story an adulterous couple plot to kill the womans husband but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie; and in the second story a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed onthe zombie chronicles is an attempt by writer garrett clancy and director brad sykes at making a zombie themed anthologya nice idea but with only two stories it falls woefully short and thats not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver: the acting is lousy with joe haggerty as the tale-telling ebenezer jackson giving one of the strangest performances i have ever seen; the locations are uninspired; the script is dreary; theres a sex scene with zero nudity; and the ending well that beggars beliefto be fair some of sykes creative camera-work is effective although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused and joe castros cheapo gore is enthusiastic: an ear is bitten off eyeballs are plucked out a face is removed brains are squished and there is a messy decapitation these positives just about make the film bearable but be warned the zombie chronicles aint a stroll in the park even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trashi give the zombie chronicles 210 but generously raise my rating to 3 since i didnt get to view the film with the benefit of 3d although i have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldnt have made that much of a difference<SEP>0
its 1982 two years after the iranian embassy siege which involved the dramatic sas rescue from the balconys and with a war with argentina over the falkland islands currently taking place what better film to make than a gung-ho sas film that re-creates the iranian hostage siege whilst using britains number one action hero of the day lewis collins throw in edward woodward and a few other well known actors and youve got a winner on your handswell maybe not! the film itself doesnt make the situation serious enough whilst the acting is quite second rate its like a movie long episode of the professionals but without the formula this film goes nowhere fast and is quite predictable maybe cubby brocoli watched this film and decided to ditch lewis collins as a touted james bond replacement for roger moore watch it if your a fan of lewis collins or sas stuff in general if not save your time<SEP>0
what do i say about such an absolutely beautiful film i saw this at the atlanta georgia dragoncon considering that this is my main town i am very much a sci-fi aficionado and enjoy action type films i happened to be up all night and was about ready to call it a day when i noticed this film playing in the morning this is not a sci-fi nor action film of any sort let me just start out by saying that i am not a fan of witchblade nor of eric etebari having watched a few episodeshis performance in that seemed stale and robotic but he managed to really win me over in this performance i mean really win me over having seen cellular i did not think there was much in the way of acting for this guy but his performance as kasadya was simply amazing he was exceedingly convincing as the evil demon but there was so much in depth detail to this character it absolutely amazed me i later looked it up online and found that eric won the best actor award which is well deserved considering its the best of his career and gained my respect now i keep reading about the fx of this and production of this project and let me just say that i did not pay attention to them sorry brian they were very nicely done but i was even more impressed with the story - which i think was even more his goalseeing films like godzilla with huge effects just really turned me off i could not sleep after this film thinking it over and over again in my head the situation of an abusive family is never an easy one i showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her so having lived with abuse this is one film that i think about constantly and would highly recommend<SEP>1
this has to be creepiest most twisted holiday film that ive ever clapped eyes on and thats saying something i know that the mexican people have some odd ideas about religion mixing up ancient aztec beliefs with traditional christian theology but their day of the dead isnt half as scary as their take on santa claussosanta isnt some jolly fat red-suited alcoholictake a look at those rosy cheeks sometime! rather hes a skinny sociopathic pedophile living in heavenor the heavens whichever with a bunch of kids who work harder than the ones in kathy lee giffords sweat shops they sing oh-so-cute traditional songs of their homelands while wearing clothing so stereotypical that i was surprised there wasnt a little african-american boy in black face singing mammy this santa is a peeping tom pervert who watches and listens to everything that everybody does from his eye in the sky this is so he can tell whos been naughty or nicewith an emphasis on those who are naughty id bettheres no mrs claus no elveswhat does he need elves for when hes got child labor and the reindeer are mechanical wind-up toys! this floating freak show hovers on a cloud presumably held up by its silver liningsantas nemesis isthe devil! what is this santa our lord and savior weird anyhoo satan sends one of his minions a mincing prancing devil named pitch to try to screw up christmas let me get this straight-the forces of purest evil are trying to ruin a completely commercial and greed driven holiday seems kind of redundant doesnt itpitch is totally ineffectual he tries to talk some children into being bad but doesnt have much luck i was strongly struck by the storyline of the saintly little girl lupe whos family is very poor all that she wants is a doll for christmas but he parents cant afford to buy her onethey spent all of their money on the cardboard that they built their house out of so pitch tries to encourage her to steal a doll in reality thats the only way that a girl that poor would ever get a doll because being saintly and praying to god and holy santa doesnt really work but lupe resists temptation and tells pitch to get thee behind her and so is rewarded by being given a doll so creepy looking that you just know that its chuckys sisteralong the way pitch manages to get santa stuck in a treeuh-huh from whence hes rescued by merlin! merlin you have got to be kidding me! since when do mythical druidic figures appear in christmas tales or have anything to do with a christian religion and doesnt god disapprove of magic theyd have been burning merlin at the stake a few hundred years ago not asking him to come to the rescue of one of gods aspectsor thats what i assume santa must be to be going up against satan this movie is one long huh from start to finish and itll make you wonder if that eggnog you drank wasnt spiked or something probably it was since this movie is like one long giant dt<SEP>0
shakespeare behind bars was the most surprising and delightful film ive seen all year its about a prison program somewhere in california if i recall correctly where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years the film follows their production of the tempest from casting through performance and in the process we learn some pretty amazing things about these men who are all in for the most serious of crimes truth is indeed stranger than fiction -- if anyone tried to adapt this story into a fiction film the audience would never buy it but knowing that its real makes it breathtaking to watch -- literally; i gasped out loud when i learned of one particularly gifted felons crime its like some loopy episode of oz and all the more entertaining because the characters and their bizarre stories are real<SEP>1
this isnt the comedic robin williams nor is it the quirkyinsane robin williams of recent thriller fame this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over-dramatization mixed with robins new love of the thriller but this isnt a thriller per se this is more a mysterysuspense vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeperalso starring sandra oh and rory culkin this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report until williams character gets close to achieving his goali must say that i was highly entertained though this movie fails to teach guide inspect or amuse it felt more like i was watching a guy williams as he was actually performing the actions from a third person perspective in other words it felt real and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the storyall in all its worth a watch though its definitely not fridaysaturday night fareit rates a 7710 fromthe fiend :<SEP>1
an american in paris is a showcase of gene kelly watch as gene sings acts and dances his way through paris in any number of situations some purely majestic others pure corn one can imagine just what kelly was made of as he made this film only a year before singin in the rain he is definately one of the all time greats it is interesting to look at the parallels between the two films especially in kellys characters the only main difference being that one is based in paris the other in lasome have said that leslie carons acting was less than pure perhaps cyd charisse who was originally intended for the role could have done better however caron is quite believable in the role and has chemistry with kelly oscar levants short role in this film gave it just what it needed someone who doesnt look like gene kelly filling the role as the everyman isnt an easy task yet levant did it with as much class as any other leadthe song and dance routines are all perfection even the overlong ballet at the end of the film makes it a better film with it than without seeing that there really wasnt much screen time to make such a loving relationship believable minnelli used this sequence to make it seem as if youd spent four hours with them ingenious!i would have to rate this film up with singin since it is very similar in story and song singin would barely get the nod because of debbie reynolds uplifting performancefull recommendation810 stars<SEP>1
well chuck jones is dead lets soil his characters by adding cheap explosions an american drawn anime knock off style and give them superpowers but sir dont we all ready have several shows in the works that are already like this much less dont dump all over their original creators dreams yes! and those shows make us a bunch of cash and we need more! but wont every man women and child who grew up with these time less characters be annoyed hay youre right! set it in the future make them all descendents of the original characters and change all the names slightlybut not too much though we still need to be able to milk the success of the classicswell thats the only reason i can think of why this even exists if you look past the horrible desecration of our beloved looney toons then it looks like an ok show but then there is already the teen titans which is the same bloody thing all the characters are dressed like batman they drive around in some sort of ship fighting super villains they have superpowers only difference is they sort of talk like the looney tunes and have similar names and character traitsthis kind of thing falls into the its so ridiculous its good kind of category think of the super mario brothers movie and batman and robin if you want to laugh for all the wrong reasons check this out if you are of the younger generation what this thing is actually intended for and can look pass the greedy executives shamelessness then run with it and enjoyif you enjoy this cartoon i dont have a problem with you its the people who calculated this thing together that i am mad at you know how they say piracy is like stealing a car; this show is like grave robbing they might as well of dug up all the people involved with the original cartoon shoved them on a display dressed them up in err pirate costumes and charged money if this show wasnt using characters ones that didnt resemble the looney toons in anyway whatsoever that have already made the studios millions then this would be fine but no! for shame warner brothers for shameif i saw this thing as a 30 second gag on an episode of the simpsons or family guy i would love it as it is i just cant believe this was ever made i would bet anyone that 80% of the people who work on this show hate it but whatever it doesnt really matter in 10 years this show will have been forgotten while the originals will live on forever or at least until the world endscoming 2008 snoopy and the peanut gang are back and now they have freaking lasers and can turn invisible! can charley brown defeat the evil alien warlord zapar tune in and see<SEP>0
domestic import was a great movie i laughed the whole time it was funny on so many levels from the crazy outfits to the hilarious situations the acting was great alla korot larry dorf howard hesseman and all the others did an awesome job because it is an independent film written by a first-time writer it doesnt have the clichés that are expected of other comedies which was such a relief it was a unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the heart-warming story i heard it was based on a true story if so then that is hilarious and amazing! i highly recommend this movie<SEP>1

anyone who knows me even remotely can tell you that i love bad movies almost as much as i love great ones and i can honestly say that i have finally seen one of the all-time legendary bad movies: the almost indescribable mess that is myra breckinridge an adaptation of gore vidals best-selling book he later disowned this film version the star-studded myra breckinridge is truly a movie so bad that it remains bizarrely entertaining from beginning to end the x-rated movie about sex change operations and hollywood was an absolute catastrophe at the box office and was literally booed off the screen by both critics and audiences at the time of its release not surprisingly the film went on to gain a near-legendary cult status among lovers of bad cinema and i was actually quite excited to finally see for the first timedirector michael sarne who only had two other previous directing credits to his name at the time took a lot of flack for the finished film and in honesty it really does not look like he had a clue about what he was trying to achieve the film is often incoherent with entire sequences edited together in such a half-hazzard manner that many scenes become nearly incomprehensible also irritating is the gimmick of using archival footage from the fox film vaults and splicing it into the picture at regular intervals this means that there is archival footage of past film stars such as judy garland and shirley temple laced into newly-film scenes of often lewd sexual acts and the process just doesnt work as intended this also caused a minor uproar as actors such as temple and loretta young sued the studio for using their image without permissionperhaps sarne is not the only one to blame however as the films screenplay and casting will also make many viewers shake their heads in disbelief for instance this film will ask you to believe that the scrawny film critic rex reed in his first and last major film role could have a sex change operation and emerge as the gorgeous sex goddess raquel welch! the film becomes further hard to follow when welch as myra attempts to take over a film school from her sleazy uncle played by legendary film director john huston seduce a nubile female film student farrah fawcett and teach the schools resident bad boy roger herren a lesson by raping him with a strap-on dildo did everyone follow that and it gets even better or worse depending upon your perspective! i have yet to mention the films top-billed star: the legendary screen sex symbol of the nineteen-thirties mae west! ms west was 77 year old when she appeared in this film she had been retired for 26 years and apparently she still considered herself to be a formidable sex symbol as she plays an upscale talent agent who has hunky men including a young tom selleck throwing themselves at her as if this werent bad enough the tone-deaf west actually performs two newly-written songs about halfway through the film and i think that i might have endured permanent brain damage from listening to them! naturally none of this even closely resembles anything that any person of reasonable taste would describe as good but i would give myra breckinridge a 4 out of 10 because it was always morbidly entertaining even when i had no idea what in the hell was supposed to be going on also most of the cast tries really hard raquel in particular appears so hell-bent in turning her poorly-written part into something meaningful that she single-handedly succeeds in making the movie worth watching if she had only been working with a decent screenplay and capable director then she might have finally received some respect form criticsthe rest of the cast is also fine the endearingly over-the-top john huston who really should have been directing the picture has some funny moments rex reed isnt bad for a non-actor and farrah fawcett is pleasantly fresh-faced and likable roger herren is also fine but he never appeared in another movie again after this i guess he just couldnt live down being the guy who was rapped by raquel welch and as anyone could guess from the description above mae west was totally out of her mind when she agreed to do this movie - but thats part of what makes it fun for those of us who love bad cinema<SEP>0
if in the 90s youre adapting a book written in the 50s set the bloody thing in the 50s and not the 90s see 40 year old mores and values tend not to play as well or ring as true that far down the road its a simple rule that hollywood habitually keeps violating and thats the problem with this film it should have been set in the era it was written in youd think that would be a no-brainer but nooo id elaborate but bmacvs comment spells it out quite well ill limit my commentary to rachel ward she looks like she dieted her ass completely out of existence for this role as a result she looks like a crack ho on chemotherapy and is about as sexy as a gay leather couch in drag i found her i could die at any moment look quite disconcerting and it greatly detracted from her supposed hotness and the sexual tension the film intended to create other than that the film was quite good; a 7+ out of 10<SEP>1
well no i tell a lie this is in fact not the best movie of all time but it is a really enjoyable movie that nobody i know has seenits a buddy cop movie starring jay leno and pat moritamr miyagi with some fluff story about a missing car engine prototype or something but that doesnt matter the reason this movie is fun is because of the interaction between the two leads who initially dislike and distrust each other but in a shocking twist of fate end up becoming friends the whole culture difference thing is done quite wellin that its fun to watch its completely ridiculous but in a cheesy and enjoyable kind of way the soundtrack is coolonce again in a cheesy 80s kind of way it suits the movie ive been trying to find one of the songs for ages but as im working from memory of what i think a few of the words were i cant seem to find itanother thing this movie has is the most fantastic pay off of any movie ever but i wont give that one away oh no! in conclusion id take this movie over 48 hoursmost of eddie murphys output including beverly hills cop and whatever buddy junk jackie chan or martin lawrence have to their names if youre looking for a buddy cop movie and are getting fed up with straight white cop meets zany streetwise black cop give this a shot you might be pleasantly surprised cos this turns the whole formula upside down with straight japanese cop meets zany streetwise white copim giving this 7 to be honest i like it more than that id rather watch this than a lot of stuff id give 8 but i guess i know deep down that its some sort of insanity that makes me like this movie<SEP>1
snow white which just came out in locarno where i had the chance to see it of course refers to the world famous fairy tale and it also refers to coke in the end real snow of the swiss alps plays its part as wellthus all three aspects of the title are addressed in this film there is a lot of dope on scene and there is also a pale dark haired girl - with a prince who has to go through all kind of trouble to come to her rescuebut: its not a fairy tale its supposed to be a realistic drama located in zurich switzerland according to the taglinetechnically the movie is close to perfect unfortunately a weak plot foreseeable dialogs a mostly unreal scenery and the mixed acting dont add up to create authenticity thus as a spectator i remained untouchedand then there were the clichés which drove me crazy one by one: snow white is a rich and spoiled upper class daughter - of course her parents are divorced and she never got enough love from them because they were so busy all the time her best girlfriend on the other hand has loving and caring parents they a steelworker and a housewife live in a tiny flat poor and happy - and ignorant of the desperate situation their daughter is in the good guy = prince is a musician ! from the french speaking part of switzerland which is considered to be the economically less successful but emotionally fitter fraction of the country he has problems with his parents they are migrants from spain who dont seem to accept his wild way of living - until the father becomes seriously ill and confesses his great admiration for his son from a hospital bedand so it goes on: naturally the drug dealer is brutal the bankers are heartless the club owner is a playboy and the photographer although a woman ! has only her career in mind when she exposes snow white in artsy pornographic pictures at a showthis review doesnt need a spoiler in order to let you add these pieces to an obvious plot as i like other films by samir eg forget baghdad i was quite disappointed lets hope for the next one<SEP>0
wow i love and respect pretty much anything that david lynch has done however this movie is akin to a first filmmakers attempt at making a pseudo art video to give you a couple of examples: 1 david lynch is typically a visual filmmaker however this had little visual artistic content blank walls up shots with ceiling in the background 2 david lynch typically takes great pride in audio however in this you could even hear the video cameras hum in fact it is very hard to swallow the idea that he had anything to do with this movie unlessthis is a joke on davids part to force fans search his website for hours only to find this drivel i hope so because at least that idea is funny<SEP>0
this movie is just truly awful the eye-candy that plays ben just can make up for everything else that is wrong with this moviethe writerdirectorproducerlead actor etc probably had a good idea to create a movie dealing with the important issues of gay marriage family acceptance religion homophobia hate crimes and just about every other issue effecting a gay man of these times but trying to ram every issue into such a poorly conceived film does little justice to any of these causesthe script is poor the casting very ordinary but the dialogue and acting is just woeful the homo-hating brother is played by the most camp actor and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two lead actors i think ive seen more passion in an corn flakes ad the acting is stiff and the dialogue forced a scene where the brother is feeding the detective his lines was the highlightim just pleased to see that the creator of this train wreck has not pushed any other rubbish out in to distribution and if he is thinking of doing so i have some advise - just dont do it<SEP>0
it helps if you understand czech and can see this in the original language and understand the czechs obsession with the professionals but if not jedna ruka netlaska is yet another great czech film it is funny dark and extremely enjoyable the highest compliment i can pay it is that you never know quite what is going to happen next and even keep that feeling well into the second and third viewingfor a small country the czech republic has produced an amazing amount of world class film and literature from hrabal hasek and kundera to the films of menzel sverak and numerous others czech humour by its very nature is dark and often uncompromising but often with a naive and warm sentiment behind it this film is just that it is unkind and deals with the less lovable sides of human beings but underneath it all there is a beautiful story full of promise good intent and optimismi highly recommend this and most other projects trojan and machacek are involved in enjoy it its a film made for just that reason - anyway its as close as the czechs will ever come to writing a truly happy ending<SEP>1
halfway through lajos koltais evening a woman on her deathbed asks a figure appearing in her hallucination: can you tell me where my life went the line could be embarrassingly theatrical but the woman speaking it is vanessa redgrave delivering it with utter simplicity and the question tears your heart outtime and again the film based on susan minots novel skirts sentimentality and ordinariness it holds attention offers admirable performances and engenders emotional involvement as few recent movies have with only six months of the year gone there are now two memorable meaningful worthwhile films in theaters the other of course being sara polleys away from her hollywood might have turned evening into a slick celebrity vehicle with its two pairs of real-life mothers and daughters - vanessa redgrave and natasha richardson and meryl streep and mamie gummer richardson is redgraves daughter in the film with a sister played by tony collette and gummer plays streeps younger self while redgraves youthful incarnation is claire danesadd glenn close eileen atkins hugh dancy patrick wilson and a large cast - yes it could have turned into a multiple star platform instead koltai - the brilliant hungarian cinematographer of mephisto and director of fateless - created a subtle ensemble work with a continental feel the story taking place in a high-society newport environment in the days leading up to a wedding that is fraught with troublemissed connections wrong choices and dutiful compliance with social and family pressures present quite a soap opera but the quality of the writing koltais direction and selfless acting raise evening way above that level into the the rarified air of english french and a few american family sagas from a century before its contemporary settingcomplex relationships between mothers and daughters between friends and lovers with the addition of a difficult triangle all come across clearly understandably captivatingly individual tunes are woven into a symphonyand yet with the all the foregoing emphasis on ensemble and selfless performances the stars of evening still shine through redgrave richardson gummer an exciting new discovery looking vaguely like her mother but a very different actress danes carrying most of the load - until streep shows up in the final moments and of course steals the show dancy and wilson are well worth the price of admission tooas with away from her evening stays with you at length inviting a re-thinking its story and characters and re-experiencing the emotions it raises at two hours the film runs a bit long but the way it stays with you thereafter is welcome among the many movies that go cold long before your popcorn<SEP>1
the minute you give an art film 110 you have people baying for your ignorant half-ass-ed artistically retarded blood i wont try and justify how i am not an aesthetically challenged retard by listing out all the art house cinema i have liked or mentioning how i gave some unknown cult classic a 1010 all i ask is that someone explain to me the point purpose and message of this filmhere is how i would summarize the film: opening montage of three unrelated urban legends depicting almost absurd levels of co-incidence this followed by in a nutshell to save you 3 hours of pain the following - a childrens game show host dying of lung cancer tries to patch things up with his coke-addicted daughter who he may or may not have raped when she was a child and who is being courted by a bumbling police officer with relationship issues while the game-shows star contestant decides that he doesnt want to be a failed child prodigy a fate which has befallen another one of the game show contestants from the 60s who we see is now a jobless homosexual in love with a bartender with braces and in need of money for corrective oral surgery while the game shows producer himself dying of lung cancer asks his male nurse to help him patch up with the son he abandoned years ago and who has subsequently become a womanizing self help guru even as mr producers second wife suffers from guilt pangs over having cheated a dying man; and oh eventually it rains frogs you read correctly and i am sparing you the unbelievably long and pointless literally rambling monologues each character seems to come up with on the fly for no rhyme or reason other than possibly to make sure the film crosses 3 hours and becomes classified as a modern epic you are probably thinking that i could have done a better job of summarizing the movie and in turn of not confusing you if i had written the damn thing a little more coherently maybe in a few sentences instead of just one well now you know how i feel<SEP>0
when i heard patrick swayze was finally returning to his acting career with king solomons mines i was very excited i was expecting a great indiana jones type action adventure what i got was a 4 hour long with commercials epic that was very slow the second and third hour could have been dropped altogether and the story would not have suffered for it the ending was good no spoilers herebut i was still left wanting more well all a guy can do is prey that swayze does roadhouse 2 so he can get back into the action genre that made him famous until than if your a fan of king solomons mines than read the book or watch the 1985 version with richard chamberlain and sharon stone which is also not very good but its only and hour and forty minutes of your life gone instead of 4 hours<SEP>1
massacre is a film directed by andrea bianchi burial ground and produced by legendary italian horror director lucio fulci now with this mix of great talent you would think this movie would have been a true gore fest this could not be further from that massacre falls right on its face as being one of the most boring slasher films i have seen come out of italian cinema i was actually struggling to stay awake during the film and i have never had that problem with italian horror filmsmassacre starts out with a hooker being slaughtered on the side of the road with an ax this scene was used in fulcis nightmare concert this isnt a bad scene and it raises your expectations of the movie as being an ax wielding slaughter unfortuanitly the next hour of the movie is so boring the movie goes on to a set of a horror film being filmed and there is a lot of character development during all these scenes but the characters in the movie are so dull and badly acted your interest starts to leak away the last 30 minutes of the movie arent so bad but still could have been much better the gore in the movie was pathetic and since fulci used most of the gore scenes in nightmare concert there was nothing new here the end of the movie did leave a nice twist but there was still to much unanswered and the continuity falls right through the floorthis wasnt a very good film but for a true italian horror freak like myself this movie is a must have since it is very rare 410 stars<SEP>0
i saw this on cable recently and kinda enjoyed it ive been reading the comments here and it seems that everyone likes the second half more than the first half personally i enjoyed the first story too bad that wasnt extended the second story i thought was cliched and that california dreaming if i hear that one more time chungking express is alright but its not something that mainstream audiences will catch on to see like crouching tiger<SEP>0
bad plot bad dialogue bad acting idiotic directing the annoying porn groove soundtrack that ran continually over the overacted script and a crappy copy of the vhs cannot be redeemed by consuming liquor trust me because i stuck this turkey out to the end it was so pathetically bad all over that i had to figure it was a fourth-rate spoof of springtime for hitlerthe girl who played janis joplin was the only faint spark of interest and that was only because she could sing better than the originalif you want to watch something similar but a thousand times better then watch beyond the valley of the dolls<SEP>0
apparently shakespeare equals high brow which equals in turn a bunch of folks not seeing something for what it really is at one point in this film someone i believe pacinos producer warns him that film is getting off track that it was once about how the masses think about shakespeare through the vehicle of richard iii instead he decides to shoot a chopped up play with random comments sprinkled throughout some scenes seemed to be included as home movies for al was there really any reason for the quick visit to shakespeares birthplace other than for a laugh about something unexpected which happens there and before the film has really even begun we are treated to seeing al prance around and act cute and funny for the camera i thought his silly act with kay near the end of godfather iii with the knife to his throat was an act - but apparently its how al really behaves in personenough rambling heres a shotgun smattering of why i didnt even make it 34 of the way through this: 1 pretentious - al always knows when the camera is on him whether hes acting as richard or in a real conversation with someone - you can see it in the corner of his eyes also some of the actors around the rehearsal table become untethered and wax hammy to the extreme if anyone reading this has ever spent any time with an group of actors and has witnessed this kind of thing from the outside its unbearable look at me chewing all the scenery! 2 winona ryder when she appears as lady anne this film comes to a screeching halt which it never recovers from she has nothing to add in the discussion scenes but the camera lingers on her to bring in the kiddoes her performance is dreadful to boot 3 the only things you really learn from this are told to you by the very scholars the filmmakers are trying to keep out of the picture of course you also learn that pacino shouldnt be directing films or doing richard in the first place id rather watch bobby deerfield than thislastly read the play and learn it for yourself go out and see it performed in 1997 i saw the play performed at the university of washington ethnic cultural theater and it made what we see in this film seem like high school drama except for the gratuitous throat slashing of clarence! my god! was that necessary!its all just a bunch of sound and fury signifying nada<SEP>0
carlito way the original is a brilliant story about an ex-drug dealer who hopes to leave his criminal past and so he invests in a club and the deals with the trouble that comes with itthis film wasi saw the trailer and knew instantly it was going to be badbut after dismissing films in the past and finding out they were great lucky number slevin tokyo drifti gave this a shot and it failed within the first five minutesthe script is something a teenager would come up with if given five minutes to prepareit was weak with weaker dialogue it seems there is an instant need for romance in a gangster movie so brigante decides to beat a guy up for the girland she says yes! and if you need to act bad just throw racism aroundas we learn from the italian mobstersthe acting was terrible to say the leasti found hollywood nicky hilariousi absolutely hate all these musicians turning to movies lets face it the only reason p diddy did this movie was so he could play a gangstersthe actress who plays leticia was weak but beautiful the sex scene was weak but we got to see herwhich was okaybut overall i expected it shed light on how carito ended up in prison and the love of his lifeand the assassin towards the end completely added to the horrendous movie that iscarlitos way: rise to power<SEP>0

it makes the actors in hollyoaks look like the royal shakespeare company this movie is jaw dropping in how appalling it is turning the dvd player off was not a sufficient course of action i want to find the people responsible for this disaster and slap them around the face i will never get that time back never how is it possible to create such a banal boring and soulless film i could not think of a course of action that would relieve the tedium writing the required ten lines is incredibly difficult for such a disgraceful piece of cinema what more can you say than reiterate how truly awful the acting is please avoid<SEP>0
i dont want to bore everyone by reiterating what has already been said but this is one of the best series ever! it was a great shame when it was canceled and i hope someone will have the good sense to pick it up and begin the series again the good news is that it is out on dvd!!!! i rushed down to the store and picked up a copy and am happy to say that it is just as good as i remembered it gary cole is a wonderfully dark and creepy character and all actors were very good it is a shame that the network did not continue it shaun cassidy this is a masterpiece anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it must do so you will not be disappointed my daughter who was too young to view it when it was on television she is 20 is becoming very interested and will soon be a fan she finds it very twisted and has enjoyed the episodes she has seen i cannot wait to view the episodes which were not airedthis show rocks!!!!<SEP>1
i read somewhere that when kay francis refused to take a cut in pay warner bros retaliated by casting her in inferior projects for the remainder of her contractshe decided to take the money but her career suffered accordinglythat might explain what she was doing in comet over broadway though it doesnt explain why donald crisp and ian hunter are in it too ludicrous is the word that others have used for the plot of this film and thats right on target the murder trial her seedy vaudeville career her success in london her final scene with her daughter no part logically leads to the next partalso the sets and costumes looked like b-movie stuff and her hair! turner is showing lots and lots of her movies this month watch any other one and youll be doing yourself a favor<SEP>0
a woman mujar marta belengur enters a restaurant one morning at &:35 unaware that a terrorist has kidnapped the people in said restaurant & is making them act out a musical number in this strange yet fascinating short film which i only saw by finding it on the dvd of the directorwriters equally fascinating timecrimes it had a fairly catchy song & it somehow brought a smile to my face despite the somber overall plot to the short im glad that i stumbled across it wasnt aware it would be an extra when i rented the dvd and wouldnt hesitate at all to recommend it to all of my friendsmy grade: a-<SEP>1
this movie is an insult to all submariners it was stupid it appeared to have been written by monkeys the acting was absurd if this is the view most people have of the navy then i weep for our defense this movie was awful i put it below voyage to the bottom of the sea as far as submarine movies go gene hackman must have really needed rent money to do this crap denzel washington must have been high little in the plot makes any sense and the ending for a mutineer to be rewarded for his crime only hollywood would think of this garbage if you havent figured it out yet i didnt like it and if it wasnt for all the pro comments i would not have bothered to post<SEP>0
bruce almighty one of carreys best pictures since well a long time it contains one of the funniest scenes i have seen for a long time too morgan freeman plays god well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny it contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes the best scene in it is where jim is messing up the anchor mans voicemy rating: 810<SEP>1
this movie was a major disappointment on direction intellectual niveau plot and in the way it dealt with its subject painting it is a slow moving film set like an episode of wonder years with appalling lack of depth though it also fails to deliver its message in a convincing mannerthe approach to the subject of painting is very elite limited to vague and subjective terms as beauty according to the makers of this movie beauty can be only experienced in bob-ross-style kitschy landscape paintings good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic like primary school level color theory and lots of sentiment in parts the movie is offending eg at a point it is stated rather celebrated by dancing on tables that mentally handicapped people are not capable of having emotions or expressing them through painting their works by definition being worthless bullshit quotei do not understand how the movie could get such high rating then again so far not many people rated it and they chose for only very high or very low grades<SEP>0
this movie has it all action fighting dancing bull riding music pretty girls this movie is an authenic look at middle america believe me i was there in 1980 lots of oil money lots of women and lots of honky tonks too bad they are all gone now the movie is essentially just another boy meets girl boy loses girl boy gets girl back but it is redeemed by the actors and the music there is absolutely no movie with any better music that this movie and that includes american graffiti it is a movie i watch over and over again and never get tired of it every time i watch it i am young again and it is time to go out honky tonking the only reason i only gave it a 9 is because you cannot rate a movie zero i do not feel you should rate one 10<SEP>1
riding giants is an amazing movie it really shows how these people lived back then just to surf their lives were basically surfing living breathing and having fun they didnt care about money jobs girls or any thing to them the waves were their girls i have never been on a surf board and it looks so hard i dont understand how they can stay on them it makes no sense at all this is an awesome movie and if you love surfing then you should really see this movie if youre a surfer and you want to find out who started surfing how it came into life who is really famous at it or what ever then you should really see it it might be a documentary but it is really good -tara f-<SEP>1
this was thought to be the flagship work of the open source community something that would stand up and scream at the worlds media to take notice as were not stuck in the marketing trap with our options in producing fine work with open source tools after the basic version download die hard fan here on a dial-up modem eventually got here i hit my first snag media player mplayer classic & winamp failed to open it on my xp box and then totem xine & kaffeine failed to open it on my suse server mplayer managed to run it flawlessly going to be hard to spread the word about it if normal users cant even open itthe film beautiful soundtrack superb lighting masterful camera work and flawless texturing everything looked real and then the two main characters moved and spoke and the movie died for me everything apart from the lip syncing and the actual animation of the two main characters except for proog in the dancing scene looked fluid and totally alive the two main characters were animated so poorly that at times i was wondering if there are any games on the market at the moment with cut-scenes that entail less realism than thisany frame in the movie is fantastic as a frame and the thing is great if neither actors are moving im so glad i havent actually recommended this to anyone id ruin my reputationoh and final fantasy had a more followable and cunningly devised plotthis movie would get 10 stars if it wasnt for the tragedy that sits right there on the screen<SEP>0
im always surprised about how many times youll see something about world war 2 on the german national television you would think they dont like to open old wounds but there isnt a week that goes by without a documentary or a movie about the horror and atrocities of this war perhaps its a way of dealing with their past i dont know but you sure cant blame them of ignoring what happened and it has to be said: most of those documentaries are really worth a watch because they never try to gloss over the truth and the same can be said about their movies think for instance about der untergang or the downfall as you might now it which are also very realisticone of those movies is rosenstrasse it tells a true story and deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the war even though the movie starts with a family in the usa at the present day after hannahs father died her mother all a sudden turned into an orthodox jew even though she hasnt been very religious before she doesnt know where the strange behavior of her mother comes from but as she starts digging in her mothers troubled childhood hannah understands how little she has ever known about her mothers pastthe fact that this movie deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the nazi regime is already quite surprising for as far as i know there hasnt been another movie that deals with this subject for those who didnt know this yet: being married to a so-called pure aryian man or woman meant for many jews that they werent immediately sent to one of the concentration camps but that they had to work in a factory but it does not only tell something about the problems of the mixed marriages it also gives a good idea of how these people were often seen by their own parents and relatives how difficult it sometimes was for them during the nazi regime and how these people most of the time women did everything within their power to free their men once they were captured and locked away in for instance the rosenstrassethe acting is really good and the story is very well written although the way it was presented in the beginning didnt really do it for me and thats exactly the only part that youll get to see in the trailer perhaps its just me but i would have left out a big part of what happens in the present day at least of the part that is situated in the usa because the part where hannah goes to berlin and talks to someone who knows more about her mothers past definitely worksif you are interested in everything that has something to do with the second world war and if you arent necessarily looking for a lot of action shots than this is definitely a movie you should see this isnt a movie in which youll see any battles or gunfights but it certainly is an interesting movie because it gives you an idea about an aspect of the war only little is known of i give it an 810<SEP>1
if ever i was asked to remember a song from a film of yester years then it would have to be chalo di daar chalo chand ke paar chalo for its meaning the way it is sung by lata mangeshkar and mohd rafi the lyrics by kaif bhopali and not to mention the cinema photography when the sailing boat goes out against the black background and the shining stars the other would have to be chalte chalte pakeezah was meena kumaris last film before she died and the amount of it time it took can be seen on the screen in each of the the songs that are picturised she looks young but after that she does not but one actor who didnt change in his looks was the late raj kumar who falls in love with her and especially her feet after he accidentally goes into her train cabin and upon seeing them he leaves a note describing how beautiful they areconclusion: pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story that if at all possible should be viewed on large screen just for the sake of the cinema photography and songs the movie stars the meena kumari raj kumar and ashok kumar and is directed by kamal amrohikamal amrohis grandson has now started to revive his grand fathers studio by making a comedy movie<SEP>1
of all movies and im a film graduate if thats worth anything to you this is the worst movie i have ever seen i know there are probably some worse ones out there that i just havent seen yet but i have seen this and this is the worst a friend and i rented it one night because denise richards was on the cover talk about being young and retarded shes uncredited! her role was unbelievably small! how did she make it on the cover! imdb doesnt even list it in her filmography this movie was so bad we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it and slipped it inside the case it read something like please save your further customers from having to view this complete and totally bad movie!<SEP>0

this is short and to the point the story writing used for star trek: hidden frontier is surprisingly good acting is all over the map but the main characters over the years seem to have worked at improving their skills it is hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years and will be coming to end mid-may 2007i will not rehash what has already been said about the sets and graphics considering this is all-volunteer for no profit it is pretty amazingif this was being ranked as a professional production i would have to give it a 5 for a good story but terrible sets however as a fan-based production i have to give it an excellent rating as with the exception with a few other efforts this is in a league of its own for sheer volume i dont think this has been matched congratulations to the cast and crew for an effort that many admire<SEP>1
really bad movie the story is too simple and predictable and poor acting as a complementthis vampires hunter story is the worst that i have seen so far derek bliss jon bon jovi travels to mexico in search for some blood suckers! he use some interesting weapons but nothing compared to blade and is part of some van helsig vampires hunters net ok but he work alone hes assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen that is searching some black crucifix to perform a ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight is almost a sequel of vampires 1998 directed by john carpenter and starred by james woods derek start his quest in the search of the queen with some new friends: sancho diego luna really bad acting also a teenager without experience father rodrigo cristian de la fuente a catholic priest zoey natasha wagner a particular vampire and ray collins darius mccrary another expert vampire hunter so obviously in this adventure he isnt aloneyou can start feeling how this movie would be just looking at his lead actor jon bon jovi; is a huge difference in the acting quality compared to james woods and then if you watch the film i dont recommend this part you will get involved in one of the more simplest stories totally predictable with terrible acting performances really bad special effects and incoherent events!i deeply recommend not to see this film! rent another movie see another channel go out with your friends etc310<SEP>0
when i first heard that hal hartley was doing a sequel to henry fool i was excited its been a personal favorite for years now and then wary when i heard it had something to do with terrorism having just seen it though i was surprised to find that it worked while still being an entirely different sort of movie than henry fool the writing and direction were both dead on and the acting was superbespecial kudos go to hartley for reassembling virtually the whole cast right down to henrys son who was only four in the original like i said though this movie is quite different from the first but it works: i reconciled myself with the change in tone and subject matter to the fact that 10 years have passed and the characters would have found themselves in very different situations since the first film ended in this case an unexpected adventure ensuesand thats about all ill give awaynot to mention the fact that ill need to see it again to really understand whats going on and whos double crossing who while it was certainly one of the better movies ive seen in some time it suffers like many sequels with its ending as it appears that hartley is planning a third now and the film leaves you hanging ill be sure to buy my tickets for part 3 henry grim in 2017<SEP>1
hollow man starts as brilliant but flawed scientist dr sebastian caine kevin bacon finally works out how to make things visible again after having been turned invisible by his own serum they test the serum on an already invisible gorilla & it works perfectly caine & his team of assistants celebrate but while he should report the breakthrough to his military backers caine wants to be the first invisible human he manages to persuade his team to help him & the procedure works well & caine becomes invisible however when they try to bring him back the serum fails & he remain invisible the team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory but then again hes invisible right he can do anything he wantsdirected by paul verhoeven i rather liked hollow man you know its just after christmas i saw this a few hours ago on late nightearly morning cable tv & worst of all i feel sick not because of the film but because of the chocolates & fizzy pop ive had over the past week so ill keep this one brief the script by andrew w marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle & has a good central premise it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original the invisible man 1933 film which hollow man obviously owes a fair bit it manages to have a petty successful blend of horror sci-fi & action & provide good entertainment value for 110 odd minutes i thought the characters were ok i thought some of the ideas in the film were good although i think its generally known that verhoeven doesnt deal in subtlety the first thing he has the invisible caine do is sexually molest one of his team & then when he gets into the outside world he has caine rape a woman with the justification whos going to know that caine says to himself then of course theres the gore he shows a rat being torn apart & thats just the opening scene after the credits to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty & sadistic tone about it having said that i love horrorgoreexploitation films so hollow man delivers for me its just that it might not be everyones cup of teadirector verhoeven does a great job or should that be the special effects boys make him look good the special effects in hollow man really are spectacular & more-or-less flawless their brilliant & its as simple & straight forward as that theres some good horror & action set-pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over-the-top i love the effect where kevin bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins organs & bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the gorilla theres a few gory moments including a rat being eaten someone is impaled on a spike & someone has their head busted open with blood splattering resultswith a staggering budget of about $95000000 hollow man is technically faultless i can imagine the interviews on the dvd where some special effects boffin says they mapped bacons entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position wouldnt they the acting was ok bacon made for a good mad scientist anti-hero type guyhollow man is one of hose big budget hollwood extravaganzas where the effects & action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or characters but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film well i know i do good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier & darker streak than the usual hollywood product definitely worth a watch<SEP>1
panic in the streets is an exciting and atmospheric thriller in which director elia kazan achieved a great sense of realism by shooting the movie in new orleans using a number of local people to fill various roles and making intelligent use of improvisation as a result the characters and dialogue both seem very natural and believable an important deadline which has to be met in order to avoid a disaster provides the story with its great sense of urgency and pace and the problems which delay the necessary action from being taken then increase the tension to a high levelfollowing a dispute between the participants in a card game a man called kochak lewis charles is shot and his body is dumped in the dock area when the body is found and the coroner identifies the presence of a virus us public health official dr clinton reed richard widmark is called in and his examination confirms the presence of pneumonic plague reed insists that all known contacts of the dead man must be inoculated without delay because the very infectious nature of the disease means that without such action anyone infected could be expected to die within daysas the identity of the dead man is unknown the task of finding his contacts is expected to be difficult and this situation is not helped when city officials and the police commissioner are not fully convinced by reeds briefing they doubt that the threat to the public is potentially as serious as he claims it is and their initial lack of commitment is just the first of a series of obstacles which prevent action from being taken urgently the investigation that follows is hampered by a lack of cooperation from the immigrant community a group of seamen the proprietor of a restaurant and also some illegal immigrants before the mans identity and his contacts are eventually foundkochak an illegal immigrant had been in a gang with blackie jack palance raymond fitch zero mostel and vince poldi tommy cook and when gang leader blackie becomes aware of the ongoing police investigation he presumes that kochak mustve smuggled something very valuable into the country as kochak and poldi were related blackie assumes that poldi must know something about this and goes to find out more poldi however is very ill and unable to provide any information blackie brings in his own doctor and together with fitch starts to move poldi out of his room and down some stairs and this is when they meet up with reed and an exciting chase followsrichard widmark gives a strong performance as an underpaid public official who copes efficiently with the onerous responsibilities of his job whilst also dealing with his domestic preoccupations as a family man in an unusual type of role for him he also portrays the determined and serious minded nature of dr reed very convincingly jack palances film debut sees him giving an impressive performance as a ruthless thug who misjudges kochaks reason for leaving the card game and also the reason for the intense police investigation his distinctive looks also help to make his on-screen presence even more compellingin typical docu-noir style expressionist cinematography and neo-realist influences are utilized in tandem to effectively capture the atmosphere of the locations in which the action takes place elia kazan directs with precision throughout but also excels in the memorable chase sequence in the warehouse and on the dockside<SEP>1
charles mcdougalls resume includes directing episodes on sex and the city desperate housewives queer as folk big love the office etc so he comes with all the credentials to make the tv film version of meg wolitzers novel surrender dorothy a success and for the most part he manages to keep this potentially sappy story about sudden death of a loved one and than manner in which the people in her life react afloatsara alexa davalos a beautiful unmarried young woman is accompanying her best friends - gay playwright adam tom everett scott adams current squeeze shawn chris pine and married couple maddy lauren german and peter josh hopkins with their infant son - to a house in the hamptons for a summer vacation the group seems jolly until a trip to the local ice creamery by adam and sara results in an auto accident which kills sara meanwhile saras mother natalie swedlow diane keaton who has an active social life but intrusively calls here daughter constantly with the mutual greeting surrender dorothy is playing it up elsewhere: when she receives the phone call that sara is dead she immediately comes to the hamptons where her overbearing personality and grief create friction among saras friends slowly but surely natalie uncovers secrets about each of them thriving on talking about sara as though doing so would bring her to life natalies thirst for truth at any cost results in major changes among the group and it is only through the binding love of the departed sara that they all eventually come togetherdiane keaton is at her best in these roles that walk the thread between drama and comedy and her presence holds the story together the screenplay has its moments for good lines but it also has a lot of filler that becomes a bit heavy and morose making the actors obviously uncomfortable with the lines they are given yes this story has been told many times - the impact of sudden death on the lives of those whose privacy is altered by disclosures - but the film moves along with a cast pace and has enough genuine entertainment to make it worth watching grady harp<SEP>1
seeing as the vote average was pretty low and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was just ok i didnt have much expectations when renting this filmbut contrary to the above i enjoyed it a lot this is a charming movie it didnt need to grow on me i enjoyed it from the beginning mel brooks gives a great performance as the lead character i think somewhat different from his usual persona in his moviestheres not a lot of knockout jokes or something like that but there are some rather hilarious scenes and overall this is a very enjoyable and very easy to watch filmvery recommended<SEP>1
wellnow that i know where rob zombie stole the title for his house of 1000 corpses crapfest i can now rest in peace nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in the house of seven corpses but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot ha! anyway to kill the bloody amateurs making a low-rent horror flick in his former abode! in hell house sorry i dont remember the actual name of the residence a bunch of mysterious unexplained deaths took place long ago; some like arthritic lurch stand-in john carradine whose small role provides the films only worthwhile moments attribute it to the supernatural; bellowing film director john ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum the result comes across like satans school for girls catchy title; made-for-tv production values; intriguing plot crossed with children shouldnt play with dead things low-rent movie about low-rent movie makers who wake the dead; trouble is its nowhere near as entertaining or fun the house of seven corpses is dead at frame one and spends the rest of its 89 minutes going through rigor mortis dragging us along for every aching second<SEP>0
be warned! this is crap that other crap wont even deign to be in company with because its beneath them! okay got that out of the way let me say something more substantiveive seen ashes of time a very long time ago thinking it was a fresh take on the material which is based on a highly revered wuxia tome of a novel due to the emerging reputation of the director wong kar wai well despite of all of that wkw hasnt succeeded at adapting the novel on screen according to a lot of wuxia fans; mostly it is just shots of dripping water beads of sweats legs of horses running etc i couldnt sit through most of the moviefast forward many years later when i wanted to give mr wongs movies another shot after hearing many praises especially from cannes i was intrigued by his latest 2046 a friend told me to start w chungking express because it is his most accessible movies so wrong! i was just po that i got duped into wasting my time and money on this piece of pretentious nothingness some professional reviewers mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a modern big city blah blah blah its all fine if the director has a point of view with something to say as to why these things happen and tell it but no he merely shows what is faye wongs acting is very typical of hong kongs style: garbled enunciation deer in the headlight wide eye expression try to be cute and girlish kind of acting; the rest of the cast is equally uninspiredi think the word auteur is a euphemism for a director who tries something new and different which is to be applauded but not one who hasnt yet mastered the art of cinematic story telling which is what mr wong is for the last 17 years!<SEP>0
way way back in the 1980s long before nafta was drafted and corporations began to shed their national identities the united states and japan were at each others throat in the world manufacturing race remember sayings like union yes! the japanese are taking this country over and americans are lazyas the reagan era winded down and corporations edged towards a global marketplace director ron howard made one of several trips into the comedy genre with his 1986 smash gung ho which drew over $36 million in us box office receipts while in many ways dated howards tongue-in-cheek story of colliding cultures in the workplace still offers hard truth for industrial life todaygung ho focuses on hunt stevenson michael keaton the automakers union rep from hadleyville a small depressed town in the foothills of pennsylvania stevenson has been asked to visit the assan motor company in tokyo similar to real-life toyota which is considering a us operation at the towns empty plant with hundreds of residents out of work and the town verging on collapse assan decides to move in and stevenson is hired as a liaison between company officials and workers on the assembly linethe 112 minutes of gung ho is a humorous look at these two sides with their strengths and weaknesses equally considered: on one hand an american workforce that values its traditions but is often caught in the frenzy of pride and trade unionism; on the other hand japanese workers who are extremely devoted to their job yet lacking in personal satisfaction and feelings of self-worth in stevenson we find an american working class figure of average intelligence with the skills to chat people through misunderstandings with the survival of his workers jobs and most of hadleyville on the line stevenson proves a likable guy who wants nothing more than a fair chance although his cleverness will sink him into a great deal of trouble besides answering to the heads of assan we witness a delicate balancing act between stevenson and his fellow union members many of whom he grew up with this includes buster george wendt willie john turturro and paul clint howard rons brotherthe japanese cast is headed by gedde watanabe also known for sixteen candles and volunteers watanabe plays kazihiro the plant manager who is down on his luck and begins to feel a sympathy for american life he is constantly shadowed by saito sab shimono the nephew of assans ceo who is desperate to take his spot in the pecking order while given a light touch these characters fare very well in conveying ideas of the japanese working culturewith hunt stevenson dominating the script michael keaton has to give a solid performance for this film to work gung ho is indeed a slam-dunk success for keaton who also teamed with ron howard in 1994s the paper he made this film during a string of lighter roles that included mr mom beetle juice and the dream team before venturing into batman one good cop and my life its also hard not to like gedde watanabes performance as the odd man out who first wears japanese ribbons of shame before teaming up with stevenson to make the auto plant a cohesive unitthe supporting cast is top-notch including wendt turturro shimono and soh yamamura as assan ceo sakamoto mimi rogers supplies a romantic interest as audrey hunts girlfriend edwin blum lowell ganz and babaloo mandel teamed up for gung hos solid writing the incidental music which received a bmi film music award was composed by thomas newman gung hos soundtrack songs are wall-to-wall 80s including dont get me wrong tuff enuff and working class manthe success of gung ho actually led to a short-lived tv series on abc while more impressive as a social commentary twenty years ago ron howards film still has its comic value it is available on dvd as part of the paramount widescreen collection and is a tad short-changed audio options are provided in english 51 surround english dolby surround and french dubbing but subtitles are in english only there are no extras not even the theatrical trailer on the plus side paramounts digital transfer is quite good with little grain after the opening credits and high quality sound while a few extras would have been helpful - especially that gung ho was a box office success - theres little to complain about the film presentation itself*** out of 4<SEP>1
this is the best of shelley duvalls high-quality faerie tale theatre series the ugly stepsisters are broadway-quality comedy relief and eve arden is the personification of wicked stepmotherhood jennifer beals does an excellent job as a straight cinderella especially in the garden scene with matthew brodericks prince charming jean stapleton plays the fairy godmother well although im not sure i liked the southern lady characterization with some of the lines steve martins comedy relief as the royal orchestra conductor is quintessential martin but a tiny bit misplaced in the shows flowas is customary with the series there are several wry comments thrown in for the older children ages 15 and up with a couple of small bumps the show flows well and they live happily ever after children up to age 8 will continue to watch it after the parents finally get tired of it -- i found 3 times in one day to be a little too much<SEP>1
this movie promised bat people it didnt deliver there was a guy who got bit by a bat but what was with the seizures and the stupid transformation where was the plot where was the acting who came up with the idea to make this why was it allowed to be made why why i guess well never know<SEP>0
the premise of the story is simple: an old man living alone in the woods accidentally stumble upon a murder of a small child and tries to convince the police that the murder has occurred though very little dialog is provided throughout the film the visual narrative told by the cameras eye alone made the film quite engaging the setting of the gray woods conveys a feeling of loneliness which complements the quietness of the characters themselves we can also sense helplessness in the old mans inability to convince the police of the murder which parallels the silenced childs inability to tell her own storytrue horror lies in feelings of hopelessness helplessness and irrationality this film successfully addresses these elements by visuals alone rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and gore that other bad horror films use when the narrative is weakcleverly the story unfolds at a slow pace to build up tension for a few creepy and startling moments the ending is also unexpected and believable reminiscent of japanese horror films such as the ring and dark water or english horror films such as lady in black and the innocents this film provides viewers the experience of true atmosphere horror i recommend anyone who enjoys a good chilling to the bone scare to give this film a tryby the way if you havent seen the films i just mentioned above you might want to give them a try as well<SEP>1
theres really no way to beat around the bush in saying this lady death: the motion picture just plain sucks aside from the fact that the main character is a well endowed blonde running around hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts of graphic violence the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980s cartoon based on a line of action figures the bad guy himself even talks like a skeletor wannabe has the obligatory inept henchman and lives in a lair that looks to have been patterned after the domain of the villain from the old saturday morning blackstar cartoon just dont expect any humor other than the sometimes howlingly bad dialogue at other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to hentai yet there is no sex no tentacle rape thank goodness! and very little sex appeal this despite the physical appearance of the title character there is simply no adult edge to this material unless you count the half-naked heroine and bloody deaths essentially what we have here is a feature length episode of she-ra princess of power but with skimpier clothes and more gore<SEP>0
oh where to begin the cinematography was great when the movie first started because of the initial landscape scenes i thought that i was in for a good movie then the cgi bigfoot showed up it looked like a cartoon drawing of the lion king and king kongs love childit totally took away from the believability of the characternow i knew there wasnt a bigfoot chasing people hiking around the woods for no apparent reason but a cheesy cgi cartoonso from then on the whole movie was shot for methe money they flushed down the toilet for the cgi they could of spent on a costume like roger patterson did his was the best bigfoot costume ever no one else could match hisi am a hardcore cheesy bigfoot movie fan and i was warned about this movie but my compulsion led me to watching this movie and i was disappointed like the previous reviews warned me about i know after you read this review you will still say i must watch sasquatch huntersmust watch sasquatch hunters then you will say why did i waste my good hard earned money on such a excruciatingly bad boring movie!<SEP>0
the movie is just plain funmaybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of the ramones around the time the film was made ive watched the film over and over by myself and with friends and it is still fresh and funny at the risk of being too serious the concept of being a big fan of a certain band is timeless and high school students boredom with drudgery of some classes is just as timelessand the film has some gem linesscenesreferences to how our permanent record in high school will follow us through life let me assure you ive been out of high school for uhhh some years and its not following methe famous static line im getting some staticnot as much as youre going to get as principal togar approachesthe school board member who is so decrepit hes attended by nursesthe nazi hall monitors love for a body search principal togar announcing i give you the final solution and burning the ramones records note: records were what came before cds and of course joey ramone noting things sure have changed since we got kicked out of high school followed by togar asking do your parents know youre ramonesjust one piece of advicedont look up where the stars are nowjoey ramone sadly died young dey young who was a major hottie in the film today reminds us we all agepj soles career never advanced as we might have expected marla rosenfield as one the other students apparently appeared only in this film one of my male friends dies over her every time we watch the film though i submit her performance was more than adequate and should have brought her more teen film roles and does anyone know what happened to dj don steele so watch and enjoydont thinkjust have fun!<SEP>1

i like goldie hawn and wanted another one of her films so when i saw protocol for $550 at walmart i purchased it although mildly amusing the film never really hits it a stride some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no purposethen of course there is the preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as im concerned i dont think this scene added to the movie at all i dont like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson written by some 60s burn out especially!in the end although im glad to possess another hawn movie im not sure it was really worth the money i paid for it!<SEP>0
one could wish that an idea as good as the invisible man would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects but this is not the case the story the characters and finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad-scientist flick from the early 50s there are some great moments mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets but alas soon were back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable but schematicthere has been a great many remakes of old films or tv shows over the past 10 years and some of them have their charms but its becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol classics under the noses of eager madmen like verhoeven who does have his moments is a very bad one it is obvious that the money is the key issue here: the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough and as a result hollow man is seriously undermined with clichés sappy characters predictability and lack of any depth whatsoeverhowever the one thing that actually impressed me beside the special effects was the swearing when making this kind of film modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them therefore the language and sometimes the violence and sex is very toned down when the whole world blows up the good guys go oh darn! and oh my god hollow man gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them im not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear - but it makes it more believable if someone actually swears i think we can thank verhoeven for that<SEP>0
i truly despised this film when i saw it at the age of about 6 or 7 as i was a huge fan of robin williams and nothing he could do was bad until this this complete trash ruined robin for me for a long time im only recovering recently with his funny but serious part in fathers day but then he went on to create another mistake bicenntinial man i think it was called but the point is robin should be getting much better jobs by now and now he has returned to performing the slime that originated with this classic<SEP>0
i have been a hindi movie buff since the age of 4 but never in my life have a watched such a moving and impacting movie especially as a hindi film in the past several years i had stopped watching contemporary hindi movies and reverted to watching the classics teesri kasam mere huzoor madhumati mother india sholay etc but this movie changed everything it is one of the best movies i have ever seen i found it not only to be moving but also found it to be very educational for someone who is a first generation indian woman growing up in america it helped me to understand my own family history which was always something very abstract to me but to see it feel it and understand it helped me to sympathize with the generations before me and the struggle that indian people endured the film helped to put many things into perspective for me especially considering the current world events i never thought that a movie could change the way i think like this before it did the plot is fantastic the acting superb and the direction is flawless two thumbs up!<SEP>1
it was almost unfathomable to me that this film would be a bust but i was indeed disappointed having been a connoisseur of pekinpah cinema for years i found this dvd drastically reduced for sale and thought it was worth a shot the opening few credits iconic to pekinpah fans has the inter-cutting between man and animal but here we have non-diegetic ambient noise of children playing in a schoolyard while a bomb is being planted fantastic suspense then when the perps caan and duval travel to their next mission duval drops the bomb on cann that his date last night had an std found only by snooping through her purse while cann was being intimate with her the ensuing laughter is fantastic and is clearly paid homage to in brian depalmas dressed to kill at the short-lived expense of angle dickenson the problem with the killer elite is that after the opening credits the film falls flat even bring me the head of alfredo garcia has stronger production value a bold call for anyone who knows what im talking about i use pekinpahs credits as supplementary lecture material but once they are finished turn the killer elite off<SEP>0
well waynes world is long gone and the years since then have been hard for snl off-shoot movies from such cinematic offal as its pat to the recent 80 minute yawn a night at the roxbury many have no doubt lost faith that any other snl skit will ever make a successful transition to the silver screen well fear not because tim meadows comes through in spades the well-written plot maintains audience interest until the very end and while it remains true to the leon phelps character introduced in the five minute skit the storyline allows the character to develop the humor consisting largely of sex jokes is fresh and interesting and made me laugh harder than i have in any movie in recent memory its a just great time if you dont feel like taking yourself too seriously tiffany-amber thiessen of saved by the bell fame makes an appearance in the film and looks incredible finally billy dee williams reliving his colt 45 days gives the movie a touch of class and for those out there who are mindless movie quoters like myself you will find this movie to be eminently quotable ooh its a lady!<SEP>1
this guy has no idea of cinema okay it seems he made a few interestig theater shows in his youth and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship this all is very good but look carefully: he does not know his job! the scenes are unbalanced without proper start and and with a disordered content and full of emptiness he has nothing to say about the subject so he over-licitates with violence nakedness and gutter language how is it possible to keep alive such a rotten corpse who never understood anything of cinematographic profession and art why dont they let him succumb in piece<SEP>0
despite being told from a british perspective this is the best ww ii documentary ever produced presented in digestible as digestible as war can be episodes as the grave voice of laurence olivier connects the multitudes of eye witnesses who were forced to live the events of that horrific time eagerly awaiting its appearance on dvd in the us the europeans had their opportunity with a release in dvd earlier this year<SEP>1
this show is so full of action and everything needed to make an awsome show but best of all it actually has a plot unlike some of those new reality shows it is about a transgenic girl who escapes from her military holding base i totally suggest bying the dvds ive already preordered them i suggest you do to<SEP>1
im usually not one to say that a film is not worth watching but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance the only true upside to this film is cornelia sharpe looking rather attractive and the fact that this film is really shortthe plot in the film is unbelievably boring and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film none of the characters are even remotely interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone im not sure why on earth sean connery agreed to do this film but he should have definitely passed on this onethe only reason i could see for seeing this film is if you are a die-hard sean connery fan and simply want to see everything hes done save this one for last thoughwell if you by some miracle end up seeing this despite my review or any of the other reviews on this site then i hope you enjoy it more than i did thanks for reading<SEP>0
mirror mirror 1990 is a flat out lame movie why did i watch movies like this when i was younger who knows maybe i was one for punishing myself by watching one terrible movie after another i dont know i guess i needed a hobby during my teen years a teenage outcast rainbow harvest seeks solace in an old mirror soon she learns about the horrific power this antique mirror has and uses it to strike out against those who have wronged her movies like these the power giver has a nasty side effect this one changes her inside and out if she likes it or nota mess of a movie that for some reason was restored on dvd a few years back i dont know why they should have left it on the shelf and collect dust people love this movie foe some reason if you do i would like to know why until then i dislike this movie and i have no reason to ever watch it againnot recommended at all<SEP>0
2 words: academy award nuff said this film had everything in it comedy to make me laugh drama to make me cry and one of the greatest dance scenes to rival breakin 2: electric boogaloo the acting was tip top of any independant film jeremy earl was in top form long since seen since his stint on the joan cusack show his lines were executed with dynamite precision and snappy wit last seen in a very young jimmy walker i thought i saw the next emergance of a young denzel washington when the line my bus!! its gone that was the true turning point of the movie my grandmother loved it sooo much that i bought her the dvd and recommended it to her friends it will bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart as you see the white tony donato and african american nathan davis bond through thick being held up at knife point and thin nathan giving tony tips on women the new dynamic duo has arrived and are out to conquer hollywood<SEP>1
ive always liked this john frankenheimer film good script by elmore leonard and the main reason this wasnt just another thriller is because of frankenheimer his taut direction and attention to little details make all the difference he even hired porn star ron jeremy as a consultant! you can make a case that its the last good film roy scheider made ive always said that robert trebor gave just a terrific performance clarence williams iii got all the publicity with his scary performance and hes excellent also but i really thought trebor stood out frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail murder sex drugs and real porno actors appear in sleazy parts what can you say about a film that has ann margaret being shot up with drugs and raped a guilty pleasure to say the least vanity has a real sleazy role and a very young kelly preston makes an early appearance a classic exploitive thriller that shouldnt be forgotten<SEP>1
just about everything in this movie is wrong wrong wrong take mike myers for example hes reached the point where you realize that his shtick hasnt changed since his snl days over ten years ago hes doing the same cutesy stream-of-consciousness jokes and the same voices his cat is painfully unfunny he tries way to hard hes some weird type a comedian not the cool cat hes supposed to be the rest of the movie is just as bad the sets are unbelievably ugly --- and clearly a waste of millions of dollars cardboard cut-outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street alec balwin tries to do a funny great santini impression but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent theres even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity paris hilton --- that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a dr seuss story avoid this movie at all costs folks its not even an interesting train wreck i hope theyll make horton hears a who with robin williams then well have the bad-seuss movie-starring-spasitc- comedian trilogy<SEP>0
the plainsman represents the directorial prowess of cecil b demille at its most inaccurate and un-factual it sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than wild bill hickok gary cooper buffalo bill cody james ellison calamity jane jean arthur george armstrong custer and abraham lincoln to interact even though in reality lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place every once in a while demille floats dangerously close toward the truth but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship the film is an attempt to buttress custers last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends truly this is the world according to demille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment but a pretty campy relic by todays standardstransfer: considering the vintage of the film this is a moderately appealing transfer with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks theres a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments all in all the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent but it is never all bad or all good  just a bit better than middle of the road age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract the audio is mono but nicely balancedextras: forget it its universal! bottom line: as pseudo-history painted on celluloid this western is compelling and fun just take its characters and story with a grain of salt  in some cases  a whole box seems more appropriate!<SEP>1
hilarious evocative confusing brilliant film reminds me of bunuels lage dor or jodorowskys holy mountain-- lots of strange characters mucking about and looking for what is it i laughed almost the whole way through all the while keeping a peripheral eye on the bewildered and occasionally horrified reactions of the audience that surrounded me in the theatre entertaining through and through from the beginning to the guts and poisoned entrails all the way to the end if it was an end i only wish i could remember every detail it haunts me sometimeshonestly though i have only the most positive recollections of this film as it doesnt seem to be available to take home and watch i suppose ill have to wait a few more years until crispin glover comes my way again with his big slide show and subsequent what is it screening i saw this film in atlanta almost directly after being involved in a rather devastating car crash so i was slightly dazed at the time which was perhaps a very good state of mind to watch the prophetic talking arthropods and the retards in the superhero costumes and godlike glover in his appropriate burly-q setting scantily clad girlies rising out of the floor like a magnificent dadaist wet dreamis it a statement on life as we know it of course everyone expects art to be just that i rather think that the truth is more evident in the absences and in the negative space what you dont tell us is what we must deduce but is far more valid than the lies that other people feed us day in and day out rather one what is it than 5000 movies like titanic or sleepless in seattle shudder gag groanthank you mr glover additionally a fun man to watch on screen or at his big slide show-- smart funny quirky and outrageously hot make more films write more books keep the nightmare alive<SEP>1
this really should deserve a o rating or even a negative ten i watched this show for ages and the show jumped the shark around series 7 this episode however is proof that the show has jumped the shark its writing is lazy absurd self-indulgent and not even worthy of rubbish like beavis and buttheadit is quite possible to be ridiculous and still be fun -- pirates of the caribbean the mummy count of monte cristo -- all fun movies that are not to be taken seriously however there is such thing as ridiculous as in this is the worst thing ive ever seen and indeed this is the worst episode of stargate ive ever seen its absolutely dreadful and this coming from someone with a stargate in her basementmakes me want to sell all of my stargate props most seriously<SEP>0
a noted cinematic phenomenon of the late eighties and early nineties was the number of oscars which went to actors playing characters who were either physically or mentally handicapped the first was marlee matlins award for children of a lesser god in 1986 and the next ten years were to see another best actress award holly hunter for the piano in 1994 and no fewer than five best actor awards dustin hoffman in 1988 for rain man daniel day-lewis in 1989 for my left foot al pacino in 1992 for scent of a woman tom hanks in 1994 for forrest gump and geoffrey rush in 1996 for shine for portrayals of the disabled matlin who played a deaf woman is herself deaf but all the others are able-bodied this phenomenon aroused some adverse comment at the time with suggestions being made that these awards were given more for political correctness than for the quality of the acting when jodie foster failed to win best actress for nell in 1994 some people saw this as evidence of a backlash against this sort of portrayal my view however is that the majority of these awards were well deserved i thought the 1992 award should have gone to either clint eastwood or robert downey rather than pacino but apart from that the only one with which i disagreed would have been hanks and that was because i preferred nigel hawthornes performance in the madness of king george in that film of course hawthorne played a character who was mentally ill my left foot was based upon the autobiography of the irish writer and painter christy brown brown was born in 1931 one of the thirteen children of a working-class dublin family he was born with cerebral palsy and was at first wrongly thought to be mentally handicapped as well he was for a long time incapable of deliberate movement or speech but eventually discovered that he could control the movements of one part of his body his left foot hence the title he learned to write and draw by holding a piece of chalk between his toes and went on to become a painter and a published novelist and poet life in working-class dublin in the thirties and forties could be hard and the city jim sheridan himself a dubliner shows us here is in many ways a grim grey cheerless place very different from our normal idea of the emerald isle sheridan and day-lewis were later to collaborate on another film with an irish theme in the name of the father against this however must be set the cheerfulness and spirit of its people especially the brown family much of christys success was due to the support he received from his parents who refused to allow him to be institutionalised and always believed in the intelligence hidden beneath a crippled exterior and from his siblings we see how his brothers used to wheel him round in a specially-made cart and how they helped their bricklayer father to build christy a room of his own in their back yard the film could easily have slid into sentimentality and ended up as just another heart-warming triumph over adversity movie that it does not is due to a number of factors principally the magnificent acting in the course of his career day-lewis has given a number of fine performances but this together with the recent there will be blood is his best he is never less than 100% convincing as christie; his tortured jerky movements and strained attempts at speech persuade us that we really are watching a disabled person even though intellectually we are well aware that day-lewis is able-bodied the other performances which stand out are from fiona shaw as his mentor dr eileen cole from hugh oconor as the young christy and from brenda fricker as christys mother which won her the best supporting actress award the other reason why the film escapes sentimentality is that it does not try to sentimentalise its main character christy brown had a difficult life but he could also be difficult to live with and the film gives us a warts and all portrait he was a heavy drinker given to foul language and prone to outbursts of rage he could also be selfish and manipulative of those around him and the film shows us all these aspects of his character of course it also shows us the positive aspects- his courage his determination and his wicked sense of humour day-lewiss acting is not just physically convincing in that it persuades us to believe in his characters disability but also emotionally and intellectually convincing in that it brings out all these different facets of christys character his oscar was won in the teeth of some very strong opposition from the likes of robin williams and kenneth branagh but it was well deserved 810<SEP>1
hollywoods misguided obsession with sequels has resulted in more misfires than hits for every godfather ii there are dozens of more american graffitis stayin alives and grease 2s while the original grease is not a great film the 1977 adaptation of the long-running broadway hit does have songs evocative of the 1960s energetic choreography and an appealing cast when paramount began work on a follow-up the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbusterfortunately for moviegoers michelle pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before signing contracts her talent and beauty were already evident herein and pfeiffer does seem to express embarrassment at the humiliating dance routines and tuneless songs that she is forced to perform maxwell caulfield however lacks even the skill to express embarrassment and his emotions run the gamut from numb to catatonic what romantic interest beyond hormones could the cool sassy pfeiffer have in the deadpan caulfield that dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fades into a bad memory only cameos by veterans such as eve arden connie stevens and sid caesar have any wit although lorna luft does rise slightly above the lame materialreviewers have complained that because grease 2 is always compared to the original the movie comes up lacking however even taken on its own terms the film is a clunker after a frenetic opening number which evidently exhausted the entire cast the energy dissipates with few exceptions the original songs bear little resemblance to the early 1960s and the only nostalgia evoked is for our miss brooks and sid caesars comedy hour the jokes fall flat and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer patricia birch is clumsy to be polite however worse films have been inflicted on audiences and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from rehashing blockbusters unfortunately grease 2 is not even unintentionally funny instead the film holds the viewers attention like a bad train wreck just when all the bodies seem to have been recovered the next scene plunges into even worse carnage<SEP>0
i was raised watching the original batman animated series and am an avid batman graphic novel collector with a comic book hero as iconic as batman there are certain traits that cannot be changed creative liberties are all well and good but when it completely changes the character then it is too far i purchased one of the seasons of the batman in the hopes that an extra bonus feature could shed some light on the creators reasoning for making this show such an atrocity in an interview on the making of the batman one of the artists or writers im unsure which said that we felt we shouldnt mess with batman but we could mess with the villains so they proceeded to make the joker into an immature little kid begging for attention the penguin into some anime knockoff mr freeze into a super-powered jewel thief poison ivy into a teenage hippie and countless other shameful acts which are making bob kane roll over in his grave to sum it all up: i wish i had more hands so i could give this show four thumbs down it squeezes by my rating with a 2 out of 10 simply because it uses the batman name warner brosrethink this! please!<SEP>0

still a sucker for pyuns esthetic sense i liked this movie though the unfinished ending was a let-down as usual pyun develops a warped sense of humour and kathy longs fights are extremely impressive beautifully photographed this has the feel it was done for the big screen<SEP>0

yesterday my spanish catalan wife and myself saw this emotional lesson in history spain is going into the direction of political confrontation again that is why this masterpiece should be shown in all spanish high schools it is a tremendous lesson in the hidden criminality of fascism the american pilot who gets involved in the spanish civil war chooses for the democratically elected republican government the criminal role of religion is surprisingly well shown in one of the most inventive scenes that uribe ever made the colors are magnificent the cruelty of a war could anybody tell me the difference between any war and a civil war is used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other the cowards that start their abuse of power even towards innocent children are now active again a film like el viaje de carol carols journey tells one of the so many sad stories of the 20th century it is a better lesson in history than any book could contain again great work from the peninsula iberica !<SEP>1
although i have enjoyed bing crosby in other movies i find this movie to be particularly grating maybe because im from a different era and a different country but i found crosbys continual references to the good old usa pleasant at first trite after a while and then finally annoying dont get me wrong - im not anti-american whatsoever - but it seemed that the english could do no right andor needed this brave oh so smart american visitor to show them the way its a fish out of water story but unlike most movies of this sort this time its the fish who has the upper hand to be fair to both myself and the movie i have watched it a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression each timei watched another crosby movie last night - the emperors waltz - and that too produced the same reaction in me and to my surprise even my wife - who for whats its worth is american - found the in your face attitude of american crosby to be irritating one too many references to teddy roosevelt as she put it as for the premise of the movie its unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good the scenery and the music is also good as are the great costumes - although i agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on william bendix looks horrid picture moe of the three stoogesall in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of bing crosby but because he is in virtually every shot its pretty hard to sit through this movie<SEP>0
its interesting how 90% of the high-vote reviews are all comprised of *random username* from united states no state pride who all say more or less the exact same thing with the exact same grammatical style and all with the exact same complete lack of taste in movies i would delve further into this suspicious trend but alas this is a review of the movie and not the reviews themselveslet me start by saying that i am both a christian and a true avid movie fan this means i have seen a great many movies from good to bad and can wholeheartedly claim that facing the giants is in fact not a good movie it has good intentions but fails to meet many if any basic standards that i associate with a quality filmgoing experiencethe acting: mostly terrible palatable at best hearing that most were apparently volunteers does not at all surprise methe dialogue: clumsy cheesy the script comes off as a long version of some cheesy skit youd see performed in sunday school or youth group function the rave review robots revel in the absence of meaningless words but the cold hard truth is that such words are a part of the real world and the complete absence of it is palpable lets just say the mean ol head coach of a team in a state championship game would have a lot more to say than oh no! when things are not going his waythe plot: mind-bogglingly predictable it has been commented that this movie is not a hollywood cliché and yet its like it was pulled directly from making an underdog sports movie for dummies including the mandatory quasi-romantic subplot for the ladies and just had a christian-themed coat of paint slapped on it im not lying or bragging when i say i had almost every major detail in both the plot and subplot pegged immediately upon their inception only someone who has never seen a decent sports movie in their whole life would be emotionally stirred by the story presented herethe directingediting: it too was patterned almost exactly after the generic underdog sports movie template still acting aside there werent many noticeable goofs so at least facing the giants was technically competentthe message: ask jesus and he will grant all your wishes part of me hoped that this movie would end in the teams eventual defeat to really emphasize the whole if we lose we praise you part because in the real world you will fail at one point or another and its good to be prepared for that but in the world of facing the giants if you fail clearly someone either screwed up or is cheating another interesting question being what if the eagles came across another team that had gotten religion would they be caught in an endless loop of miraculous plays and last-minute saves or would the universe simply have exploded the bottom line: for the hardcore conservative christian parents crowd lamenting the evils of hollywood facing the giants will be another mediocre-at-best christian film to hold up on a pedestal as the preferred model for modern film-making for everyone else the effects will range from boredom to a burning desire to be watching something else and a warning: any attempt to show this to non-christians will lead not to conversion but to derision i give this two stars one for the one scene that did not have me rolling my eyes and another for basic technical proficiency on a low budget<SEP>0
this move reminded my of tales from the crypt keeper it has the same sort of idea of people get what they deserve i think thats always the them in a crypt story the same goes for the bad acting very bad acting i enjoyed the movie knowing that most people didnt like it and i wasnt expecting much whenever i watch a stephen king movie i dont expect much because all his movies are awful compared to the genius of his novels i have read the shining and carrie and they were great books i love how carrie played out like it was a true story and the whole book is a bunch of reports and theories and such it was so good but i noticed that both of the novels were nothing like the movies the endings were very different then the movie versions i assume from those two novels that all of his novels are changed greatly and the endings are always cheesy i ending of thinner is the worst so cheesy i want to read the book to find out the real ending i suggest everyone who intends to read stephen kings novels to watch his movies before hand so that you may compare and that way you will be greatly satisfied in the book i intend on doing so with all his novels that were made into movies im sure if they were made into movies they were real good books and the screenplay went terribly wrong<SEP>0
just cause is a flawed but decent film held together by strong performances and some creative though exceedingly predictable writing sean connery is an anti-death penalty crusader brought in to save a seemingly innocent young black man blair underwood from the ultimate penalty to set things right connery ventures to the scene of the crime where he must contend not only with the passage of time but a meddling sheriff laurence fishbourne twists and turns and role reversals abound -- some surprising some not -- as the aging crusader attempts to unravel the mystery the climactic ending is a bit ludicrous but just cause is worth a look on a slow night<SEP>1
this is a dry and sterile feature filming on one of most interesting events in wwii and in history of warfare behind the front line bad drama composition is worst about this film as plot on killing hitler suppose to be pretty dramatic event there is no character development at all and idea that tom cruise suppose to play a high rank commander that questions his deepest inner thoughts on patriotism and treason is completely insane i believe that mister bin would play it better generally speaking film pretty much looks as a cheep copy of good german tv movie stauffenberg from 2004 but cant get close to that film regarding any movie aspect whatsoever however movie obviously gets its financial goal with pop-corn audience that cherishes hollywood fast-mood blood and shallow art values<SEP>0
van dien must cringe with embarrassment at the memory of this ludicrously poor film as indeed must every single individual involved to be honest i am rather embarrassed to admit i watched it from start to finish production values are somewhere between the original series of crossroads and prisoner cell block h most five year olds would be able to come up with more realistic dialogue and a more plausible plot as for the acting performances if you can imagine the most rubbish porno you have ever seen - one of those ones where the action is padded out with some interminable story to explain how some pouting old peroxide blonde boiler has come to be getting spit-roasted by a couple of blokes with moustaches - you will have some idea of the standard of acting in maiden voyage worse still you cant even fast forward to the sex scenes because there arent any an appallingly dreadful film<SEP>0

ashanti is a very 70s sort of film 1979 to be precise it reminded me of the wild geese in a way richard burton richard harris and roger moore on a mission in africa its a very good film too and i enjoyed it a lotdavid michael caine is a doctor working in africa and is married to a beautiful ashanti woman called anansa beverley johnson who has trained in medicine in america and is also a doctor while theyre doctoring one day she is snatched by slavers working for an arabic slave trader called suleiman played perfectly by peter ustinov of all people the rest of the film is david trying to get her backmichael caine is a brilliant actor of course and plays a character who is very determined and prepared to do anything to get his wife back but rather hopeless with a gun and action stuff hes helped out first by a englishman campaigning against the slave trade that no one acknowledges is going on rex harrison! then briefly by a helicopter pilot william holden and then by an arab called malik kabir bedi malik has a score to settle with suleiman he is very intense throughout a very engaging character and so rides off with david to find him and get anansa back - this involves a wonderful scene in which david fails miserably to get on his camelthen theres lots of adventure theres also lots of morality-questioning the progress of the story is a little predictable from this point and there are a few liberties taken with plotting to move things along faster but its all pretty forgivable the question is will david get to anansa before peter ustinov sells her on to omar sharif yes of course omar sharif is in it!<SEP>1
someone should tell goldie hawn that her career as a teen-age gamin ended thirty years ago this is one of the worst films released in years an unequivocal disaster in which the two leads give themselves over to a frenetic exposition of their trademark tics in an effort to make up for a bad script and bad directing this thing should have been smothered at birthi hope john cleese got paid a lot for having his name attached to this disaster he is the only performer who came through this stinking mess more or less unscathed his only fault being a failure to realize that the rest of the cast would sink the picture<SEP>0
this movie is all about subtlety and the difficulty of navigating the ever-shifting limits of mores race relations and desire granted it is not a movie for everyone there are no car chases no buildings exploding no murders the drama lies in the tension suggested by glances minimal gestures spatial boundaries lighting and things left -- sometimes very ostensibly -- unsaid its about identity memory community belonging the different parts of the movie work together to reinforce the leitmotifs of self and other identity desire limits and loss it will reward the attentive and sensitive viewer it will displease those whose palates require explosive massive spicy action it is a beautifully filmed human story that is all<SEP>1
!!!! possible mild spoiler !!!!!as i watched the first half of guilty as sin i couldn`t believe it was made in 1993 because it played like a jagged edge joe eszterhas clone from the mid 80s it starts with a murder and it`s left for the audience to muse is he guilty or innocent and will he go to bed with his attorney but halfway through the film shows its early 90s credentials by turning into a lawyer gets manipulated and stalked by her client type film which ends in a ridiculous manner and guilty as sin has an even more ridiculous ending in this respect this is a very poor thriller but the most unforgivable thing about it is that it was directed by sidney lumet the same man who brought us the all time classic court room drama 12 angry men<SEP>0
*spoilers and extreme bashing lay ahead*when this show first started i found it tolerable and fun fairly oddparents was the kind of cartoon that kids and adults liked it also had high ratings along with spongebob but it started to fall because of the following crap that butch hartman and his team shoved into the showfirst off toilet humor isnt all that funny you can easily pull off a fast laugh from a little kiddie with a burp but thats pretty much the only audience that would laugh at such a cliché joke next there are the kiddie jokes lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people cross-dressing lololol!!! i just cant stop laughing at such gay bliss! somebody help me! but of course this show wouldnt suck that bad if it werent for stereotypes did you see how the team portrayed australians they saw them as nothing but kangaroo-loving boomerang-throwing simpletons who live in a hot desert but now is the coup de grace of why this show truly sucks the loudest of them all over-used jokes!!! the show constantly pulls up the same jokes the majority of them being unfunny thinking it is like the greatest thing ever! cosmo is mostly the one to blame i hated how they kept on mentioning super toilet which also has a blend of kiddish humor in it just as well and cosmo would freak out and who could forget that dumb battery ram joke that every goddamn parent in dimmsdale would use in that one e-mail episode you know the one in which every single parent oblivious to other parents saying it would utter the exact same sentence before breaking into their kids room yes it may be first class humor to some people but it is pure s*** to othersif im not mistaken i do believe butch hartman said something about ending the show thank god! everyone around my area says its like the funniest nickelodeon show ever i just cant agree with it i think its just another pile of horse dung that we get on our cartoon stations everyday only worse<SEP>0

this has to be the funniest stand up comedy i have ever seen eddie izzard is a genius he picks in brits americans and everyone in between his style is completely natural and completely hilarious i doubt that anyone could sit through this and not laugh their a** off watch enjoy its funny<SEP>1
nolls comfortable way of rolling out blunt comments often with expletives to describe things that he is more knowledgeable about than most is quite refreshing there is one other character in the film that constantly tries to verbalize complicated issues using more language than necessary this guy should never have been given a thesaurus cut to noll and you know youre in for a treat!the way the pioneers of big wave surfing are portrayed is very evocative of a lost era nevermind the fact that no one knows how these guys made a living much less took care of issues like medical care the use of old film clips throughout was masterfully done<SEP>1
theyre showing this on some off-network its well crap while it is not as bad as the b-movies they show on the sci-fi network on saturdays but still a fairly large pile of crap the acting is passable the plot and writing are fairly sub-standard and the pacing is entirely too slow every minute of the movie feels like the part of the movie where theyre wrapping things up before the credits - not the peak of the movie the denouement also large portions of the cast look way to old for the age range theyre playing the whole thing is predictable boring and not worthy of being watched save your time its not even worth the time it takes to watch it for free<SEP>0
blazing saddles! its a fight between two estranged brothers dennis quaid and arliss howard both of whom can ignite fires mentally; they square off over childhood differences with dippy love-interest debra winger caught in the middle director glenn gordon caron the tv whiz-kid behind moonlighting smothers the darkly-textured comedy in vince gilligans screenplay with a presentation so slick the movie resembles an entry from an over-enthusiastic film student on a fifteen million-dollar grant it has the prickly energy of a big commercial feature but a shapeless style which brings out nothing from the characters except their kooky eccentricities these arent even characters theyre plot functions barely-released to theaters the film is a disaster although strictly as an example of style over substance it does look good winger is the only stand-out in a cast which looks truly perplexed *12 from ****<SEP>0
encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film bad mistake ive seen 950+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - its awful in almost every way: editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack the films only song - a lame country tune - is played no less than four times the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film the only thing that prevents me giving this a 1-score is harvey keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort one for keitel obsessives only<SEP>0

thats the sound of stan and ollie spinning in their gravesi wont bother listing the fundamental flaws of this movie as theyre so obvious they go without saying small things like this being the all new adventures of laurel and hardy despite the stars being dead for over thirty years when it was made little things like that a bad idea would be to have actors playing buffoons whom just happen to be called laurel and hardy as bad as that is it might have worked for a really bad idea try casting two actors to impersonate the duo okay they might claim to be nephews but the end result is the samebronson pinchot can be funny okay forget his wacky foreigner cousin larry schtick in perfect strangers and look at him in true romance here though he stinks its probably not all his fault and like the director and the support cast - all of who are better than the material - he was probably just desperate for money there are those who claim americans find it difficult to master an effective english accent this cause is not helped here by pinchot what is stan welsh iranian pakistani only in stans trademark yelp does he come close though as the yelp is overdone to the point of tedium thats nothing to write home about gailard sartain does slightly better as ollie though its like saying whats worse - stepping in dog dirt or a kick in the knackers remember the originals with their split-second timing intuitive teamwork and innate loveability well thats absent altogether replaced with two stupid old men and jokes so mistimed you could park a bus through the gaps whereas the originals had plots that could be summed up in a couple of panels this one has some long-winded mummy hokum and what a lousy title! thats mixed in with the boys fraternity scenario i cant claim to have seen every single one of laurel and hardys 108 movies but i think its a safe bet that even their nadir was leagues ahead of thismaybe the major problem is that the originals were sort-of playing themselves or at least using their own accents it at least felt natural and unforced as opposed to the contrived caricatures pinchot and sartain are given and since when did stan do malapropisms and so many at that i was gonna give you a standing cremation; i would like to marinate my friend stop it! only notable moment is a reference to bozo the clown the cartoon character who shared larry harmons l & h comic harmon of course bought the name copyright how disconcerting to see a ® after laurel and hardy and was co-director and producer of this travesty questions abound would stan and ollie do fart gags if they were alive today would they glass mummies with broken bottles have stan being smacked in the genitals with a spear and end on a big cgi-finale lets hope noti did laugh once but i think that was just in disbelief at how terrible it all is why was this film made in the first place who did the makers think would like it possibly the worst movie ive ever seen an absolute abhorrence i grew sick of watching after just the first five minutes about as much fun as having your head trapped in a vice while a red-hot poker and stinging nettles are forcibly inserted up your back passage<SEP>0
judy holliday struck gold in 1950 withe george cukors film version of born yesterday and from that point forward her career consisted of trying to find material good enough to allow her to strike gold againit never happened in it should happen to you i cant think of a blander title by the way holliday does yet one more variation on the dumb blonde whos maybe not so dumb after all but everything about this movie feels warmed over and half hearted even jack lemmon in what i believe was his first film role cant muster up enough energy to enliven this recycled comedy the audience knows how the movie will end virtually from the beginning so mostly it just sits around waiting for the film to catch upmaybe if youre enamored of holliday youll enjoy this; otherwise i wouldnt bothergrade: c<SEP>0
this is one of the weakest soft porn film around i cant believe somebody wrote this stupid story before making some changes the guy mike is a major wimp and moron i cant believe he didnt want to take a shower with his bride-to-be toni and be in a threesome with the french photographer jan he does do a threesome with toni and kristi but that was short i hate that every time in soft core porn films threesomes between a woman a man and a woman is short but a girl-girl thing is about an hour to the makers of these films have the threesomes alot longer this film shouldve have two threesome scenes not one but two<SEP>0
lets face it: the final season #8 was one of the worst seasons in any show ive ever enjoyed mostly ive never found dry spells to last a whole season but if you judge this show by the last season of course its going to come across as inferior that is an entirely unfair assessment-- because that 70s show was in its day a brilliant and hilarious sitcom about a bygone era and how the people who lived there werent so different than we are here in modern timesall right ignoring season 8topher grace stars as eric forman a horny geek of a teenager with a perpetual love of donna laura prepon the feminist girl next door playing their friends danny masterson hyde mila kunis jackie wilmer valderrama fez and even ashton kutcher kelso give fantastic performances in almost every episode the best one is probably fez a foreign exchange student who is as mentally promiscuous as they get what country is he from try to figure it out! for another dimension of entertainment debra jo rupp and kurtwood smith are phenomenal as erics parents rupp as kitty is both formidable and sweet sort of like mrs brady meets marie barone while smiths red exists mainly to scare the pogees out of everyone don stark and tanya roberts play very well opposite each other as donnas parents the chauvinistic but likable bob and the airheaded midge tommy chong has occasional appearances as leo a stoner who acts as a father figure to hydeapart from the anachronistic errors that pop up quite frequently and the over-the-top lessons that sometimes come and that deplorable final season 70s is a terrific show with amazing writing spot-on direction and a feel-good vibe pulsing through every episode theyre all alright<SEP>1
the first half hour or so of this movie i liked the obvious budding romance between ingrid bergman and mel ferrer was cute to watch and i wanted to see the inevitable happen between them however once the action switched to the home of ingrids fiancé it all completely fell apart instead of romance and charm we see some excruciatingly dopey parallel characters emerge who ruin the film the fiancés boorish son and the military attachés vying for the maids attention looked stupid--sort of like a subplot from an old love boat episode how the charm and elegance of the first portion of the film can give way to dopiness is beyond me this film is an obvious attempt by renoir to recapture the success he had with the rules of the game as the movie is very similar once the action switches to the country estate just as in the other film i was not a huge fan of the rules of the game but elena and her men had me appreciating the artistry and nuances of the original film<SEP>0
at the name of pinter every knee shall bow - especially after his nobel literature prize acceptance speech which did little more than regurgitate canned by-the-numbers sixth-form anti-americanism but this is even worse; not only is it a tour-de-force of talentlessness a superb example of how to get away with coasting on your decades-old reputation but it also represents the butchery of a superb piece the original sleuth was a masterpiece of its kind yes it was a theatrical confection and it is easy to see how its central plot device would work better on the stage than the screen but it still worked terrifically well this is a michael caine vanity piece but lets face it caine is no olivier not only can he not fill larrys shoes he couldnt even fill his bathroom slippers the appropriately-named caine is after all a distinctly average actor whose only real recommendation like so many british actors is their longevity in the business he was a good harry palmer excellent in get carter but thats yer lot mate! give this a very wide berth and stick to the superb original this is more of a half-pinter<SEP>0

this anime series starts out great: interesting story exciting events interesting characters beautifully rendered and executed not everything is explained right away dangling a proverbial carrot before the viewer enticing the viewer to watch each succeeding episode but imagine the disappointment to find that the sci-fi thrillergiant robot adventure is only a backdrop for psycho-babble and quasi-religious preachy exploitation if you want to hear youre ok its good to be you after being embattled with negative slogans and the characters negative emotions then this is for you if you want a good sci-fi flick that is simply fun to watch forget this one both the original and the alternate endings were grossly disappointing to me all that and this movie was too preachy<SEP>0
its wonderful to see that shane meadows is already exerting international influence - les convoyeurs attendant shares many themes with a room for romeo brass: the vague class identity above working but well below middle the unhinged father the abandoned urban milieu the sense of adult failure the barely concealed fascism underpinning modern urban life but if meadows is an expert formalist mariage trades in images and his coolly composed exquisitely surreal monochrome frames serve to distance the grimy and rather bleak subject matter which meadows-like veers from high farce to tragedy within seconds there are longueurs and cliches but poelvoorde is compellingly mad an ordinary man with ordinary ambitions whose attempts to realise them are hatstand dangerous; while individual set-pieces - the popcornpidgeon explosions; the best marriage sequence since the dead and the deadly - manage to snatch epiphany from despair<SEP>1
first be warned that i saw this movie on tv and with dubbed english - which may have entirely spoiled the atmosphere however ill rate what i saw and hope that will steer people away from that version i found this movie excruciatingly dull all the movies atmosphere is lost with dubbing leaving the slow frustration of a stalker movie im sorry but the worst movie sin in my book is to be slow except when the movie about philosophy i didnt see any deep philosophical meaning in this movie maybe i missed something but i have to tell it like i see it i rated it a 1 what can i say us oriented tastes maybe<SEP>0
the story of ned kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand and this film is no exception what ensures ned kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him during several battles he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce indeed it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the victorian police who noticed he hadnt plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged the story has been told in schools and histories of australia for so long that some permutations of the story have ironically become boring the more the stories try to portray kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster the less people pay attentionwhich is where this adaptation of our sunshine a novel about the kelly legend excels rather than attempting to portray a ned kelly who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore the film quickly establishes him as a human being indeed the reversal of the popular legend showing the corruption of the victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd here ned kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it no i am not making that up about the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the irish versus english mentality of the battles while the kelly gang were distinctly irish australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly a scene with some chinese migrants highlights thisheath ledger does an amazing job of impersonating australias most notorious outlaw it is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching ledger and not kelly himself orlando bloom has finally found a role in which he doesnt look completely lost without his bow and geoffrey rushs appearance as the leader of the police contingent at glenrowan goes to show why he is one of the most revered actors in that desolate little island state but it is naomi watts appearing as julia cook who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film although the film basically implies that cook was essentially the woman in ned kellys life but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here indeed a lot of the films hundred and ten minutes feels more freeze-dried than explorative once the element of police corruption is established in fact the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushedunfortunately most of the films strengths are not capitalised upon rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits ditto for watts and the rest of the cast come off a little like mannequins i can only conclude that another fifteen or even thirty minutes of footage might have fixed this but that leads to the other problem in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact one scene manages to do the speech-making thing well but unfortunately it all becomes a collage of moments with no linking after a while if one were to believe the impression that this film creates a matter of weeks even days passes between the time that ned kelly becomes a wanted man on the say-so of one corrupt policeman and the infamous shootout at glenrowan annoyingly the trial and execution of ned kelly is not even depicted here simply referred to in subtitles before the credits rollthat said aside from some shaky camera-work at times ned kelly manages to depict some exciting shootouts and it has a good beginning for that reason i rated it a seven out of ten other critics have not been so kind so if youre not impressed by shootouts with unusual elements and what could more more unusual than full body armour in a colonial shootout then you might be better off looking elsewhere especially if you want a more factual account of ned kellys life<SEP>1
at first glance it would seem natural to compare where the sidewalk ends with laura both have noirish qualities both were directed by otto preminger and both star dana andrews and gene tierney but thats where most of the comparisons end laura dealt with posh sophisticated people with means who just happen to find themselves mixed-up in a murder where the sidewalk ends is set in a completely different strata these are people with barely two nickels to rub together who are more accustomed to seeing the underbelly of society than going to fancy dress parties where the sidewalk ends is a gritty film filled with desperate people who solve their problems with their fists or some other weapon small-time hoods are a dime-a-dozen and cops routinely beat confessions out of the crooks getting caught-up in a murder investigation seems as natural as breathingwhile i havent seen his entire body of work based on what i have seen dana andrews gives one of his best performances as the beat-down cop det sgt mark dixon hes the kind of cop who is used to roughing up the local hoods if it gets him information or a confession one night he goes too far and accidentally kills a man he does his best to cover it up but things get complicated when he falls for the dead mans wife morgan taylor tierney whose father becomes suspect number one in the murder case as morgans father means the world to her dixons got to do what he can to clear the old man without implicating himselftechnically where the sidewalk ends is outstanding besides the terrific performance from andrews the movie features the always delightful tierney she has a quality that can make even the bleakest of moments seem brighter the rest of the cast is just as solid with tom tully as the wrongly accused father being a real standout beyond the acting the direction sets lighting and cinematography are all top-notch overall its an amazingly well made filmif i have one complaint and admittedly its a very very minor quibble its that tierney is almost too perfect for the role and her surroundings its a little difficult to believe that a woman like that could find herself mixed-up with some of these unsavory characters its not really her fault its just the way tierney comes across she seems a little too beautiful polished and delicate for the part but her gentle kind trusting nature add a sense of needed realism to her portrayal<SEP>1
the penultimate episode of star treks third season is excellent and a highlight of the much maligned final season essentially spock mccoy and kirk beam down to sarpeidon to find the planets population completely missing except for the presence of a giant library and mr atoz the librarian all 3 trek characters soon accidentally walk into a time travel machine into different periods of sarpeidons past spock gives a convincing performance as an ice age vulcan who falls in love for zarabeth while kirk reprises his unhappy experience with time travel--see the city on the edge of forever--when he is accused of witchcraft and jailed before escaping and finding the doorway back in time to sarpeidons present in the end all 3 trek characters are saved mere minutes before the beta niobe star around sarpeidon goes supernova the enterprise warps away just as the star explodesironically as william shatner notes in his book star trek memories this show was the source of some dispute since leonard nimoy noticed that no reason was given in lisettes script for the reason why spock was behaving in such an emotional way nimoy relayed his misgivings here directly to the shows executive producer fred freiberger that vulcans werent supposed to fall in love p272 however freiberger reasoned the ice age setting allowed spock to experience emotions since this was a time when vulcans still had not evolved into their completely logical present state this was a great example of improvisation on freibergers part to save a script which was far above average for this particular episode while shatner notes that the decline in script quality for the third season hurt spock artistically since his character was forced to bray like a donkey in platos stepchildren play music with hippies in the way to eden or sometimes display emotion the script here was more believable spocks acting here was excellent as freiberger candidly admitted to shatner p272 the only obvious plot hole is the fact that since both spock and mccoy travelled thousands of years back in time mccoy too should have reverted to a more primitive human state not just spock but this is a forgivable error considering the poor quality of many other season 3 shows the brilliant spockmccoy performance and the originality of this script who could have imagined that the present inhabitants of sarpeidon would escape their doomed planets fate by travelling into their past this is certainly what we came to expect from the best of classic trek--a genuinely inspired story shatner in memories named some of his best unusual and high quality shows of season 3 as the enterprise incident day of the dove is there in truth no beauty the tholian web and the children shall lead and the paradise syndrome p273 while my personal opinion is that and the children shall lead is a very poor episode while is there in truth no beauty is problematic all our yesterdays certainly belongs on the list of top season three star trek tos films i give a 9 out of 10 for all our yesterdays<SEP>1
whatever possessed guy ritchie to remake wertmullers film is incomprehensiblethis new film is a mess there was one other person in the audience when i saw it and she left about an hour into it i hope she demanded a refund the only reason i stayed through to the end was because ive never walked out of a moviebut i sat through this piece of junk thoroughly flabbergasted that madonna and ritchie could actually think they made a good film the dialogue is laughable the acting is atrocious and the only nice thing in this film is the scenery ritchie took linas movie and turned it into another blue lagoonthis is a film that you wouldnt even waste time watching late night on cinemax time is too precious to be wasted on crap like this<SEP>0
final score: 18 out of 10after seeing jay and silent bob strike back i must have been on a big eliza dushku kick when i rented this movie soul survivors is a junk psychological thriller dressed up like a trashy teen slasher flick - even to the point of having a masked killer stalk a cast of young up-and-comers like dushku wes bentley american beauty casey affleck drowning mona and likable star melissa sagemiller luke wilson is also in there ridiculously miscast as a priest the movie the brainchild of writerdirector stephen carpenter seems like a mutant offspring of open your eyes or vanilla sky and movies where a character and the audience is caught in a world of dillusion caused by an accidentdeath the movie keeps churning out perplexing images and leaves us in a state of confusion the entire running time until this alternate reality is finally resolved i dont think these movies are that entertaining- by their very nature- to begin with but ss is rock-bottom cheap trash cinema any way you slice it the visuals the script the acting and the attempt at any originality all are throwaway afterthoughts to movies like this plus its pg-13 so it doesnt even deliver the gore or t&a to sustain it as a guilty pleasure even the unrated version is tame i had heard that the movie contained some hot shower scene between dushku & sagemiller as the movie fell apart in front of me and all other entertainment seemed to be lost i found myself waiting patiently for the shower scene - at least i would get something out of this then it comes: the two girls get paint on their shirts they jump in the shower fully clothed and scrub it off thats it people thought this was hot soul survivors is one of those drop-dead boring movies that is so weak and inept that it is hard to have any feelings at all toward it it puts out nothing and is hardly worth writing about in the end it leaves us empty carpenters finale is a mess of flashing light and pounding sound and thats probably the most lively part it will no doubt be making the rounds as a late night staple on usa or the sci-fi channel due to its low cost and pg-13 rating - and thats probably best for it<SEP>0
i loved this movie it was almost the same as the first cabin by the lake only instead of just killing women he kills men also and the scenes are much more interesting 2 of my favorite scenes are firstly when stanley and allison are in the dance club and he is describing kimberlys last moments before she is thrown to the water and secondly when stanley is visiting allison in his basement right before they head down to the set when she kisses him those scenes for me were very intense and riveting i gave the movie a rating of 810 not because the movie was bad but because the filming was bad i mean there were times when youd notice nothing was wrong like its being shot the way a film is usually shot you wouldnt see the live camera shooting but then very little you would notice the filming mistakes what went wrong<SEP>1
theo robertson has commented that waw didnt adequately cover the conditions after wwi which lead to hitlers rise and wwiiperhaps he missed the first one and a quarter hours of volume 8 covers this period and together with the earlier volumes in the series shows clearly the existing conditions i feel a friend of mine grew up in germany during this period joined the hitler youth even and his experiences were very similar to that mentioned in wawthis documentary is so far above the history channels documentaries i also own that there is no comparisonthe only fault and it is a small one that i have with waw is this: the numbers are not included many times for instance if youre talking about lend-lease then how much war material was lentleased how much to russia how much to britian how many merchant ships did the u-boats sink and when how many ships did the german or japanese navy have total in 1941 what type were they how many troops how many troops did the allies have in total and by country lots of numbers could have made a lot of viewers nod off but i would have preferred more! and naturally i always want to see more military analysis like why didnt patton & clark trap the german army that was at cassini after they had it surrounded instead of racing monty to rome and letting it escape i dont think you can begin to understand war until youve seen some of these video segments on total war like the fire bombing of dresden its like trying to understand auschwitz etc before you see the clips of the death camps: you just cant wrap your head around it - its too unbelievableunknown at that time and of course unfilmed were the most egregious cruelties and inhumanities of the japanese including cannibalism read flyboys and some live vivisection of medical experimentation prisoners wo any anesthetic! dave<SEP>1
this is just flat out unwatchable if theres a story in here somewhere its so deeply buried beneath the horrid characters and jarring camera work thats its indiscernible theres a group of vampire hunters who go around doing their thing and the vampires they kill have little aliens inside of them they pop their heads out and talk like speedy gonzales if you can imagine a blood and gore covered alien sock puppet screaming in horror as a cowboy dude zaps it with a cattle prod well thats what you get here these folks are loud obnoxious violent and just extremely annoying then there are some anti-human humans who stand around in their cgi spaceship being so incredibly pompous that its impossible to take these folks make hillary clinton seem like a right-wing extremist in comparison theyre friends with some vampires or somethingwho caresthen theres the camera work remember how everybody hated the thousand-cuts-a-minute crap from the recent rolleball remake the folks who made this movie love that stuff theres enough of it in here for three really crappy nu-metal videos on mtvnuff said this thing smells in comparison dracula 3000 is a masterwork<SEP>0
this film has so little class in comparison to strangers on a train or even accidental meeting for that matter that despite plot similarities i wouldnt feel right in actually comparing this to either of them the yancy butler character came across as such a dopey dimwit i was too embarrassed for the writer and director to continue watchingi dont enjoy many lifetime movies but feel compelled to watch one every now and then in the interest of promoting harmony at home i often groan silently but this film caused me to protest out loud stand up leave the room and walk around the house mumbling to myself before i returned to my normally favorite chair to subject myself to more torturedean morgan rochester ny<SEP>0
this movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites the voices for the animals are wonderful sally field and michael j fox are both brilliant as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch but the real standout is don ameche as the old faithful golden retriever this movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults humorous and suspenseful and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry! happy tears!<SEP>1
the shows echoed bubbling sound effect used to put me to sleep a very soothing show i think i might have slept through the parts where there was danger or peril i had also heard that some set up shots for a show on sponge divers was shot in tarpon springs florida i would assume lloyd bridges never dove there i only remember the show in reruns and although it was never edge-of-the-seat exciting we would make up our own underwater episodes in the lake at my grandmothers house imagining the echoed bubbling sounds and narrating our adventures in our heads i thought flipper had better undersea action of course he had the advantage of being in his natural environment<SEP>0
saw a screener of this before last years award season didnt really know why they gave them out after the voting had ended but whatever maybe for exposure at the least but the movie was a convoluted mess sure some parts were funny in a black humor kind of way but none of the characters felt very real to me at all there was not one person that i could connect with and i think that is where it failed for me sure the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive towards scientology wow! what a grand idealets see if that already hasnt been mined to the point of futility the whole ordeal feels fake from the lighting the casting the screenplay to the horrible visual effectswhich is supposed to be intentional i can tell and so can everyone else no one is laughing with you though anyways i hope it makes it out for sale on dvd at least i wouldnt want a project that a lot of people obviously put a lot of effort into get completely unnoticed but its tripe either way boring tripe at that<SEP>0
this was one of the worst movies ive ever seen im still not sure if it was serious or just a satire one of those movies that uses every stupid who dunnit cliché they can think of arrrrghdon johnson was pretty good in it actually but otherwise it sucked it was over 10 years ago that i saw it but it still hurts and wont stop lingering in my brain the last line in the movie really sums up how stupid it is i wont ruin it for you should you want to tempt fate by viewing this movie but i garantee you a *nghya* moment at the end with a few in between if you have nothing better to do and you like to point and laugh then maybe it might be worth your while additionally if youre forced to go on a date with someone you really dont like suggest watching this movie together and theyll probably leave you alone after they see it thats a fair price to pay i guess<SEP>0
i give this five out of 10 all five marks are for hendrix who delivers a very decent set of his latter day material unfortunately the quality of the camera work and editing is verging on the appalling! we have countless full-face shots of hendrix where he could almost be doing anything taking a pee perhaps we dont see his hands on the guitar thats the point! also were given plenty shots of hendrix from behind there appears to be three cameras on hendrix but amateur fools operate all of them the guy in front of hendrix seems to be keen to wander his focus lazily about the stage as if hendrix on the guitar is a mere distraction while the guy behind is keener on zeroing in on a few chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work thats bleeding out the amps the sound recording is good thanks to wally heider interspersed on the tracks are clips of student losers protesting against vietnam etc on tracks like machine gun complete waste of film! if hendrix had lived even another two years berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the light of day as far as a complete official release goes the one gem it does contain is the incredible johnny b good but all in a pretty poor visual document of the great man and inferior to both woodstock and isle of wight<SEP>0
loved the movie i even liked most of the actors in it but for me ms davis very poor attempt at an accent and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as ms davis they would be laughed off the screeni really think she phoned this one in now if it had myrna loy or ingrid bergman playing the part of the wife i would have enjoyed it much morei guess i just dont get bette davis ive always thought of her as an actor that plays herself no matter what role shes in the possible exception is now voyagerim sure many of the other reviewers will explain in careful and i hope civil detail how i am totally wrong on this but ill continue to watch the movies shes in because i like the storieswritingsupporting casts but ill always be thinking of different actresses that could have done a better job<SEP>1
repugnant bronson thriller unfortunately its technically good and i gave it 410 but its so utterly vile that it would be inconceivable to call it entertainment far more disturbing than a typical slasher film<SEP>0
vampires sexy guys guns and some blood who could ask for more moon child delivers it all in one nicely packaged flick! gackt is the innocent sho - who befriends a vampire kei hyde their relationship grows with time but as sho ages keis immortality breaks his heart it doesnt help that they both fall in love with the same woman the special effects are pretty good considering the small budget its a touching story ripe with human emotions you will laugh cry laugh then cry some more even if you are not a fan of their music see this film it works great as a stand alone vampire movie9 out of 10<SEP>1
a well cast summary of a real event! well actually i wasnt there but i think this is how it may have been like i think there are two typically american standpoints evident in the film: communistophobia and parallels to adolf hitler these should be evident to most independent observers anyway boothe does a great performance and so do lots of other well-known actors the last twenty minutes of the film are unbearable - and i mean it! anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal thats why its so terrible - it all happened and it probably looked just like that but actually did that last scene on the air station really take place<SEP>1
time paradoxes are the devils snare for underemployed minds theyre fun to consider in a what if sort of way film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including star trek: first contact the back to the future trilogy bill and teds excellent adventure groundhog day and the stargate sg1 homage window of opportunity heinleins all you zombies was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first timein the case of terry gilliams excellent film 12 monkeys its hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re-think our conception of the film repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mindsome seeing the film for the first time will regard cole played by bruce willis as a schizophrenic most will see cole as a man disturbed by what adams describes as the continual wrenching of experience visited upon him by time travelunlike other time travel stories 12 monkeys is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past cole tells his psychiatrist railly madeleine stowe that time cannot be changed but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists after he has been sent back to 1996 in his own personal time-lineeven this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time-line universe in order to ensure that the time-line is not alteredcole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realised if thats the case time is like a fluid it always finds its own level or path irrespective of the external forces working on it it boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too muchif you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time as we see on board the plane at the end of the film then that means the future can be changed by manipulating past eventsor does it the film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematiciansbonus material on the dvd makes for very interesting viewing gilliam was under more than normal pressure to bring the film in under budget which is no particular surprise after the munchausen debacle and in light of his later attempt to film don quixote i would rate the making of documentary as one of the more interesting ive seen it certainly is no whitewash and accurately observes the difficulties and occasional conflict arising between the creative people involved gilliams description of the film as his 7½th release on account of the film being written by writers other than himself - and therefore not really his film - doesnt do the film itself justicebrad pitts portrayal of goines is curiously engaging although his character is not especially sympathetic watch for his slightly wall-eyed look in one of the scenes from the asylum its disturbing and distractingprobably a coincidence the louis armstrong song what a wonderful world was used at the end of both 12 monkeys and the final episode of the tv series of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy both the film and the tv series also featured british actor simon jones12 monkeys is a science fiction story that will entertain in the same way that the mental stimulation of a game of chess may entertain its not a mindless recreation thats for sure<SEP>1
film version of sandra bernhards one-woman off-broadway show is gaspingly pretentious sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting and fitfully funny her fans will say shes scathingly honest and that may be true but shes also shrill with an unapologetic in-your-face bravado that isnt well-suited to a film in this genre she doesnt want to make nice--and shes certainly not out to make friends--and thats always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way but even if you meet her halfway her material here is seriously lacking filmmaker nicolas roeg served as executive producer and though not directed by him the film does have his chilly detached signature style all over it bernhard co-wrote the show with director john boskovich; their oddest touch was in having all of sandras in-house audiences looking completely bored--a feeling many real viewers will most likely share *12 from ****<SEP>0
i am completely appalled to see that the average rating for this movie is 5210 for what affects me it is definitely one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i still keep wondering why i watched it until the end first of all the plot is totally hopeless and the acting truly awful i think that any totally unknown actress would have been better for the role than susan lucci; concerning mr kamar dels reyes i think it would have been a better choice for him to remain in his valley of the dolls to sum up it is total waste of timeand im trying to stay polite to avoid at any cost my rating is 1 and i still think it is well paid but since we cannot give a o<SEP>0
plague replaces femme fatale in this highly suspenseful noir shot in new orleans by director elia kazan kazan as always gets fine performances from his actors but also shows a visual flair for claustrophobic suspense with a combination of tight compositions and stunning single shot chase scenes a man entering the country illegally is killed after a card game it turns out he has a form of bubonic plague so it remains crucial not only to arrest the killers but to find an inoculate all those who have had contact city and health officials implement a plan of secrecy rather than alert the community for fear the culprits will flee the city and spread the disease a detective and an epidemiologist up against the clock form an uneasy alliance as they comb the waterfront employing their contrasting investigatory styles streets raises a huge ethical question about the publics right to know as the medical officer argues for a media blackout thus possibly creating a greater risk to the community regardless of outcome you still may find yourself second guessing the actions of the the films protagonist richard widmark as drclint reed and paul douglas as detective warren display short tempers and grudging respect for each other in their search for the killers barbera bel geddis as reeds wife has some good moments with widmark in some domestic scenes that bring the right touch of restful more than comic relief from the tensions of the desperate search amid the grim environs of the new orleans waterfront impressively lensed by cinematographer joe mcdonald zero mostel as a small time criminal is slimy and reprehensible but at times sympathetic walter jack palance as the skeletal blackie black death is simply outstanding with riveting intensity palance dominates every scene he is in not only with ample threat but disturbing charm as well in addition he displays a formidable athleticism that allows for a more suspenseful continuity especially in the films powerful final allegorical moments panic in the streets is probably kazans best non-brando film its tension filled suspensefully well paced and edited its ambient on locale setting lends a sense of heightened reality that allows kazan the flexibility to display his visual style beyond the movie stage and with panic he succeeds with aplomb<SEP>1
ive read most of the comments on this movie i have seen this movieand the whole prophecy series many times with family members of all ages we all enjoyed and it just made us meditate on what we already knew from reading and studying the bible about the rapture and end times no one got scared or traumatized like i have read on some posts the movie is just based on biblical facts i have seen a lot of end time movies tribulation armagedon and so on and by far this one is one of the best in presenting bible truths it may not have a lot of great special effects like todays movies but i believe it is a good witnessing tool this movie and its prophecy series can be seen free at this website higherpraisecom and judge for yourself blessings to all<SEP>1
the animation in this re-imagining of peter & the wolf is excellent but at 29 minutes the film is sleep inducing they should have called it peter & the snails because everything moves at a snails pace i couldnt even watch the film in one sitting - i had to watch it 15 minutes at a time and it was pure torturesave yourself 30 minutes - do not watch this film - and you will thank mei can only guess that the oscar nominating committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees unfortunately to vote for the winner in the best animated short short! category the voters will have to sit through the whole thing i already feel sorry for them - and must predict that theres no way this film will come close to winning<SEP>0
i do agree with everything calamine has said! and i dont always agree with people but what calamine has said is very true it is time for the girls to move on to better roles i would like to see them succeed very much as they were a very inspirational pair growing up and i would like to see them grow as people actresses and in their career as well as their personal life so producers please give the girls a chance to develop something that goes off the tangent a bit move them into a new direction that recognises them individually and their talents in many facets this movie that is being commented is not too bad but as i have seen further on in their movies their movies stay the same of typical plot and typography when in rome is good for audiences of younger generation but the adults who were kids when the twins were babies want to follow the twins in their successes and so hence i think we adults would like to see them make movies of different kinds maybe some that are like the sixth sense the hour chocolat that sort of movie - not saying to have just serious movies for them humour ones too yes but rather see them in different roles to what they have been playing in their more recent movies like this one and new york minute note: i am from australia so excuse my weird spelling like reognise with the s instead of z<SEP>0
how can this movie have a 55 this movie was a piece of skunk s**t first the actors were really bad i mean chainsaw charlie was so retarded because in the very beginning when he pokes his head into the wooden hut that happened to be about oh 1 quarter of an inch thick that really cheap as* flimsy piece of wood and he did not even think he could cut threw itsecond the person who did the set sucks as* at supplying things for them to build with the only good thing about this movie is the idea of this tv show bottom line do not waste your hard earned cash on this hunk of s**t they call a movierating:03<SEP>0
white noise had potential to be one of the most talked about movies since the exorcist i think seeing as evp is supposedly true it really had an easy passage to be a feared true fact not many movies come along that really instill fear into the minds of people like i said this movie could have but did not the movie degraded itself to a low class pg-13 scary movie nothing compared to the ring or the sixth sense by any means someone really needs to just take charge in the horror movie industry and just make a movie that not only makes us think but it makes us jump scream everything a horror movie should do im honestly sick of the pg-13 horror genre because its becoming a genre of its own we need the old days back the blood and gore days the freddy kruger the jason the mike myers days few movies can pull off a think about this mentality being so not scary so why try to pull it off a few good jumps in this movie amount to nothing but one of the stupidest endings in movie history with no resolution at alldont waste your money on this movie<SEP>0
in 1948 this was my all-time favorite movie betty grables costumes were so ravishing that i wanted to grow up to be her and dress like that douglas fairbanks jr was irresistible as the dashing hungarian officer silly and fluffy as this movie might appear at first when i was eight years old it seemed to me to say something important about relations between men and women i saw it again the other day; i was surprised to find that it still did<SEP>1
ruth gordon is one of the more sympathetic killers that columbo has ever had to deal with and the plot is ingenious all the way around this is one of the best columbo episodes ever mariette hartley and g d spradlin are excellent in their supporting roles and peter falk delivers a little something extra in his scenes with gordon<SEP>1
the vampire bat is definitely of interest being one of the early genre-setting horror films of the 1930s but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praisethe film is set in a european village sometime in the 19th century where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals there is a very similar feel to james whales frankenstein and this is compounded by the introduction of lionel atwills dr niemann character complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancementthe vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a red-herring by having suspicion fall on bat-loving village simpleton herman dwight frye thus providing the excuse for a torch-wielding mob to go on the rampage - as if they needed onethis is one of a trio of early horror films in which lional atwill and fay wray co-starred also doctor x and the mystery of the wax museum and like their other collaborations the film suffers from ill-advised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements taken in context though the vampire bat is still weak and derivativeall we are left with is a poor-quality frankenstein imitation with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink dracula fans but for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director frank strayer was doing the blondie films a few years later<SEP>0
this well conceived and carefully researched documentary outlines the appalling case of the chagos islanders who it shows between 1969 and 1971 were forcibly deported en masse from their homeland through the collusion of the british and american governments anglo-american policy makers chose to so act due to their perception that the islands would be strategically vital bases for controlling the indian ocean through the projection of aerial and naval power at a time during the cold war when most newly independent post-colonial states were moving away from the western orbit it seems british and american officials rather felt that allowing the islanders to decide the fate of the islands was not a viable option instead they chose to effect the wholesale forcible removal of the native population the film shows that no provision was made for the islanders at the point of their ejection and that from the dockside in mauritius where they were left the displaced chagossian community fell into three decades of privation and in these new circumstances beset by homesickness they suffered substantially accelerated rates of deathfollowing the passage of more than three decades however in recent months and years following the release of many utterly damning papers from britains public record office one rather suspects that there was some mistake and these papers were not supposed to have ever been made public resultant legal appeals by the chagossian community in exile have seen british courts consistently find in favour of the islanders and against the british state as such the astonishing and troubling conclusions drawn out in the film can only reasonably be seen as proved nevertheless the governments of great britain and the united states have thus far made no commitment to return the islands to what the courts have definitively concluded are the rightful inhabitants this is a very worthwhile film for anyone to see but it is an important one for britons and americans to watch to be silent in the face of these facts is to be complicit in a thoroughly ugly crime<SEP>1
the story-line was rather interesting but the characters were rather flat and at times too extreme in their thoughtsbehavior more extreme than necessary also i think something went wrong in the casting john turtorro doesnt really satisfy me playing a semi-autistic chess player not to speak of the italian player motives werent very much outlined either<SEP>1
a mess of genres but its mainly based on stephen chows genre mash-ups for its inspiration theres magic kung-fu college romance sports gangster action and some weepy melodrama for a topping the production is excellent and the pacing is fast so its easy to get past the many flaws in this filma baby is abandoned next to a basketball court a homeless man brings him to a shaolin monastery thats in the middle of a city along with a special kung fu manual that the homeless man somehow has but cant read the old monk teaches the boy but expires when he tries to master the special technique in the manual the school is taken over by a phony kung fu master who is assisted by four wacky monks the new master gets mad at the now 20+ year old boy for not pretending to be hurt by the masters weak punches and throws him out for the night the boy is found throwing garbage into a basket from an incredible distance by a man who bring him to a gangsters club to play darts this leads to a big fight the boys expulsion from the monastery and the mans decision to turn the boy into a college basketball sensational this happens in the first 20 minutes with most of it happening in the first 10 minutes aside from the extreme shorthand storytelling the first problem is how little we get to know the main character until way into the movie the man who uses the boy is more sharply defined by the time the first third is over the plot follows no new ground except for the insane action climax of the film im sure you can easily imagine how the wacky monks will show up towards the end the effects photography and stunt work are all top- notch and make up for the uninspired plot stephen chow has a much better command of plot and comedy writing and this film will live in his shadow but thats not a good reason to ignore it its quite entertaining even with a scatter-shot ending recommended<SEP>1
my super x-girlfriend is one hell of a roller coaster ride the special effects were excellent and the costumes uma thurman wore were hubba buba uma thurman is an underrated comedic actress but she proved everyone wrong and nailed her role as the lunatic girlfriend she was just simply fabulous!!! luke wilson was also good as the average joe but he was a brave man to work with one of the greatest actresses of all time the supporting cast was also superb especially anna faris who was extremely good a lot better than in the scary movie franchiseivan rietman did very well in directing this film because if it wasnt for him and uma thurman this film wouldnt have done so well this film is clearly a 1010 for its cast uma thurman its director its screenplay and from its original plot line this film is very highly recommended<SEP>1
he only gets third billing behind arthur treacher & virginia field but this was effectively david nivens first starring role and hes charmingly silly as p g wodehouses dunderheaded bertie wooster master in name only to jeeves that most unflappable of valets as an adaptation its more like a watered-down the 39 steps than a true wodehousian outing and thats too bad since the interplay between treacher & niven isnt too far off the mark alas the b movie mystery tropes & forced comedy grow wearisome even at a brief 57 minutes next years follow-up step lively jeeves was even more off the mark with no bertie in sight and jeeves of all people! forced to play the goof<SEP>0
like most people i love a christmas story i had never even heard of this film and perhaps for good reason--it is awful same locale same narrator same director but the warm fuzziness of the original was lacking charles grodin was a poor choice to replace darrin mcgavin but i cannot imagine anyone being able to replace him the story seems forced and lacks the sweetness of the original the interaction with the neighbors the bumpuses is ridiculous in a christmas story ralphies obsession with the bb gun seems cute but his obsession in this movie is boring scud farkus the original neighborhood bully is replaced in this film by yet another kid with braces and a weird hat but with little of the scud farkus menacing appeal it would be pretty difficult to equal the original even if this movie had been made with the original crew<SEP>0
every now and then there gets released this movie no one has ever heard of and got shot in a very short time with very little money and resource but everybody goes crazy about and turns out to be a surprisingly great one this also happened in the 50s with quite a few little movies that not a lot of people have ever heard of there are really some unknown great surprising little jewels from the 50s that are worth digging out panic in the streets is another movie like that that springs to the mind both are movies that arent really like the usual genre flicks from their time and are also made with limited resourcesi was really surprised at how much i ended up liking this movie it was truly a movie that got better and better as it progressed like all old movies it tends to begin sort of slow but once you get into the story and its characters youre in for a real treat with this moviethe movie has a really great story that involves espionage though the movie doesnt start of like that it begins as this typical crime-thriller with a touch of film-noir to it but pickup on south street just isnt really a movie by the numbers so it starts to take its own directions pretty soon on it ensures that the movie remains a surprising but above all also really refreshing one to watchi also really liked the characters within this movie none of them are really good guys and they all of their flaws and weaknesses really humane it also especially features a great performance from thelma ritter who even received a well deserved oscar nomination for it has really got to be one of the greatest female roles i have ever seeneven despite its somewhat obvious low budget this is simply one great original special little movie that deserves to be seen by more!1010<SEP>1
sidney young pegg moves from england to new york to work for the popular magazine sharpes in a hope to live his dream lifestyle but struggles to make a lasting impressionbased on toby youngs book about survival in american business this comedy drama received mixed views from critiques labelled as inconsistently funny but with charm by the actors how to lose friends seemed as a run of the mill fish out of the pond make fun at another culture comedy but it isntthis 2008 picture works on account of its actors and the simple yet sharp story we start off in the past then in the present and are working our way forwards to see how young made his mark at one of americas top magazinespegg hot fuzz is too likable for words whether its hitting zombies with a cricket bat or showing his sidekick the nature of the law the english actor brings a charm and light heartedness to every scene here when the scripting is good but far from his own standards he brings a great deal of energy to the picture and he alone is worth watching for his antics with babe 3 are unforgivable simply breathtaking stuff as is his over exuberant dancing but he pulls it off splendidlybridges and anderson do well at portraying the stereotypical magazine bosses where dunst fits in nicely to the confused love interest megan fox who stole transformers reminds everyone she can act here with a funny hyperbole of a stereotype film star the fact that her character sophie myles is starring in a picture about mother teresa is as laughable as her characters antics in the pool to emphasize the point there is a dog and pegg rounds that off in true brit style comedy with a great little twistthough a british film there is an adaptation of american lifestyle for young as he tries to fit in and we can see the different approaches to story telling young wants the down right dirty contrasted with the american professionalism the inclusion of modern day tabloid stars will soon make this film dated but the concept of exploitation of film stars gives this edgeweides first picture is not perfect there are lapses in concentration as the plot becomes too soapy with an awkward obvious twist and there are too many characters to be necessary the physical comedy can also be overdone as a side note the bloopers on the dvd are some of the finest you will ever see which are almost half an hour longthis comedy drama has simon pegg on shining form again and with the collective approach to story telling and sharp comedy it is worth watching<SEP>1
those of the instant gratification era of horror films will no doubt complain about this films pace and lack of gratuitous effects and body count the fact is the empty acre is a good a example of how independent horror films should be doneif you avoid the indie racks because you are tired of annoying teens or twenty somethings getting killed by some baddie whose back-story could have come off the back of a count chocula box the empty acre is the movie for youset in the decaying remnants of the rural american dream the empty acre is the tale of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six-month-old baby as the couples weak relationship falls apart a larger story plays out in the background at night a shapeless dark mass seethes from a sun baked barren acre on their farm and seemingly devours anything in its path leaving no sign that it was ever therethe film is loaded with enigmatic characters and visual clues as to what is happening and ends with a well executed ending that resonates with just enough left over questions to validate the writerdirectors faith in an intellectual audiencethere seems to be a sub-text concerning the death of the american dream but i would hardly call the film an allegory riveting well acted and technically astute the empty acre is a fantastic little indie that thinking horror fans should love<SEP>1
this movie ive loved since i was young! its excellent although it may be a bit much for the average movie watcher if one cant interpret certain subtleties in the film for example our heros name is achilles and in the final battle between him and alexander hes shot in the heel with a rocket just as achilles in mythology was shot in his heel thats a just a little fact that is kind of amusing! anyway great movie good story itd be neat to see it redone with todays special effects! oddly enough gary graham had average success starring in the tv show alien nation this movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated!<SEP>1
silly simplistic and short gun crazy volume 1: a woman from nowhere goes nowherethis brief just over sixty minutes tale isnt so much inspired by the classic spaghetti westerns as it is a rip-off of sam raimis the quick & the dead his admitted homage to the spaghetti westerns brought into a contemporary setting in quick & dead sharon stones character seeks revenge against the dastardly sheriff played by gene hackman who when she was but an urchin placed the fate of her father a brief cameo by gary sinise in her hands; she accidentally shot him through the head in gun crazy saki played by the nimble ryoko yonekura seeks revenge against the dastardly mr tojo played with minimalist appeal by shingo tsurumi who when she was but an urchin placed the fate of her father in her hands; she let her foot slip off the clutch and dear ole dad was drawn and quartered by a semi truck the only significant difference despite the settings is the fact that tojo sadistically cripples saki with well i wont spoil that for you in case you decide to watch itin short saki  a pale imitation of the clint eastwoods man with no name  rides into the town  basically theres a auto shop and a tavern alongside an american military base so i guess that suffices for a town  corrupted by tojo the local crimelord with a ridiculously high price on his head for reasons never explained or explored confessing her true self as a bounty hunter saki takes on the local gunmen in shootouts whose choreography bares more than a passing similarity to the works of johnny to and john woo of course by the end of the film saki has endured her fair amount of torture at the hands of the bad guys but she rises to the occasion  on her knees in a laughable attempt at a surprise ending  and vanquishes all of her enemies with a rocket launcherdont ask where she gets the rocket launcher just watch it for yourself try not to laughthe image quality is average for the dvd release there is a grainy quality to several sequences but all in all this isnt a bad transfer the sound quality leaves a bit to the imagination at times but again it isnt a bad transferrather its a bad film<SEP>0
though the title may suggest examples of the 10 commandments it is a definitely incorrect assumption this is an adaptation of 9 seemingly unrelated stories from giovanni bocaccios 14th century decameron story collectionset within a medieval italian towns largely peasant population it is a diatribe on the reality of sex and its consequences within that world and time a realistic view of life within this world it sometimes feels like a journey back in timegiven the depicted human element of its time one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists - as well as the ironies of life at times or it may also be viewed as a general satire of the catholic churchs rulesnothing terribly special but definitely interesting if one comes with no expectations or assumptions<SEP>0
this movie is a half-documentaryand it is pretty interestingthis is a good moviebased on the true story of how a bunch of norwegian saboturs managed to stop the heavy water production in rukjan norway and the deliverance of the rest of the heavy water to germanythis movie isnt perfect and it could have been a bit better the best part of the movie is that some of the saboturs are played by themselves!!!if youre interested in history of wwii and film this is a movie thats worth a look!!<SEP>1
i have to say i was really looking forward on watching this film and finding some new life in it that would separate it from most dull and overly crafted mexican films i have no idea why but i trusted sexo pudor y lagrimas to be the one to inject freshness and confidence to our non-existent industry maybe it was because the soundtrackwhich i listened to before i saw the film sounded different from others maybe it was because it dared to include newer facesapart from demian bichir who is always a favorite of mexican film directors and supposedly dealed within its script with modern social behaviour maybe because its photography i saw in the trailers was bright and realistic instead of theatrical the film turned out to be a major crowd pleaser and a major letdown what serrano actually deals here with is the very old fashioned battle of the sexes as in all men are the same and why is it that all women; blahblahblah nothing new in it not even that it uses so much common ground and clichè that it eventually mocks itself without leaving any valuable reflexion on the femalemale condition full of usual tramps on the audience like safe gags about the clichès i talked about beforethose always work always and screaming performancesit is a well acted film in its contextand by screaming i mean literally the at first more compelling characters played by monica dionne and demian bichir turn out to be according to serrano the more pathetic ones i completely disagree with serrano they shouldnt have been treated that way only to serve as marionettes for his lesson to come throughhe made sure we got his message and completely destroyed their roles that were the only solid ground in which this story could have stood anyway it is after all a very entertaining film at times and you will probably have a good time seeing it if you accept to be manipulated by it<SEP>0
elegance and class are not always the first words that come to mind when folks at least folks who might do such a thing sit around and talk about film noir yet some of the best films of the genre out of the past the killers in a lonely place night and the city manage a level of sleek sophistication that elevates them beyond a moody catch phrase and its connotations of foreboding shadows fedoras and femme-fatales where the sidewalk ends a fairly difficult to find film -- the only copy in perhaps the best stocked video store in manhattan was a rough bootleg from the amc cable channel -- belongs in a category with these classicsfrom the moment the black cloud of opening credits pass a curtain is drawing around rogue loner detective marc dixons crumbling world and as the moments pass it inches ever closer threatening suffocation sure hes that familiar cop with a dark past but dana andrews gives dixon a bleak stare and troubled intensity that makes you as uncomfortable as he seems and yeah hes been smacking around suspects for too long and the newly promoted chief karl malden in a typically robust and commanding outing is warning him for the last time yet dixon hates these thugs too much to stop now and boy didnt they had have it coming hoods dusters mugs gutter nickel-rats he spits when that tough nut of a boss demotes him and rolls out all of the complaints the bureau has been receiving about dixons right hook the advice is for him to cool off for his own good but instead he takes matters into his own hands and what a world of trouble he finds when he relies on his instincts and falls back on a nature that may or may not have been passed down from a generation before right away hes in deep with the cops the syndicate his own partner dixons questionable involvement in a murder investigation threatens his job makes him wonder whether he is simply as base as those he has sworn to bring in like bogart in lonely place can he escape what he iswhen he has nowhere else to turn he discovers that he has virtually doomed his unexpected relationship with a seraphic beauty the marvelous gene tierney who seems as if she can turn his barren bachelors existence into something worth coming home to the pacing of this superb film is taut and gripping the group of writers that contributed to the production polished the script to a high gloss -- the dialogue is snappy without disintegrating into dated parody fodder passionate without becoming melodramatic or sappy and all of this top-notch direction and acting isnt too slick or buffed to loosen the films emotional hold gene tierneys angelic soft-focus beauty is used to great effect she shows herself to be an actress of considerable range and her gentle kind nature is as boundless here as is her psychosis in leave her to heaven the scenes between tierney and andrewss dixon grow more intense and touching the closer he seems to self-destruction near the end of his rope cut bruised and exhausted dixon summarizes his lot: innocent people can get into terrible jams too he says one false move and youre in over your head perhaps what makes this film so totally compelling is the sense that things could go wildly wrong for almost anyone -- especially for someone who is trying so hard to do right -- with one slight shift in the wind one wrong decision or punch or most frighteningly due to factors you have no control over noir has always reflected the darkest fears brought them to the surface where the sidewalk ends does so in a realistic fashion one nit-pick of an aside: this otherwise sterling film has a glaringly poor dub of a blonde model that wouldnt seem out of place on mystery science theater how very odd but noir fans -- heck any movie fans -- who havent seen this one are in for a terrific treat<SEP>1
i have copy of this on vhs i think they the television networks should play this every year for the next twenty years so that we dont forget what was and that we remember not to do the same mistakes again like putting some people in the directors chair where they dont belong this movie rappin is like a vaudevillian musical for those who cant sing or act this movie is as much fun as trying to teach the blind to drive a city busjohn hood peebles has just got out of prison and hes headed back to the old neighborhood in serving time for an all-to-nice crime of necessity of course john heads back onto the old street and is greeted by kids dogs old ladies and his peer homeys as they dance and sing all along the wayi would recommend this if i was sentimental or if in truth someone was smoking medicinal pot prescribed by a doctor for glaucoma either way this is a poorly directed scripted acted and even produced i never thought id sat that satire of ghetto life with the hood although i think the redeeming part of the story through the wannabe gang fight sequences and the dance numbers his friends care about their neighbors and want to save the ghetto from being torn down and cleaned up forget sonny spoon mario could have won an oscar for that in comparison to this rap oh well if you find yourself wanting to laugh yourself silly and three-quarters embarrassed be sure to drink first and please watch responsibly no stars better luck next time!<SEP>0
frank tashlins the home front is one of the more lifeless private snafu shorts a series of cartoons made as instructional films for the military rather than have snafu take some inadvisable actions leading to disaster the home front instead focuses on his loved ones back home and how much they have to offer to the war effort too snafu realises he was wrong when he thought they had it easy its a concept with few possibilities for good gags and instead tashlin plays the risqué card more heavily extended jokes involving strippers and scantily clad dancing girls in place of much effective comic relief the result is a well-meaning short which has little relevance or entertainment value today other than as an historical artefact<SEP>0
i was really hoping that this would be a funny show given all the hype and the clever preview clips and talk about hype i even heard an interview with the shows creator on the bbc world today - a show that is broadcast all over the worldunfortunately this show doesnt even come close to delivering all of the jokes are obvious - the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame - and they are not given any new treatment or twist all of the characters are one-dimensional the acting is - well - mediocre im being nice its the classic cbc recipe - one that always failsif youre muslim i think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters and if youre white youd probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted ignorant or both not that making fun of white people is a problem - most of the better comedies are rooted in that its only a problem when it isnt funny - as in this showcanada is bursting with funny people - so many that we export them to hollywood on a regular basis so how come the producers of this show couldnt find any<SEP>0
i dont know who to blame the timid writers or the clueless director it seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars angie charlie denise rosanna and jon that there wasnt enough left to really make a movie this could have been very entertaining but there was a veil of timidity even cowardice that hung over each scene since it got an r rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a 70-year-old woman and not angie harmon why does sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships with two of the most beautiful and sexy actresses in the world if they were only looking for laughs why not cast whoopi goldberg and judy tenuta instead this was so predictable i was surprised to find that the director wasnt a five year old what a waste not just for the viewers but for the actors as well<SEP>0
this is exactly the reason why many people remain homeless because stupid producers pay their money to make awful films like this instead of donating if they can bother!this film is even worse than white chicks! little man has a lame excuse for posing a character midget as a baby story is awful considering it was written by six people the idea still wouldnt be too bad though if it was original and not a rip-off of a cartoon episode it has funny moments but some of them are way over-done and some are just stupid the acting was very very bad so was the directing anyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves it is racist and very offensive to midgets i mean instead of showing sympathy to them the film-makers make fun of them! it really disgusts me how they do it they see midgets being just like babies and for a character who is a midget pretending to be an abandoned baby just to get a diamond from a certain family that is its lame excuse for showing something like that it just was not worth it dont watch this film it is a huge waste of time and money<SEP>0
the key to the 40-year-old virgin is not merely that andy stitzer is a 40-year-old virgin but rather the manner in which steve carell presents him as one in a genre of crass comedy that has become typified by its lack of humor and engaging characters the 40-year-old virgin offers a colorful cast and an intelligent heartfelt script that doesnt use its protagonist as the butt-end of cruel jokes that andy is still a virgin at forty years old is not as much a joke in fact as it is a curiositycarell a veteran of team ferrell in anchorman and an ex-daily show castmember uses the concept of the film to expand his character  we get to understand why andy is the way he is its the little things that make this film work when andys co-worker at an electronics store asks him what he did for the weekend andy describes his failed efforts at cooking when andy rides his bike to work he signals his turns he doesnt just adorn his home with action figures  he paints them and talks to them and reveals that some of the really old ones have belonged to him since childhood a lesser comedy wouldnt even begin to focus on all of these thingsthe plot is fairly simplistic  andys co-worker pals find out hes never had sex and they make it a personal quest of theirs to get him in bed with a woman its a childish idea and the film makes no attempt to conceal its juvenilityandys friends are a complement to his neurotic nature: david paul rudd has broken up with his girlfriend over two years ago but is still obsessed with her jay romany malco is a womanizing ladies man and cal seth rogen is a tattooed sexaholic their attempts at getting andy in the sack backfire numerous times and each time leaves andy feeling less and less optimisticfinally andy meets single mom trish played by catherine keener and much to the chagrin of his worrying buddies who claim mothers arent worth it he falls in love with her they begin a relationship and agree to put off having sex for twenty days  trish being unaware that andy is still a virginthe 40-year-old virgin was directed by judd apatow the man who produced anchorman and the cable guy and began the short-lived cult tv show freaks and geeks apatow is renowned for his unique sense of humor and the script  co-written by carell  offers plentyhowever in the end the most interesting and indeed surprising aspect of the 40-year-old virgin is its maturity by now you are probably well aware that the film received glowing reviews from the critics and even i was surprised by its warm reception but after seeing the film its easy to understand why we like andy we care about him hes not just some cardboard cutout sex-comedy cliché  hes a real living breathing person his neurotic traits combine the best of woody allen with childish naivety his friends are not unlikable jerks and his romance is tumultuous and bittersweet it strikes a chord with the audiencealthough this is far from being a perfect movie and definitely contains some rather crude innuendo and sexual humor it doesnt offend to the extent that other genre entries might have because we have affection for the people on-screen the best sex comedies work this way  from risky business to american pie  and that is the major difference between something like the 40-year-old virgin and 40 days and 40 nights<SEP>1
### spoilers! ### what is this movie offering out of control editing and cinematography that matches up with a terrible plot it is sad to see denzel washingtons talents go wasted in trashes like thiswe are certainly hinted how the mexicans cannot save themselves outside forces needed possibly militaristic american ones and we know the father is a shady character he is a mexican after all unlike the wife who appreciates creasey more because he is american he killed all of them thinking she died and did she of course she wont she is a young kid and you are not supposed to hurt the sensibilities of the hollywood fan the trade off scene was the only thing that prevents me from rating it below the implausibly successfulas some critic pointed outtaken the nausea of such movies will take time to go it is in the rating of such movies that we have to doubt imdbs credulity77 for a movie like this and 70 for my own private idaho go figure! mine will be in the range of 35-40<SEP>0
i love this movie because i grew up around harness racing pat boone behind the sulky reminds me of my father who was drawn to the trotters because unlike thoroughbred jockeys men of normal height and weight can be drivers yes the 1944 home in indiana is a better movie but its also a very different movie april love is light and easy to watch a feel good movie disappointing though that pat boones religiousmoral views prohibited him from ever kissing the girl! quite a change from todays standard fare home in indiana with walter brennan filmed in black and white with no hint that anyone will ever burst into song captures the stress and struggle better thereby making the ultimate accomplishment more satisfying but it requires a bigger emotional investment<SEP>1
in an otherwise ghastly misbegotten would-be oedipal comedyi was the lone victim at a 7:20 screening tonight 3 days after the movie opened so there is some satisfaction in knowing that moviegoers heeded warningsthe bloom is off jon heders rose the emerging double chin isnt his fault; but rehashing his geeky kid shtick in another bad wig simply isnt working it would be another crime if this were to be eli wallachs last screen appearance diane keaton will probably survive having taken this paycheck - basically because so few will have seen her in this the very worst vehicle shes chosen in the last few weekssitting alone in the theater tonight i came alive laughed even whenever daniels was given the latitude in which to deliver the films sole three dimensional character he really is among our very best actorsin summary even jeff danielss work cant redeem this picture<SEP>0
wow! pretty terrible stuff the richard burtonelizabeth taylor roadshow lands in sardinia and hooks up with arty director joseph losey for this remarkably ill-conceived tennessee williams fiasco taylor plays a rich dying widow holding fort over her minions on an island where she dictates very loudly her memoirs to an incredibly patient secretary when scoundrel burton shows up claiming to be a poet and old friend taylor realizes her time is up ludicrious in the extreme --- its difficult to determine if taylor and burton are acting badly or if it was williams intention to make their characters so unappealing if thats the case then the acting is brilliant! burton mumbles his lines including the word boom several times while taylor screeches hers shes really awful so is noel coward as taylors catty confidante the witch of capri presumably boom is about how fleeting time is and how fast life moves along --- two standard williams themes but its so misdirected by losey that had taylor and burton not spelled it out for the audience during their mostly inane monologues any substance the film has would have been completely diluted boom does have stunning photography---the camera would have to have been out of focus to screw up the beauty of sardinia! the supporting cast features joanna shimkus the great romolo valli as taylors resourceful doctor and michael dunn as her nasty dwarf security guardboth he and his dogs do a number on burton!<SEP>0
the scenes are fast-paced the characters are great i love anne-marie johnsons acting i really like the ending however i was disappointed that this movie didnt delve deeper into achilless and athenas relationship it only blossomed when they kissed each other<SEP>1
the movie starts with a pair of campers a man and a woman presumably together hiking alone in the vast wilderness sure enough the man hears something and it pangs him so much he goes to investigate it our killer greets him with a stab to the stomach he then chases the girl and slashes her throat the camera during the opening scene is from the point of view as the killerwe next meet our four main characters two couples one in which is on the rocks the men joke about how the woman would never be able to handle camping alone at a double date sparking the token blondes ambition to leave a week early unexpectedly the men leave the same day and their car breaks down they end up arriving in the evening when the men arrive they are warned about people disappearing in the forest by a crazy ralph doppleganger they ignore the warning and venture into the blackening night and an eighties song plays in the background with lyrics about being murdered in the dark forest the men get lostin the next scene we realize that this isnt just another the burning clone but a ghost story! the women scared and lonely are huddling together by the fire two children appear in the shadows and decide to play peeping tom well they are obviously ghosts by the way their voices echo! their mother appears with blood dripping from a hole in her forehead and asks the two ladies if theyve seen her children before disappearing of course the children run home to papa and tell him about the two beautiful ladies by the river this causes quite a stir and he gets up grabbing his knife from atop the fireplace daddys going hunting the little girl exclaims with bad acting it is apparent here that the dad isnt a ghost like his childrenfreaked out by something in the woods the token blonde splits running blindly into the night carrying a knife she encounters the father who explains hes starving and it will be quick this doesnt make sense because of the panther growls we heard earlier maybe hes allergic! are panthers honestly even in california she ends up wounding him slightly before getting stabbed in the head a thunderstorm erupts and the men seek shelter which turns out to be where papa resides clearly someone lives here because theres a fire and something weird is roasting over it the children appear and warn them of papa who shows up moments later they disappear as soon as he arrivesfor whatever reason our killer only goes after females he invites the men to have something to eat and tells us the story about his ex wife we are given a flashback of his wife getting caught cheating the old man doesnt tell them however that he kills her and her lover afterwards but daydreams about it we arent given the reason for the childrens demise the men go to sleep and are left unharmed the next morning the men discover the empty campground of their wives after a brief discussion they split up one is to stay at the campsite while the other goes and gets help the one that is going back to his car breaks his leg we are then reunited with the children as they explain to the surviving woman that they are ghosts who killed themselves from being sad about their mother they agree to help the woman reunite with her friendsthe following scene defies the logic of the movie when papa kills the guy waiting at the campsite he was also dating or married to the blonde somehow the children realize he is murdered and tell the woman about it she decides to see it for herself and obviously runs into the killer luckily the children make him stop by threatening to leave him forever you know where this is goingoverall the movie deserves four stars out of ten and thats being generous for all its misgivings the musical score is well done its still watchable too there are some camera angles that look professional and some of the sets are done well the plot is unbelievable there is such a thing as willing suspension of disbelief but with the toad 6 miles away; i cant imagine the token blonde would take off like that in the middle of the night i mean come on!- alan skip bannacheck<SEP>0
somebody owes ang lee an apology actually a lot of people do and ill start i was never interested in the ang lee film hulk because of the near unanimous bad reviews even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it i finally decided to watch it yesterday on usa network and wowspoilers for ang lees hulk and the incredible hulk was it boring! i almost didnt make it through ang lees hulk eric bana was expressionless nick nolte was horrible sam elliott was unlikeable and thats no fun hes usually a cool character in fact i honestly think they chose eric bana because his non-descript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics - and it was clear that the ang lee hulk was meant to facially resemble bruce banner in his non-angry state when hulk fought a mutant poodle i was ready to concede hulk as the worst superhero movie everbut then something happened about 34 of the way through this tedious movie there was a genuinely exciting and - dare i say it - reasonably convincing - extended action scene that starts with hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base fighting m1 tanks and comanche helicopters in the desert then riding an f22 raptor into the stratosphere only to be captured on the streets of san francisco this was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie and i have to say the cgi was quite good thats not to say that the hulk was totally convincing but it didnt require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of non-superhero action movies and thats quite a featof course the ending got really stupid with bruce banners father turning into some sort of shape-shifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of iron mans brief heroics to shame and overall apart from the animated mutant dogs it really did seem like the cgi in hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment it was certainly better than i expectedok but what about the incredible hulk guess what its boring too! it has just a few appearances by the hulk and heres the thing - the cgi in this movie is horrible maybe the hulk in ang lees version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others - but it had its convincing moments also the incredible hulk looked positively ridiculous it had skin tone and muscle tone that didnt even look like a living creature just some sort of computer-generated texture it was really preposterous the lighting environment and facial effects didnt look 5 years newer than ang lees they looked 10 years older and there really is no excuse for that we truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director actor or cinematographer ever couldworse the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from ang lees failure all the same mistakes are made bruce banner is practically emotionless the general is so relentlessly implausibly one-dimensional that he seems faker than the hulk the love interest is unconvincing i have to give liv tyler credit for being more emotional than jennifer connelly though both are quite easy on the eyes tim blake nelson overacts almost as much as nick nolte even though hes only in the movie for a few minutes the hulk really doesnt do much in this movie certainly not any more than in ang lees version the incredible hulk was slightly more fast-paced but since nothing really happened anyway thats not worth much oh yeah the villain is every bit as phony looking as the hulk hes actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster this is how i can definitively say ang lees version was better: if i ever have the chance to see ang lees version again i might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more more likely id just fast forward to the good parts but there is absolutely not a single scene in the incredible hulk that is worth seeing once let alone twice it is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies the cartoonish cgi is an insult to the audience - at least in ang lees version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic except for the giant poodle of courseit is absolutely mind-boggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with ang lees hulk by making almost exactly the same movie it is to edward nortons credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film<SEP>0
i have to say the first i watched this film was about 6 years ago and i actually enjoyed it then i bought the dvd recently and upon a second viewing i wondered why i liked it the acting was awful and as usual we have the stereo-typical clansmen in their fake costumes the acting was awful at best tim roth did an ok job as did liam neeson but ive no idea what jessica lange was thinkingthe plot line was good but the execution was just poor im tired of seeing scotland portrayed like this in the films braveheart was even worse though which is this films only saving grace but seriously people didnt speak like that in those days why do all the actors have to have glaswegian accents just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes i notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the americans and to be honest i can see why theyd like it i know they have an infatuation for men in kilts however if you are thinking of buying the dvd id say spend your money on something else like a better film<SEP>0
yeah its a chick flick and it moves kinda slow but its actually pretty good - and i consider myself a manly man you gotta love judy davis no matter what shes in and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural convincing performancethe scenery of the small coastal summer spot is beautiful and plays well with the major theme of the movie the unknown at least unknown to me actors and actresses lend a realism to the movie that draws you in and keeps your attention overall i give it an 810 go see it<SEP>1
it is always satisfying when a detective wraps up a case and the criminal is brought to book in this case the climax gives me even greater pleasure to see the smug grin wiped off the face of abigail mitchell when she realises her victim has left deathbed testimony which leaves no doubt about her guilt is very satisfyingplease understand: while i admire ruth gordons performance her character really *really* irritates me she is selfish and demanding she gets her own way by putting on a simpering little girl act which is embarrassing in a woman of her age worse she has now set herself up as judge jury and executioner against her dead nieces husbandwhen columbo is getting too close she tries to unnerve him by manipulating him into making an off-the-cuff speech to an audience of high-class ladies he turns the tables perfectly by delivering a very warm and humane speech about the realities of police worknothing can distract columbo from the pursuit of justice abbys final appeal to his good nature is rejected because he has too much self-respect not to do his job well here is one situation you cant squirm out of ms mitchell!<SEP>1
despite an overall pleasing plot and expensive production one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes where were the japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants not on the payroll apparently a japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities she watched unfold before her eyes in a later conversation she said imagine a finnish director making a movie in fnnish about the american civil war using blond swedish actors as union army and frenchmen as the confederates worse imagine dressing the scarlet ohara female lead in a period hoop skirt missing the hoop and sporting a 1950s hairdo maybe some people in finland might not realize that the hoop skirt was missing the hoop or recognize the bizarre jane mansfield hair but in atlanta they would not believe their eyes or earsand be laughing in the aislesexcellent story and photography be damnedsowatching memoirs of a geisha was painful for anyone familiar with japanese cultural nuances actual geisha or japanese dress and that was the topic of the movie! hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making they frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films refinement embarrassingly wrong i thought the last samurai was the crowning achievement of how bad an otherwise good film on japan could be memoirs of a geisha is embarrassingly better and worse at the same time<SEP>0

not a movie but a lip synched collection of performances from acts that were part of the british invasion that followed the dynamic entrance of the beatles to the music world some of these acts did not make a big splash on this side of the pond but a lot of them did featured are: hermans hermits billy j kramer and the dakotas peter and gordon honeycombs nashville teens animals and of coursethe beatlesit is so much fun watching these young acts before they honed and polished their acts<SEP>0
my choice for greatest movie ever used to be laughtons night of the hunter which remains superb in my canon but it may have been supplanted by shower which is the most artistically daoist movie i have seen the way that caring for others is represented by the flowing of water and the way that water can be made inspiration and comfort and cleansing and etc is the essence of the dao it is possible to argue that the the nofth and shower themes are similar and that lillian gish in the former represents the purest form of christianity as the operators of the bathhouse represent the purest form of daoism i would not in any way argue against such an interpretation both movies are visual joys in their integration of idea and image yet shower presents such an unstylized view of the sacredness of everyday life that i give it the nod i revere both<SEP>1
let me begin by saying i am a big fantasy fan however this film is not for me many far-fetched arguments are trying to support this films claim that dragons possibly ever existed the film mentions connections in different stories from different countries but fails to investigate them more thoroughly which could have given the film some credibility the film uses nice! cgi to tell us a narrated fantasy story on a young dragons life this is combined with popular-tv-show-csi-style flash-forwards to make it look like something scientific which it is definitely not in many cases the argumentsclues are far-fetched in some cases clues used to show dragons possibly existed or flew or spit fire are simply invalid to see this just makes me get cramp in my toes even a fantasy film needs some degree of reality in it but this one just doesnt have it bottom line: its a pretentious fantasy-csi documentary not worth watching<SEP>0

this is an above average jackie chan flick due to the fantastic finale and great humor however other then that its nothing special all the characters are pretty cool and the film is entertaining throughout plus jackie chan is simply amazing in this! jackie and wai-man chan had fantastic chemistry together and are both very funny! and i thought the main opponent looked really menacing! however the dubbing was simply terrible! the character development is above average for this sort of thing! and the main fight is simply fantastic! plus some of the bumps jackie takes in this one are harsh! there is a lot of really silly and goofy humor in this but it amused me and the ending is hilarious! plus all the characters are quite likable its pretty cheap looking but generally very well made and while it does not have the amount of fighting you would expect from a jackie chan flick it does enough to keep you watching plus one of my favorite moments in this film is when jackie dragon and wai-man chantiger are playing around with a rifle and it goes off! this is an above average jackie chan flick due to the fantastic finale and great humor however other then that its nothing great still its well worth the watch! the direction is good jackie chan does a good job here with solid camera work fantastic angles and keeping the film at a fast pace for the most part the acting is very good! jackie chan is amazing as always and is amazing here he is extremely likable hilarious as usual does some crazy stunts had fantastic chemistry with wai-man chan kicked that ass and played this wonderful cocky character he was amazing! i just wished they would stop dubbing him! jackie rules!!!!! wai-man chan is funny as jackies best friend i really liked him he is also a very good martial artist rest of the cast do ok i guess overall well worth the watch! *** out of 5<SEP>1

i absolutely loved this movie! it was so good! this movie is told by the parrot paulies point of view paulie is given to the little girl marie as a present paulie helps marie learn to talk and they become best friends but when paulie tells marie to fly she falls and the bird is sent away thats when the adventure begins paulie goes through so much to find his way back to marie this movie is so sweet funny touching sad and more when i first watched this movie it made me cry the birds courage and urge to go find his marie for all that time was so touching i must say that the ending is so sweet and sad but youll have to watch it to find out how it goes at the end the janitor tries to help him after hearing his story will he find his long lost marie or not find out when you watch this sweet heart warming movie itll touch your heart rating:10<SEP>1
i really wanted to like this movie but it never gave me a chance its basically meant to be spinal tap with a hip hop theme but it fails miserably it consistently feels like it was written and acted by high-school kids for some school project and thats also the level the humor seems to be aimed at there is no subtlety and more damningly for a mockumentary it never once feels like a documentary and while the lines arent funny in the first place an attempt at dead-pan delivery would have helped -- certainly anything would be better than the shrill overacting we are subjected toid recommend this to people who like comedies in the vein of big mommas house or norbit; people who think that words like butt are inherently hysterically funny other people should stay away and not waste their time<SEP>0
flight of fury starts as general tom barnes angus macinnes organises an unofficial test flight of the x-77 a new stealth fighter jet with the ability to literally turn invisible general barnes gives his top pilot colonel ratcher steve toussaint the job & everything goes well until the x-77 disappears even more literally than barnes wanted as ratcher flies it to northern afghanistan & delivers it to a terrorist group known as the black sunday lead by peter stone vincenzo nicoli who plans to use the x-77 to fly into us airspace undetected & drop some bombs which will kills lots of people general barnes is worried by the loss of his plane & sends in one man army john sands co-writer & executive producer steven seagal to get it back & kill all the bad guys in the processthis american british & romanian co-production was directed by michael keusch & was the third film in which he directed seagal after the equally awful shadow man 2006 & attack force 2007 luckily someone decided the partnership wasnt working & an unsuspecting public have thankfully been spared any further collaborations between the two apparently flight of fury is an almost scene-for-scene word-for-word remake of black thunder 1988 starring michael dudikoff with many of the same characters even sharing the same name so exactly the same dialogue could be used without the makers even having to change things like names although i must admit i have never seen black thunder & therefore cannot compare the two flight of fury is a terrible film the poorly made & written waste of time that seagal specialises in these days its boring even though its not that slow the characters are poor its full of clichés things happen at random the plot is poor the reasoning behind events are none existent & its a very lazy production overall as it never once convinces the viewer that they are anywhere near afghanistan or that proper military procedures are being followed the action scenes are lame & theres no real excitement in it the villains are boring as are the heroes & its right down there with the worst seagal has madeflight of fury seems to be made up largely of stock footage which isnt even matched up that well the background can change peoples clothes change the area changes the sky & the quality of film changes very abruptly as its all too obvious we are watching clips from other better films spliced in hell seagal never even goes anywhere near a plane in this the action scenes consist of shoot-outs so badly edited its hard to tell who is who & of course seagal breaking peoples arms the whole production feels very cheap & shoddythe imdb reckons this had a budget of about $12000000 which i think is total rubbish i mean if so where did all the money go although set in afghanistan which is a war torn arid desert flight of fury looks like it was filmed down my local woods it was actually shot in romania & the romanian countryside does not make a convincing afghanistan the acting is terrible as one would expect & seagal looks dubbed againflight of fury is a terrible action film that is boring amateurish & is an almost scene-for-scene remake of another film anyway another really lazy & poorly produced action thriller from seagal why do i even bother any more<SEP>0
this film was a major letdown the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and mean-spirited the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with the lead protagonists character was as slimy as they come the sickroomhothouse atmosphere lent itself to over-the-top theatrics little or nothing could be learned about the spanish civil war from this film fortunately ive been to spain and realize this is not realistic! in addition the use of same-sex attraction as a lurid horror was also very offensive and poorly handled while the dvd is being packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers the actors seemed uncomfortable in their rolesas if they were trying to distance themselves from this messi guess if you like watching children and pets being brutally killedthis film might especially appeal to you<SEP>0
now this is one of bigs best jack hulberts single role in 1931 split into two for the band waggon radio team askey & murdoch it boasts a great stalwart cast who ham the play up for all theyre worth especially askey of course histrionics were provided by linden travers melodramatics by herbert lomas and pragmatics by richard murdochthe group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they bargained for ghostly trains spectral porters hairy sausage rolls and arthur trying to entertain them all his repartee with everyone falls between side-splitting and ghastly dull when the formula works its very good but it sometimes gets very contrived and forced making the film seem more dated than it is but those damn treacherous fifth columnists - thank any god britain hasnt got any nowadays!ultimately a nice harmless film to welcome back to the tv screen as an old friend but if you were expecting to be shivered out of your timbers youll probably be very disappointed!<SEP>1
either or i love the suspension of any formulaic plot in this movie i have re-visited it many times and it always holds up a little too stylized for some but i fancy that any opera lover will love it norman jewison a fellow canadian takes enormous chances with his movies and his casting and it nearly always pays off in movies that are off centre and somehow delicious as this one is i have often wondered at the paucity of chers acting roles whether she has chosen to minimize this part of her life or she does not get enough good roles to chew on i have found her to be a superb actress who can retreat into a role as in this particular one or be loud and daring and fierce as in mask i found the comedic strokes broad at times a hair salon called cinderellabut this was the whole intent of both the writer and director nicolas page plays the angst ridden tenor of opera all extravagant gestures at one point demanding a knife so as to slit his own throat the brooklyn scenes are magical this is a brooklyn under moonlight romanticized and dramatic just like opera all in all a very satisfying film not to everyones taste by a long shot i loved the ending everyone brought together like a greek chorus every part subtly nuanced and blending with the others the camera pulling away down the hall leaving the players talking 8 out of 10<SEP>1

to heighten the drama of this sudsy maternity ward story its set in a special ward for difficult cases the main story is loretta youngs; shes on leave from a long prison stretch for murder will the doctors save her baby at the cost of her life or heed her husbands plea for the opposite melodrama and sentiment are dominant and theyre not the honest sort to say the least for example just to keep things moving this hospital has a psycho ward next door to the maternity ward and lets a woman with a hysterical pregnancy wander about stealing babiesthere are just enough laughs and sarcasm for this to be recognizable as a warners film mostly from glenda farrell who swigs gin from her hot-water bottle while she waits to have twins that to her chagrin she finds theres now a law against selling an example of her repartee: be careful farrell: its too late to be careful aline macmahon is of course wonderfully authoritative as the chief nurse but dont expect her to be given a dramatic momentthe main theme of the film is that the sight of a baby turns anyone to mush even given the obvious limitations this film should have been better than it is<SEP>0
because cruel would be the only word in existence to describe the intentions of these film makers where do you even begin in a spout of b*tchiness im going to start with the awful acting of nearly everybody in this movie scratch that nearly does not belong in that sentence i cant think of even one character who was portrayed well although in all fairness it would be nearly impossible to portray these zero dimensional characters in a successful way still the girl who played katherine whose name i purposefully dont include - im pretending she doesnt exist remains one of the worst actors ive ever seen only eclipsed by the guy who played sebastian the story was god awful it attempted to mirror the brilliance that was the first one but failed in so many ways pretty much every part of it was pointless - though i will admit grudgingly that the plot twist was quite good it its surprise and the ending was at least slightly humorous but this film is up there with the worst ive seen dont watch it just dont there is absolutely no value in watching it none it only takes away the enjoyment of the first<SEP>0
we know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes: an idée reçue few would challenge friends and family of these and others who perished in the attacks on the world trade center might well be moved by this vapid play turned film a sweet earnest though tongue-tied fireman recalls what he can of lost colleagues to a benumbed journalist who converts his fragments into a eulogy they ponder the results he mumbles some more she composes another eulogy etc etcthe dreadful events that provoked the need for several thousand eulogies is overwhelmingly sad but this plodding insipid dramatization is distressingly boring<SEP>0
i completely agree with the other comment someone should do a whats up tiger lily with this filmit has to be one of the worst french films ive seen in a long time actually along with brotherwood of the wolves 2 horrendous films in a much too short period of timeits really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea kind of fun antoine decaunes in particular and jean rochefort being among my darlings i was bitterly disappointed to see them compromised in such a poor filmlou doyon is quite bad as usual which goes to prove that a pretty face and famous parents can get you into the movies but they dont necessarily give you talentavoid this film if you want to laugh watch an alain chabat instead or some nice period piece full of fun like la fille de dartagnan<SEP>0
when a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible the cause can invariably be found in the book: either it was pointless to start with or the point is one not easily conveyed to film or the movie missed the point which is the most frequent of these results and the easiest to happen especially when the point is one not easily defined the book morvern callar has a point; every reader of the book must have felt this and felt as if he had gotten it; but i suspect most of them could not state it in words im not sure i can myself but perhaps it comes to this or something like it: things come things go such is life but we carry on; or at any rate some of us--people like morvern--do no doubt a more erudite critic could construct a more adequate definition but the important fact is that there is a point--possibly the sum of the entire story is the point--and that this would have been the main thing to keep in view and to carry over in adapting the story to film the maker of this film evidently missed the point and doesnt substitute one of her own; and so the film is about nothingthis is not the usual complaint of a book-lover that his favorite text has been violated the merit of the book is something i conceded grudgingly: in reading it i found it a bloody nuisance and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly the narrative is supposed to be the work of the half-educated morvern but that illusion is constantly dispelled by a dozen different types of literary effect as if the author were poking at her with his pen; there are inconsistencies of style and tone as if different sections had been composed at different times; and any conclusions i could reach about morvern had to remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended and which he did not: for instance despite morverns own self-characterization as a raver am i wrong that in the end she remains essentially a working-class scots girl and beneath her wrapping of music downloads not so different from those of generations past in any case despite my irritation at the author i couldnt deny that his book stuck with me; and what i couldnt get out of my head was his characters attitude her angle on the world which was almost as vivid as a goya portrait morvern is the kind of person whos always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible; occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her like flies so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful slogging-through unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophical--and that doesnt begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough the complex of incidents and of morverns responses to them are the substance of the book and its achievement in exposing a cross-section of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise; for all my dislike of the book i can see thisthe morvern just described is not the morvern of the movie; or if it is most of her is kept offscreen an actress who might have been a good fit for the character had she been the right age at the right time is angharad rees from the old tv series poldark samantha morton then would seem like good casting: shes rather the same sort of actress and in one of her earlier movies jesus son she played a girl who with a few adjustments could have been turned into this one unfortunately as the film turned out she doesnt have the character from the book to play for one thing the book is one that if it is to be dramatized virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience; without her comments her perspective her voice the story loses most of its meaning it has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements: the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty and so morverns responses whether of amusement or distaste depending on her mood are missing too and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story in short the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk edgy serio-comic novel into a genteel art tv film and chose as her typical image one of ms morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy; as if the outing morvern signs up for were a tour of the stations of the cross this isnt at all what the book or the morvern of the book was about for another thing the morvern of the movie isnt scottish the actress said in an interview she hadnt had time to study up the accent and she ought to be: its important that she her family and her mates are all from a single place and finally the film is missing the end of the story: morverns spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness: its winter the dam has frozen the power has gone out and the pub is dark minus this and minus all of the rest whats left is a failed art film a dead film about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her refusal or native inability ever to give in to being dead<SEP>0

i see a lot of people liked this movie to me this was a movie made right of writing 101 and the person failed the class from the time lindsey price the videographer shows up until the end the movie was very predictable i kept on watching to see if it was going anywherefirst we have the widowed young father cliché #1 moviestv always kill off the the mother parent if the child is a girl or a brood of boys so the single father can get swoon over his dead wife and seem completely out of his element taking care of the children starting from from my 3 sons to 2 12 dads these movies are usually dramas and comedies are tv showscliché # 2 when a pushy woman has a video camera in her hand she will play a big part in the movie and will always have solutions or even if that person is a airhead cliché #3 if the person in peril is a foreigner they have to be of latino origin and they must be illegal apparently there are no legal latinos and illegal europeans unless if there is a ira element involvedcliché #4 the said latino must be highly educated in his native country in this case he was a profesor who made 200 per month and the said highly educated latino must now act like he hasnt brain in his head now and lets the air head side kick take overcliché #5 the crime the person committed really wasnt a crime but a accident but because in this case he has lost all of the sense he had when he crossed the boarder he now acts like a blithering idiot and now has put his own daughter in peril by taking her along on a fruitless quest to the border with the idiot side kickcliché #6 one never runs over a hoodlum running from a crime but some poor little cute kid this is because the parents of the child have to play a big part of the movie and because the the person who accidentally killed the child can have ridiculous interaction with the parentscliché #7 name me one movie in which one cop is not the angry vet and they get paired up with a rookie even if they are homicide detectives who have to be the most experienced cops on a police force sev7n and copy cat and law and order come to mind right away and the vet even though gruff on the outside has a heart of goldcliché #8 lets go and round up some unemployed soap stars now i like lindsey price but susan haskell imo can not act her way out of a paper bag and when she use to be on one life to live as marty he swayed from right to left every time she opened her mouth it use to get me sea sick she might be anchored on land better now but she still cannot actthe movie might have been more insightful if it wasnt filled with clichés i dont think a movie has to be expensive or cerebral to be good but this was just bad***spoiler**** now i am not going to spoil the ending oh heck i will because i feel it will be a disservice to humanity to let a person waste time they will never get back looking at this movie it involves cliché #6 and #7 unless a person has never seen a movie before you had to see what was coming the father makes even a dumber mistake runs from the cops at the end and gets shot by the angry veteran who all of a sudden is very upset you would think she thought the poor guy was innocent all through the movie and she shot him by mistake when she didnt now for the little girl who the dad brought along with him guess what happen to her times up she ends up living with the family whose child was killed by her father!! come on! you all knew that was going to happen because she is a replacement child!! that is why she did not go and live with the lindey price character this movie was a insult as far as i was concerned because there were so many avenues this movie could of explored and went down but it chose to take the cliché ridden one the 2 stars are for 2 of the stars the little girl who i thought was very good and lindsey price who character was annoying but she did what she could with it my advice is take a vice and squeeze your head with it instead of looking at this dreck<SEP>0

i remember watching this film a while ago and after seeing 3000 miles to graceland it all came flooding back why this hasnt had a video or dvd release yet its sacrilegious that this majesty of movie making has never been released while other rubbish has been in fact this is the one john carpenter film that hasnt been released in fact i havent seen it on the tv either since the day i watched it kurt russell was the perfect choice for the role of elvis this is definitely a role he was born to play john carpenters break from horror brought this gem that id love the tv to play again it is well acted and well performed as far as the singing goes belting out most of elviss greatest hits with gusto i think this also was the film that formed the partnership with russell and carpenter which made them go on to make a number of great movies escape from new york the thing big trouble in little china and escape from la someone has got to release this before someone does a remake or their own version of his life which i feel would not only tarnish the king but also ruin the magic that this one has if this doesnt get released then we are gonna be in heartbreak hotel<SEP>1
this is a rip-roaring british comedy movie and one that i could watch over and over again without growing tired peter ustinov has never performed in a bad role and this is no exception particularly with his dry wit but very clever master plan karl malden has always been an admirer of mine since he starred in streets of san francisco i believe that maggie smith is the real star of this film though appearing to be so inept at everything she tries to do but in truth is so switched on particularly at the end when she informs everyone that she has invested so much money that she has discovered whilst laundering his clothes one thing does concern me though could someone please tell me why i cannot purchase this on either dvd or vhs format in the uk could someone please assist<SEP>1

you know the people in the movie are in for it when king-sized hailstones fall from a clear blue sky in fact the weather stays pretty bad throughout this atmospheric thriller and only lawyer chamberlain has the answer but hes too much the european rationalist i gather to get in touch with that inner being that only reveals itself through dreamsdarkly original mystery heavy on the metaphysics from director-writer peter weir already he had proved his skill at flirting with other dimensions in picnic at hanging rock 1975 here its the arcane world of the australian aborigines that confronts that the tightly ordered world of the predominant whites something strange is going on inside the aborigine community when they kill one of their number for no apparent reason yuppie lawyer chamberlain is supposed to defend them in a white mans court but the more he looks into things the more mysterious things get and the more interested a strange old aboriginal man gets in him and then therere those scary dreams that come and go at odd timeswell structured screenplay deepens interest throughout one reason the movie works is the background normalcy of chamberlains wife and little daughters audiences can readily identify with them and when their little world runs into forces beyond the usual framework the normalcy begins to buckle and we get the feeling of worlds beginning to collide chamberlain underplays throughout especially during the underground discovery tour where i think he should have shown more growing awareness than he does after all its the picking up of the mask that holds the key i believe to the riddle yet his reaction doesnt really register the revelation of course the notion of nature striking back has a certain resonance now thirty years later in the film the notion is wrapped in a lot of entertaining hocus-pocus but the subject itself remains a telling one one way of bringing out a central irony in the movie is the symbolism of the opening scene a big white suv barrels past an aboriginal family leaving them in the historical dust the terrain looks like an interior tribal reservation of no particular importance to the coastal fleshpots where industry dwells yet its also a region most likely to survive anything like a destructive last wave perhaps theres something about past and future to think about hereanyway this is a really good movie that will probably stay with you<SEP>1
if it were possible to distill the heart and soul of the sport--no the pure lifestyle--of surfing to its perfect form this documentary has done it this documentary shows the life isnt just about the waves but its more about the people the pioneers and the modern day vanguard that are pushing the envelope of big wave further than its ever beenstacy peralta--a virtual legend from my early 80s skateboarding days as a socal teen--has edited reams of amazing stock and interview footage down to their essence and created what is not just a documentary but a masterpiece of the genre when his heart and soul is in the subject matter--and clearly it is here--his genius is fraught with a pure vision that doesnt glamorize hype or sentimentalize his subject he reveres surfers and the surfingbeach lifestyle but doesnt whitewash it either there is a gritty reality to the sport as wellthere is so much that could be said about this documentary about the surfers the early history of the sport and the wild big wave surfers it profiles greg noll the first big wave personality who arguably pioneered the sport; jeff carter an amazing guy who rode virtually alone for 15 years on northern californias extremely dangerous mavericks big surf; and the centerpiece of the documentary laird hamliton big wave surfings present day messiahthere is tremendous heart and warmth among all these guys--and a few girls who show up on camera--and a deep and powerful love for surfing and the ocean that comes through in every word i found the story of how hamiltons adopted father met him and how hamilton as a small 4- or 5-year old boy practically forced him to be his dad especially heartwarming and again stripped of syrupy sentimentalityif you like surfing--or even if you dont--this is a wonderful documentary that must be watched if only because youre a student of the form or someone who simply appreciates incredibly well-done works of art<SEP>1
first of all this is a low-budget movie so my expectations were incredibly low going into it i assume most people looking at the info for this movie just wanted a bloodfest and essentially thats all it isplot there really is none its basically saw but in china and a whole hell of a lot worse cast there is none period special effects absolutely awful in my opinion there were cutaways and the blood was often completely unbelievable because of amounts splatter color texture etci believe the purpose of this movie was supposed to be a brutal shock film now it had some great potential on a bigger budget but poor scripting poor dialogue awful acting what seemed like camcorder video shots and just plain unbelievable gore made this movie truly awfulthere are movies worth taking a chance against some reviews even b-rate movies deserve some opportunities blood trails for example was the most recent i saw against reviews that was worth it but this was simply awful i hope that people considering this movie read my comment and decide against itim all for brutality and shock but the overall unrealism and truly awful acting makes for an awful experience save your timemoney and chance something else you wont be disappointed<SEP>0

if you havent seen the gong show tv series then you wont like this movie much at all not that knowing the series makes this a great movie i give it a 5 out of 10 because a few things make it kind of amusing that help make up for its obvious problems1 its a funny snapshot of the era it was made in the late 1970s and early 1980s 2 you get a lot of funny cameos of people youve seen on the show 3 its interesting to see chuck the host when he isnt doing his on air tv personality 4 you get to see a lot of bizarre people doing all sorts of weirdness just like you see on the tv showi wont list all the bad things because theres a lot of them but heres a few of the most prominent1 the gong show movie has a lot of the actual tv show clips which gets tired at movie length 2 the movies story line outside of the clip segments is very weak and basically is made up of just one plot point 3 chuck is actually halfway decent as an actor but most of the rest of the actors are doing typical way over the top 1970s flatnessits a good movie to watch when you dont have an hour and a half you want to watch all at once watch 20 minutes at a time and its not so bad but even then its not so good either ;<SEP>0
i did not think this movie was worth anything bad script bad acting except for janine turner no fantasy stupid plot dumb-ass husband and unfair divorce settings if you have never seen this movie before dont even bother its not worth it at all the only thing that was good about it was that janine turner did a good job acting terrys husband is a stuck up smart-ass defense attorney who has won a lot of cases and even gotten guility murderers off he think he is so smart but he is really just a nut her best friend has an affair with her husband and betrays her nice girl huh yeah shes a real peach not shes no day at the beach either<SEP>0
sydney lumet although one of the oldest active directors still got game! a few years ago he shot find me guilty a proof to everyone that vin diesel can actually act if he gets the opportunity and the right director if he had retired after this movie a true masterpiece in my eyes no one could have blamed him but hes still going strong his next movie already announced for 2009but lets stay with this movie right here the cast list is incredible their performance top notch the little nuances in their performances the real dialogue andor situations that evolve throughout the movie are just amazing the time structure of the movie that keeps your toes the whole time blending time-lines so seamlessly that the editing seems naturalflawless the story is heightened by that although even in a normal time structure it wouldve been at least a good movie dramathriller i can only highly recommend it the rest is up to you! :o<SEP>1
the lovely danish actress sonja richter steals this film from under the noses of everyone no small feat considering the terrific performances surrounding herrichter plays anna an out-of-work independent-minded somewhat neurotic and perhaps suicidal actress who lands a desperation job looking after a wheelchair-bound muted aged father named walentin the great danish actor frits helmuth who died at 77 shortly after this film was madespoiler alertwalentin refuses to respond to anyone --until he confronts the gifted anna whose whimsical and mischievous manner brings the poor old battered devil back from a self-imposed death sentencewriterdirectoractor eric clausen has made a strong film about the difficulty a ponderous businessman son jorgen played by clausen has loving a father who has never accepted him the film sags toward the end but clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia the nature and value of loving and caring and how one person the irrepressible anna can alter the course of a human life highly recommended sonja richters performance is alone worth the price of admission<SEP>1
that is the best way i can describe this movie which centers on a newly married couple who move into a house that is haunted by the husbands first wife who died under mysterious circumstances that sounds well and good but what plays out is an hour of pure boredom in fact one of the funny things about this flick is that there is a warning at the beginning of the film that promises anyone who dies of fright a free coffin well trust me no one ever took them up on that offer unless someone out there is terrified of plastic skulls peacocks weird gardeners and doors being knocked on and the music is the worst it consists of constant tuba music which sounds like it is being played by some sixth grader and you will figure out the terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to wonder what the people in this movie were thinking someone dies while running and hitting their head and the police are never called to investigate yes in the end this is a slow paced which is really bad considering the movie is only just over an hour boring little tale that is easily figured out by the average person apparently none of the characters in this flick were the average person<SEP>0
the two things are are good about this film are its two unknown celebritiesfirst daphne zuniga in her first appearance in a film young and supple with looks that still encompass her body today steals the very beginning which is all she is in and that is that she is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next projectssecond the score by then known composer christopherchris young is what keeps this stinker from getting a one staryeah i know one star more is not much but in this movies case it is a lotthe rest is just stupid senseless horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer blah blah blahwe all know where this is goingwatch the first eighteen minutes with daphne zuniga then turn it off<SEP>0
my baby sitter was a fan so i saw many of the older episodes while growing up im not a fan of scooby doo so im not sure why i left the tv on when this show premiered to my surprise i found it enjoyable to me shaggy and scooby were the only interesting characters *dodges tomatoes from fans of the others* so i like that they only focus on those two however this may cause fans of the original shows to hate it i like the voice acting especially dr phinius phibes i liked listening to him even before i knew he was jeff bennett and jim meskimen as robi sounds to me like hes really enjoying his job as an actor i also get a kick out of the techies with their slightly autistic personalities and their desires to play dungeons and dragons or act out scenes from star wars not called by those names in the show of course<SEP>1
i got to see this just this last friday at the los angeles film festival at laemlees on beverly this movie got the most applause of all the films that evening considering that two music videos opened first i didnt know what to expect since they were very fast and attention grabbing i wasnt sure i was ready for a short immediately but to my surprise i really enjoyed this i thought the main actor demon guy was really good i was so impressed with his performance that i checked out his name i was surprised to see that this was the witchblade guy hes gotten really good especially since then! either that or he was given lousy roles or had been pushed by the director really hard for this short the girl did an okay job i guess its hard since it was her first performance and being so young the dad did well also there was a lot of really nice cg work for a short both for this and the short playing next mexican hat which was also nice but i enjoyed this the most because it had the most depth and emotion and i actually cared about the characters the other was a very simple story the story was quite illustrative and dark! it dealt with real topics using a more fantasy like approach to keep add people like me interested we wont even talk about the last film in the block which i left my only complaint is that i only wish i had seen more of the demon character and a little less of getting started which is why i gave it a 9 out of 10 i also thought the end credits went a little slowly otherwise it was beautifully told directed and edited the timing was very nice with a complete change from the fast mtv editing done on everything nowadays there will be more coming from this director in the future as well as the actor i now will think of him as the sorrows lost actor not the witchblade guy<SEP>1
cheezy action movie starring dolph lungren lungren is a one time military man who has retreated into a teaching job but the changes in the neighborhood and the student body have left him frustrated and he decides that hes going to hang it up things get dicey when while watching over a bunch of students in detention some robbers take over the school as a base of operation for an armored car robbery its dolph versus the baddies in a fight to the death jaw dropping throw back to the exploitation films of the late grindhouse era where bad guys dressed as punks and some of the bad women had day glow hair what a stupid movie watchable in a i cant believe people made this sort of way this is an action film that was probably doomed from the get go before the low budget fake breakaway sets and poor action direction were even a twinkle in a producers eye watch how late in the film as cars drive through the school dont ask they crash into the security turret dont ask since it looks more like a prison then a high school and smash its barely constructed form apartit doesnt look like it did in earlier shots what hath the gods of bad movies wrought actually im perplexed since this was directed by sydney j furie a really good director who made films like the boys in company c has his ability failed him or was this hopeless from the get go and he didnt even bother its a turkey a watchable one but a turkey none the less<SEP>0
an art house mavens dream overrated overpraised overdone; a pretentious melange that not only did not deserve best picture of 1951 on its own merits it was dwarfed by the competition from the start place in the sun detective story streetcar named desire abbott and costello meet the invisible man; you name it if it came out in 51 its better than this arthouse crapola the closing ballet is claptrap for the intellectual crowd out of place and in the wrong movie few actors in their time were less capable at acting or less charismatic than kelly and caron my #12 worst of 51 i saw 201 movies and among the 5 worst best picture oscar winners<SEP>0
i saw this movie only after hearing raves about it for years needless to say the actual experience proved a bit anticlimactic but still alec guiness energetically leads a wonderful cast in a jolly if formulaic romp through industrial post-wwii englandthis is the familiar tale of the woes of inventing the perfect everyday product remember the car that runs on water remember the promise of nuclear energy in this case its a fabric that doesnt wear out wrinkle or even get dirty! of course fabric manufacturers and their workers are horrified at the prospect of being put out of business and so the plot gets a bit thickguiness makes the whole enterprise worthwhile and watching him blow up a factory research lab over and over again is quite a blast! those brits always the stiff upper lip when under fire the film might chug along exactly like guinesss goofy invention but its a good ride all the same<SEP>1
the best of times is one of the great sleepers of all time the setup does not tax your patience the development is steady the many intertwined relationships are lovingly established the gags and bits all work and all are funny there is lots of sentimentality kurt russell playing reno hightower puts in one of his best performances and robin williams playing jack dundee is sure-footed as ever the cast also includes many great supporters jacks wife is played by jack palances daughter who is lovely as is renos wife who is a great comedian i cant tell you how many times ive watched this movie how many times i have enjoyed it and how often i wish that more people could see it<SEP>1
i tried i really did i thought that maybe if i gave joao pedro rodrigues another chance i could enjoy his movie i know that after seeing o fantasma i felt ill and nearly disgusted to the core but some of the reviews were quite good and in favor so i was like what the hell at least you didnt pay 10 dollars at the quad give it a shotsometimes its better to go to your dentist and ask for a root canal without any previous anesthetic to alleviate the horror of so much pain i often wonder if it wouldnt be better to go back to my childhood and demand my former bullies to really let me have it on other occasions i often think that the world is really flat and that if i sail away far enough i will not only get away from it all but fall clear over and that some evil lovecraftian thing will snatch me with its 9000 tentacles and squeeze the life -- and some french fries from 1995 still lingering inside my esophagus -- out of meis there a reason for odete id say not at all just that maybe her creator thought that writing a story centered on her madness one that makes alex forrest look like strawberry shortcake look not only creepy but flat-out sick to the bone she first of all decides to leave her present boyfriend in shrieking hysterics because she wants a child and he believes theyre too young she later crashes a funeral of a gay man and -- get this -- in order to get closer to him she feigns being pregnant while insinuating herself into the lives of the dead mans mother and lover in the sickest of ways oh of course she shrieks like a banshee and throws herself not one but a good three times on his grave and theres this ridiculous business that she progressively becomes pedro which sums up some weak-as-bad-tea explanation that love knows no gender or somethingid say shes as nuts as a can of cashews unsalted but then again sos the director and me for taking a chance on this at least the men look good other than that not much else to see here<SEP>0
carols journey is a pleasure to watch for so many reasons the acting of clara lago is simply amazing for someone so young and she is one of those special actors who can say say much with facial expressions director imanol urbibe presents a tight and controlled film with no break in continuity thereby propelling the plot at a steady pace with just enough suspense to keep one wondering what the nest scene will bring the screenplay of angel garcia roldan is story telling at its best which it seems if the major purpose for films after all the plot is unpredictable yet the events as they unravel are completely logical perhaps the best feature of this film if to tell a story of the spanish civil war as it affected the people it was a major event of the 20th century yet hardly any americans know of it in fact in 40 years of university teaching i averaged about one student a semester who had even heard of it much less any who could say anything comprehensive about it--and the overwhelming number of students were merit scholars all of which speaks to the enormous amount of censorship in american education so in one way this film is a good way to begin a study of that event keeping in mind that when one thread is pulled a great deal of history is unraveled the appreciation of this film is therefore in direct relation to the amount of ones knowledge to view this film as another coming of age movie is the miss the movie completely the left elbow index considers seven aspects of film-- acting production sets character development plot dialogue film continuity and artistry--on a scale for 10 for very good 5 for average and 1 for needs help carols journey is above average on all counts excepting dialogue which is rated as average the lei average for this film is 93 raised to a 10 when equated to the imdb scale i highly recommend this film for all ages<SEP>1
i saw this film earlier today and i was amazed at how accurate the dialog is for the main characters it didnt feel like a film - it felt more like a documentary the part i liked best the leading ladies in this film seemed as real to me as any fifteen year-old girls i knowall in all a very enjoyable film for those who enjoy independent films<SEP>1
they had such potential for this movie and they completely fall flat in the first cruel intentions we are left wondering what motivated the lead characters to become the way they are and act the way they do there is almost no character development whatsoever in this prequel its actually a very sad story but this film did nothing for me it was as if they left out good writing in place of unneeded f-words and the end makes absolutely no sense and doesnt explain anything the writing was just terrible another thing that bothered me was that they used at lease 3 of the exact same lines that were in the original such as down boy or the kissing scene and a few others i cant remember i was not impressed at all by robins acting but amy did a great job thats about the only thing that reconciled this movie<SEP>0
like most people i was intrigued when i heard the concept of this film especially the film makers were then attacked aspect that the case seems to emphasize what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mobthen to watch the film and discover oh what they mean by the film makers were attacked was some kids threw rocks at a sign and a number of people complained loudly and said someone should beat those two kids up the picture on the cover the chase as it were total fabrication which i guess ties in with the theme of the film lying and manipulation to satisfy vain stupid children with more money and time then sensei have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this film its like michael moores roger & me but if roger & me was moore mocking the people of flint its completely misdirected and totally inane wow! can you believe that people who suffered under the yoke of communism would be really excited to have markets full of food what jerks! and its not so much look at the effects of capitalism and western media blah blah blah since it wasnt just that their fake market had comparable prices to the competitors it was that as many people in the film say the prices were absurdly low someone mentions that they shouldve known it was fake by how much they were charging for duck thats not proving anything except that people who are poor will go to a store that has low prices bravo fellas way to stick it to the people on the bottomway to play a stupid practical joke on elderly people you should be very proud how about for your next movie you make a documentary about iraq and show how people there will get really excited for a house without bullet holes in the walls and then say haha! no such house exists! your so stupid and loved to be lied to by the media!morgan please like me spurlock unleashed this wet fart of a film and its no surprise since spurlock as one hit wonder prince of the documentary world seems to throw his weight behind any silly sounding concept to stay relevant in a world that really has no need of himavoid like the plague<SEP>0
the kids i took to this movie loved it four children ages 9 to 12 years; they would have given it 10 stars emma roberts was adorable in the title role expect to see more of this next-generation roberts in the future after being over exposed to the likes of britney spears lindsay lohan and paris hilton it was refreshing to see a girl who didnt look like she worked the streets also enjoyed seeing a supporting cast that included tate donovan rachel leigh cook barry bostwick and monica parker with a cameo by bruce willis final takeaway: cute filmnote: i did not read the book series so my comments are based on the merits of the film alone<SEP>1
though i saw this movie years ago its impact has never left me stephen reas depiction of an invetigator is deep and moving his anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable everyone in the cast is amazing from sutherland who tries to accommodate him and provide ways for the police to coordinate their efforts to the troubled citizen x each day when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers i think of this film and the exhausting work the people do who try to find the killers<SEP>1
this movie is just another average action flick but it could have been so much better when the guns come out they really needed some choreography help someone like andy mcnabb - who made that brilliant action sequence in heat as they move up the street from the robbery - would have turned the dull action sequences into something special because the rest of the film was alright - predictable but watchable - better than you would expect from this type of movie then came the final scene the show-down the one we had been waiting for but was like watching something from the a-team in the 80s they shoot wildly nothing hits and they run around a house trying to kill each other - same old same old<SEP>0
a funny comedy from beginning to end! there are several hilarious scenes but its also loaded with many subtle comedic moments which is what made the movie for me creative story line with a very talented cast i thoroughly enjoyed it!<SEP>1
this movie is entertaining enough due to an excellent performance by virginia madsen and the fact that lindsey haun is lovely however the reason the movie is so predictable is that weve seen it all before ive havent read the book a mothers gift but i hope for britney and lynne spears sake it is completely different than this movie unless you consider ending a movie with what is essentially a music video an original idea the entire movie brings to mind the word plagiarized<SEP>0
as usual i am making a mad dash to see the movies i havent watched yet in anticipation of the oscars i was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my alley i can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz it has there is no story!! a group of guys meander around iraq one day they are here diffusing a bomb tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire no wait here they are back in bagdad there is no cohesive story at all the three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures by that i mean we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying we have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe and then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesnt follow the rules but has a soft spot for the precocious little iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers dvds what do you think is going to happen well do you think the cowboy soldier who doesnt follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade ways why yes! do you think the iraqi kid that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy why yes! there is no story here the script is juvenile and predictable! the camera is shaken around a lot to make it look artsy and for all of you who think this is such a great war picture go rent full metal jacket deerhunter or platoon dont waste time or money on this boring movie!<SEP>0

time for a rant eh: i thought spirit was a great movie to watch however there were a few things that stop me from rating it higher than a 6 or 7 im being a little bit generous with the 7point #1: matt damon aggravates me i was thinking what a dicky voice they got for the main character when i first heard him narrate - and then i realized it is matt damon the man bugs me so very bad - his performance in the departed was terrible and ruined the movie for me before the movie got a chance to ruin itself but thats another story for some other time as it almost did spirit i was able to get past this fact because of how little narration there actually was thankfullypoint #2: brian adams sucks the whole score was terrible the songs were unoriginal generic and poorly executed; not once did i find the music to fit; and the lyrics were terrible every time one of the lame songs came on i was turned off i almost thought id start hearing some patriotic propaganda slipped into the super-american freedom style lyrics i couldnt help but be reminded of those terrible patriotic songs that played on the radio constantly after 911 in light of the native american aspects of the film they should have gone with fitting music using right instruments not petty radio-hit teen-bop 14-year-old-girl crap i thought i was back in junior high school i cant believe no better could have been done--i refuse to had it not have been for this id rank the film up more with disney which knows a thing or two about originality ok dont bother saying what i know some of you are probably thinking ; too bad its a shame they couldnt have hired better musiciansi liked the art and animation except for some things here and there like sometimes the angles appear too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body thickdark lines mainly near the end there were often times when i thought they _tried too hard_ on the emotion and facial expressions and failed at drawing any real emotion but there were also times when the emotion ran thick anyhow many scenes were lazy and the layers were apparentok im falling asleep here so ill sum it up before i start making less sensenice try on an epic film it turned out mediocre though matt damon you suck!<SEP>1
the sopranos is perhaps the most mind-opening series you could possibly ever want to watch its smart its quirky its funny - and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people cant resist watching the best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters set in the subterranean world of the new york crime families for most of the time you really dont know whether the wise guys will stab someone in the back or buy them lunch further adding to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities - these are dangerous men most of them murderers but by god if you dont love them too ive laughed at their wisecracks been torn when theyve made err in judgement and felt scared at the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal the suburban setting of new jersey is absolutely perfect for this shows subtext - people arent always as they seem and the stark contrast between humdrum and the actions taken by these seemingly petty criminals weigh up to even the odds if you havent already you most definitely should<SEP>1
i always have a bit of distrust before watching the british period films because i usually find on them insipid and boring screenplays such as the ones of for example vanity fair or the other boleyn girl but with a magnificent production design european landscapes and those thick british accents which make the movies to suggest artistic value which they do not really havefortunately the excellent film the young victoria does not fall on that situation and it deserves an enthusiastic recommendation because of its fascinating story the excellent performances from emily blunt paul bettany and jim broadbent and the costumes and locations which unexpectedly make the movie pretty rich to the viewand i say unexpectedly because i usually do not pay too much attention to those detailsvictorian era was in my humble opinion one of the key points in contemporary civilization and not only on the social aspect but also in the scientific artistic and cultural onesbut i honestly did not know about the origins from that era very much and maybe because of that i enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic events which prepared the landing of modern era so muchi also liked the way in which queen victoria is portrayed which is as a young and intelligent monarch whose decisions were not always good but they were at least inspired by good intentionsi also found the depiction of the romance between victoria and prince albert very interesting because it is equally interested in the combination of intellects as well as in the emotions it evokesthe only fail i found on this movie is that screenwriter julian fellowes used some clichés of the romantic cinema on the love story something which feels a bit out of place on his screenplayi liked the young victoria very much and i really took a very nice surprise with iti hope more period films follow the example of this movie: the costumes and the landscapes should work as the support of an interesting story and not as the replacement of it<SEP>1
in the tradition of g-men the house on 92nd street the street with no name now comes the fbi story one of those carefully supervised films that showed the federal bureau of investigation in the best possible light while its 48 year director j edgar hoover was alive it would be showed in no other kind of lightthe book by don whitehead that this film is based on is a straight forward history of the bureau from its founding in 1907 until roughly the time the film the fbi story came out its important sometimes to remember there was an fbi before j edgar hoover headed it some of that time is covered in the film as wellbut warner brothers was not making a documentary so to give the fbi flesh and blood the fictional character of john chip hardesty was created hardesty as played by james stewart is a career fbi man who graduated law school and rather than go in practice took a job with the bureau in the early twentiesin real life the bureau was headed by william j burns of the burns private detective agency it was in fact a grossly political operation then as is showed in the film burns was on the periphery of the scandals of the harding administration when hoover was appointed in 1924 to bring professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence in he did just that through the hardesty family which is stewart and wife vera miles we see the history of the fbi unfold in addition we see a lot of their personal family history which is completely integrated into the fbis story itself stewart and miles are most assuredly an all american couple we follow the fbi through some of the cases stewart is involved with arresting ku klux klan members a plot to murder oil rich indians bringing down the notorious criminals of the thirties their involvement with apprehending nazi sympathizers in world war ii and against communist espionage in the cold warthere is a kind of prologue portion where stewart tells a class at the fbi academy before going into the history of the bureau as it intertwines with his own that involves a bomb placed on an airline by a son who purchased a lot of life insurance on his mother before the flight nick adams will give you the creeps as the perpetrator and the story is sadly relevant todayof course if the fbi story were written and produced today it would reflect something different and not so all american still the fbi does have a story to tell and it is by no means a negative onethe fbi story is not one of jimmy stewarts best films but its the first one i ever saw with my favorite actor in it so it has a special fondness for me if the whole fbi were made up jimmy stewarts id feel a lot better about it theres also a good performance by murray hamilton as his friend and fellow agent who is killed in a shootout with baby face nelsonvera miles didnt just marry stewart she in fact married the fbi as the film demonstrates its dated mostly but still has a good and interesting story to tell<SEP>1
dvd has become the equivalent of the old late night double-bill circuit the last chance to catch old movies on the verge of being completely forgotten like the border there were great expectations for this back in 1982  a script co-written by the wild bunchs walon green jack nicholson in the days when he could still act without semaphore and a great supporting cast harvey keitel warren oates valerie perrine tony richardson directing although he was pretty much a spent force by then  but now it doesnt even turn up on tv the material certainly offers a rich seam of possibilities for comment on the 80s american dreams of capitalism and conspicuous consumption with nicholsons border patrolman turning a blind eye to the odd drug deal or bit of people trafficking to finance his wifes relentless materialism until he rediscovers his conscience when he finds out his partners are also in the baby selling business unfortunately he never really gets his hands dirty barely even turning a blind eye before his decency rises to the surface the film feels always watered down as if too many rewrites and too many committees have left it neutered and sadly the recent dvd release is a missed opportunity to restore the original nihilistic ending where nicholson goes over the edge and firebombs the border patrol station that was cut after preview audiences found it too downbeat but which still featured prominently in the films trailerswhile that probably wasnt too convincing considering how low-key nicholsons crisis of conscience is in the film it had to be better than the crude reshot climax where the film abandons logic and even basic rules of continuity: at one point hes holding characters at gunpoint then hes somewhere else and theyre free trying to kill him one character goes from injured at his house to hopping around like a gazelle on the banks of the rio grande while valerie perrines character gets dumber on an exponential level the villains of the piece are disposed of with absurd ease and one impressive car stunt in time for a clumsily edited happy ending and you start wondering if you somehow found yourself watching another film entirely what makes it all the more clumsy is that the rest of the film is so flat and underwhelming that the sudden lurch into melodrama is all the more jarring unfortunately ry cooders beautiful title song across the borderline says it all much more economically but if you want to know the films real crime its completely wasting the great warren oates in a nothing bit part when even he cant make an impression you know somethings really wrong all in all all too easy to remember why i found this so forgettable at the time<SEP>0
andy goldsworthy is a taoist master of the first order expressing the way through his sublime ephemeral art indeed time and change is what his work is fundamentally about i bought his first book several years ago and my family has marveled at it many times so it was a treat to get to know the artist personally through this film he is just as patient and gentle as you would expect and has some wonderful things to say about the natural world the deepest of which are expressed in his occasional inability to say it in words at all he is like most children who play in the great outdoors alone if they do anymore creating things from sticks and sand and mud and snow before they outgrow it mr goldsworthy was given the gift and the mission to extend that sort of play to create profound visions of nature and to open our often weary eyes to it in brilliant new ways and always with the utmost respect gratitude and humor of a wandering and wondering monk<SEP>1
in what could have been seen as a coup towards the sexual revolution purposefully i use quotations for that word jean eustache wrote and directed the mother and the whore as a poetic damning critique of those who cant seem to get enough love if there is a message to this film- and id hope that the message would come only after the fact of what else this ben-hur length feature has to offer- its that in order to love honestly there has to be some level of happiness of real truth is it possible to have two lovers some can try but what is the outcome if no one can really have what they really want or feel they can even express to say what they want what is the truth in the relationships that alexandre jean-pierre leaud has with the women around him hes a twenty-something pseudo-intellectual not with any seeming job and he lives off of a woman marie bernadette lafont slightly older than him and is usually if not always his lover his last possible love-of-his-life left him and then right away he picks up a woman he sees on the street veronika françoise lebrun who perhaps reminds him of her soon what unfolds is the most subtly torrid love triangle ever put on film where the psychological strings are pulled with the cruelest words and the slightest of gestures at first we think it might be all about what will happen to alexandre but were mistaken the women are so essential to this question of love and sex that they have to be around talking on and on for something to sink inwere told that part of the sexual revolution in theory if not entirely in practice perhaps it was i cant say having not been alive in the period to see it first-hand was that freedom led to a lack of inhibitions but eustaches point if not entirely message is that its practically impossible to have it both ways: you cant have people love you and expect to get the satisfaction of ultimate companionship that arrives with f***ing as the characters refer over and over again the mother and the whores strengths as far as having the theme is expressing this dread beneath the promiscuity the lack of monogamy while also stimulating the intellect in the talkiest talk youve ever seen in a movie at the same time we see a character like alexandre who probably loves to hear himself talk whether its about some movie he saw or something bad from his past eustache makes it so that the film itself isnt pretentious- though it could appear to be- but that its about pretentiousness what lies beneath those who are covering up for their internal flaws what they need to use when theyre ultimately alone in the morning if you thought films like before sunrisesunset were talky relationship flicks you havent met this but as eustache revels in the dialogs these characters have sometimes trivial or deep or sexual or frank or occasionally extremely or in a subdued manner emotional its never ever uninteresting or boring on the contrary for those who cant get enough of a *good* talky film its exceptional while his style doesnt call out to the audaciousness that came with his forerunners in the nouvelle vague a dozen years beforehand eustaches new-wave touch is with the characters and then reverberating on themthis is realism with a spike of attitude with things at time scathing and sarcastic crude and without shame in expression all three of the actors are so glued to their characters that we cant ever perceive them as faking an emotion or going at all into melodrama its almost too good in naturalisticrealism terms but for eustaches material there is no other way around it luckily leaud delivers the crowning chip of his career of the period and both ladies particularly labrun as the whore veronika a claim she staggeringly refutes in the films climax of sorts in one unbroken shot and as another touch every so often the director will dip into a quiet moment of thought of a character sitting by themselves listening to a record and in contemplation or quiet agony this is probably the biggest influence on jim jarmusch who dedicated his film broken flowers to eustache and has one scene in particular that is lifted completely and lovingly in approach from the late parisiansad to say before i saw broken flowers i never heard of eustache or this film and procuring it has become quite a challenge not available on us dvd and on vhs so rare it took many months of tracking at various libraries not a minute of that time was wasted; the mother and the whore is truly beautiful work one of the best of french relationship dramas maybe even just one of the most staggeringly lucid ive seen from the country in general its complex its sweet its cold its absorbing and its very long perhaps too long its also satisfying on the kind of level that id compare to scenes from a marriage; true revelations about the human condition continue to arise 35 years after each films release<SEP>1
this movie offers nothing to anyone it doesnt succeed on any level the acting is horrible dull long-winded dribble they obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for complete garbage i cant believe what a laughable movie this was and im very sure rosario dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit a wowing nc-17 movie the problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the oc or something aimed at teens pathetic<SEP>0
what a long drawn-out pointless movie im sure that historically this film is delightful but as entertainment goes it just doesnt make the grade ralph fiennes has been in some fantastic movies the english patient schindlers list but this one was such a let-down it didnt seem to be going anywhere his character at the beginning was so shallow and uptight it amazes me that his sister would ever have been interested at all dont bother paying to rent this movie buy yourself a copy of the english patient instead<SEP>0
i only watched the first 30 minutes of this and what i saw was a total piece of crap the scenes i saw were as bad as an ed wood movie no it was a hundred times worse ed wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but thats not true; the idiot who directed this junk is the worst director everthe american cop has a german accent! the police station was a desk in a warehouse with a sign police station hanging on the wall there is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about ten feetthis cop pulls women over cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse he tells his cop partner to wait in the car then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag the cop partner thinks maybe something is not right that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women but he isnt sure if that is whats happening because - hes a moron! the dialog is totally stupid the acting is awful and the characters act in the stupidest manner i have ever seen on screen it is totally obvious to the cops partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it and yet the partner who is there all along doesnt know what is happening! the director of this film is a total hack i stopped the movie at 30 minutes because i couldnt take it anymore it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever started to watch and i wont waste anymore time on it writing this review absolutely worthless<SEP>0
this film was rather a disappointment after the very slow very intense and quite gory beginning the film begins to lose it too much plot leaves too little time for explanation and coming out of the theater i wondered what this was all about the characters remain shallow the story is not convincing at all most of it is déja vù stuff without hints of parody and there are some very cheesy parts like the young cop has to do dig up a body of course its night and it rains and he has to do it alone yawn! or the manifestation of the evil being nazis plus genetic manipulation wow thats really original there are some nice bits though like the fistfight scene mountain views and some running gags but though reno and vincent cassel do what they can thats definitely not worth it 3 out of 10<SEP>0
oh i heard so much good about this movie went to see it with my best friend shes female im male now please allow me a divergent opinion from the mainstream after the first couple of dozen take off your clothes we both felt a very strange combination of silliness and boredom we laughed at it not with it we dozed and would have been better off staying in bed we were convinced we had spent money in vain and we had the plot was incoherent and the characters were a group of people about whom it was impossible to care a waste of money a waste of celluloid this movie doesnt even deserve one out of ten votes but thats the lowest available im not sure why this movie has the reputation that it does of being excellent; i dont recommend it to anyone who has even a modicum of taste or intelligence<SEP>0
ive seen the thin man series -- powell and loy are definitely great but there is something awfully sweet about powell and arthurs chemistry in this flick jean arthur shines when she looks at powell there is an unmistakable undercurrent buzzing between them this film may not have the wit of the thin man series but undeniably makes up for it in charm while i watched it i thought for sure powell was carrying on an off-screen affair with arthur my friends thought the same this is one film where i wish i could step back in time to schmooze and lock lips with powell! there seems to be no end to his lovable playful smirks! powells character lawrence bradford is probably the closest thing to the perfect man okay this is sounding way too gushy but i cant help myself<SEP>1
this movie with the alternate title martial law 3 for some reason introduced me to jeff wincott for the first time and it was a great introduction although i had never heard of him before he seemed to be an excellent fighter the action scenes in this movie are great! there are lots of them too by the way the recruit fight at the peacekeepers hq is especially good theres just something about one single guy beating the crap out of a bunch of people thats really fun and for the rest of the cast: brigitte nielsen was a good choice for the villain roles like this fits her but others dont matthias hues also did a good job as always hes a great fighter and macho-like character and was a good rival for wincott in this movie<SEP>1
gayniggers from outer space is a short foreign film about black gay aliens who explore the galaxy until they stumble upon earth being gay their goal is to have a male-only universe in which all people are gay hence when they discover women or female creatures live on earth they are at first terrified; eventually they decide to eliminate all women on the planet and liberate the male populationan offensive title with a racist homophobic and sexist storyline albeit probably intended as a satire give this film some shock value however theres little substance underneath as another reviewer pointed out there are few jokes besides the characters names eg arminass; i think i laughed once at one small gay joke i think i got the point of the film quickly a satire of bad science fiction but after that i had had enough; i kept wanting the film to end already and it is a short film! not brilliant or particularly well-written<SEP>0
what can i say about the first film everyou cant rate this because its not supposed to be entertaining but if you have to rate it you should give it a 10 it is stunning to see moving images from the year 1895 this was one of the most important movies in history i wonder how it was to be one of the people who saw the first movie ever!<SEP>1
frequently voted chinas greatest film ever by chinese critics as well as chinese film enthusiasts from the outside and frankly i dont get it at all what i saw was one of the most generic melodramas imaginable blandly directed and acted with a complete shrew for a protagonist wei wei dont laugh is that shrew a young married woman who has suffered alongside her tubercular husband yu shi for the past several years it is post wwii and they live with the husbands teenage sister hongmei zhang in a dilapidated home with not much money the man had been wealthy when they married along comes the husbands old best friend wei li who also used to be the wifes boyfriend when they were teens she considers running away from her husband with this man while the husband pretty much remains oblivious thinking he may engage his little sister to his friend thats the set-up and it doesnt go anywhere you wouldnt expect it to ive actually seen the remake directed by blue kite director zhuangzhuang tian it runs a half hour longer and is actually kind of dull too but at least it was pretty this supposed classic is pretty intolerable<SEP>0
i believe a lot of people down rated the movie not because of the lack of quality but it did not follow the standard hollywood formula some of the conflicts are not resolved the ending is just a little too real for others but the journey the rich characters and long list of supporters provide is both thought provoking and very entertaining even the cinematography is excellent given the urban setting the directing also is excellent and innovativethis is a 10 in my book this movie will take you places the normal and expected hollywood script will not they took some risks and did a few things different i think it worked well i am purposely trying to avoid any direct references to the movie because seeing it for yourself is the best answer not accepting someone elses interpretation<SEP>1
poor ingrid suffered and suffered once she went off to italy tired of the hollywood glamor treatment first it was suffering the torments of a volcanic island in stromboli an arty failure that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress and now its europa 51 another tedious exercise in soggy sentimentnor does the story do much for alexander knox in another thankless role as her long-suffering husband who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death of their young son at least this one has better production values and a more coherent script than strombolibergman is still attractive here but moving toward a more matronly appearance as a rich society woman shes never able to cope over the sudden loss of her son despite attempts by a kindly male friend sometimes i think im going out of my mind she tells her husband a portentous statement in a film that is totally without humor or grace but it does give us a sense of where the story is goingbergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post-war rome but being a social worker with poor children doesnt improve her emotional health and from thereon the plot takes a turn for the worsethe films overall effect is that its not sufficiently interesting to make into a project for a major star like bergman the film loses pace midway through the story as bergman becomes more and more distraught and her husband suspects that shes two-timing him the story goes downhill from there after she nurses a street-walker through her terminal illness the final thread of plot has her husband needing to place her for observation in a mental asylumingrid suffers nobly through it all over-compensating for the loss of her son but its no use not one of her best flicks to put it mildlytrivia note: if she wanted neo-realism with mental illness she might have been better off accepting the lead in the snake pit when it was offered to her by director anatole litvak!! it would have done more for her career than europa 51summing up: another bleak indiscretion of rossellini and bergman<SEP>0
humphrey bogart clearly did not want to be in this film and be forced to play a part-mexican or he would have been suspended believe me he made the wrong choice! presumably after the success of dodge city warners tried a follow-up with errol flynn and his usual list of buddies like alan hale guinn big boy williams frank mc hugh and the ever-present john litel but they made the huge mistake of trying to present miriam hopkins as a love interest for flynn v randolph scott and as a singer to really make things bad because she proved one thing and that is she cannot sing the story was not too bad but with bogie clearly miscast also it turned out to be a poor western that was overlong and on a low budget but in fairness color would not have helped<SEP>0
in stand by me vern and teddy discuss who was tougher superman or mighty mouse my friends and i often discuss who would win a fight too sometimes we get absurd and compare guys like macgyver and the terminator or rambo and matrix but now it seems that we discuss guys like jackie chan bruce lee and jet li it is a pointless comparison seeing that lee is dead but it is a fun one and if you go by what we have seen from jet li in lethal 4 and black mask you have to at least say that he would match up well against chan in this film he comes across as a martial arts godblack mask is about a man that was created along with many other men to be supreme fighting machines their only purpose is to win wars that other people lose they are invincible in some ways now that is the premise for the film but what that does is sets up all the amazingly choreographed fight scenesjet li is a marvel he can do things with and to his body that no human being should be able to do and that is what makes watching him so funbesides the martial arts in the film black mask is strong with humour and that is due to the chemistry that jet has with his co-star the police officer they are great together but to be honest if anyone is reading this review they want to know if the film is kick ass in the action department and the answer to that is a resounding yes!!! lots and lots of gory mindless action you will love this film<SEP>1
i have read many comments on this site criticizing the blob for being cheesy and or campy the movie has been faulted for amateurish acting and weak special effects what would you expect from a group of folks whose only experience has been in the production of low budget locally produced valley forge pa christian shorts let me tell those overly critical reviewers that this film never took itself all that serious that fact should be evident from the mismatched theme music complete with silly lyrics played over the opening credits for what it was meant to be this film is excellent i have seen a few of the recent ultra low budget attempts blair witch project was one of them that have absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thought behind their plot bwp was pure excrement the blob on the other hand was well thought out well scripted and thoroughly entertaining the scene where the old man comes across the meteorite and pokes the mass contained within with a stick was excellently done and genuinely creepy the scene in the doctors office with the blob slowly moving under the blanket on the gurney while it consumed the old man was a cinematic horror masterpiece bottom line is i love this movie i challenge anyone out there to take $12000000 inflated for todays dollar value and make a film anywhere near as entertaining and or as successful as the blob it just cant be done period! thank you for taking time to read this review<SEP>1

well then thank you so much disney for destroying the fond memories i used to have of my former favorite movie i was about 5 when the original movie came out and it was one of the first movies i remember seeing so now that im 16 and feeling masochistic enough i decided to rent this movie thus i managed to poison all my memories of the original movie with this sorry excuse for a movie this movie takes everything that made the original endearing and wrecks it right down to the last detailin this movie ariel and eric celebrate the birth of their daughter melody and go to show her to everyone in the oceanbroadway style! after the musical number ends within minutes the sea witch morgana shows up and threatens to kill melody if triton doesnt give up the trident thus he gives it up without even a fight eric stands there gaping though ariel figures out how to use a sword and save melody morgana escapes so ariel and eric decide that melody should never go near the sea until morgana is caughtwelluh nothing of note really happens eric is a total wuss he never really manages to do anything ariel sort of does something melody manages to screw things up plus the animation is a new low-point for disney the computer graphics wind up clashing with the backgrounds ever single opportunity for character development is wasted the songs bitelook dont waste your time im pretty sure even the little kids are going to be bored out of their skulls with this since nothing even remotely exciting ever happens they wont want to sing the songs if you manage to grab a copy of this throw it out into the ocean and hope that nobody ever finds it ever<SEP>0
once in a while you get amazed over how bad a film can be and how in the world anybody could raise money to make this kind of crap there is absolutely no talent included in this film - from a crappy script to a crappy story to crappy acting amazing<SEP>0
this series had potential but i suppose the budget wouldnt allow it to see that potential an interesting setup not dissimilar to lost it falls flat after the 1st episode the whole series 6 episodes could have made a compelling 90 minute film but the makers chose to drag it on and on many of the scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving the action forward the music was very annoying and did not work overall there were few characters we cared about as their characters did not grow during the time frame--- well one grew a bit the ending was as terrible as the rest of series the only kudos here is to the art dept and set dressers they created an interesting look too bad the writer and director lacked the foresight to do something interesting with that element<SEP>0
happy go lovely is a waste of everybodys time and talent including the audience the lightness of the old-hat mistaken identity and faux scandal plot lines is eminently forgivable very few people watched these movies for their plots but they usually had some interesting minor characters involved in subplots -- not here they usually had interesting choreography and breathtaking dancing and catchy songs not happy go lovely and vera-ellen as the female lead played the whole movie as a second banana looking desperately for a star to play off it -- and instead she was called upon to carry the movie and couldnt do it the scottish locale was wasted usually automatically ubiquitous droll scottish whimsy is absent the photography was pedestrian the musical numbers were pedestrian cesar romero gives his usual professional performance chewing up the scenery since no one else was doing his part in the type of producer role essayed frequently by walter abel and adolph menjou david niven is just fine and no one could do david niven like david niven at the end of the day if you adore niven as i do its reason enough to waste 90 minutes on happy go lovely if not skip it<SEP>0

may seem far fetched but there really was a real life story of a man who had an affair with a woman who found out where he and his new wife were staying and she killed the wife making it look like a murder rapein her delusion she had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him so she quit her job in wisconsin and moved to minnesotalast i heard she was in a mental institution security prisonshe was still wearing the engagement ring that she has purchased for herself and had told everyone that he had bought it for herthe events took place in a small town in wisconsin and the murder happened in minnesotathere even was a feature story in people magazine spring of 1988 i want to say on page 39 i remember this as i was in college at the time and a colleague of mine had met the individual in the security hospital<SEP>0
when i first saw this movie the first thing i thought was this movie was more like an anime than a movie the reason is because it involves vampires doing incredible stunts the stunts are very much like the matrix moves like the moving too fast for bullets kinda thing and the jumping around very far another reason why i the movie is good is because the adorable anime faces they do during the movie the way gackt does his pouting faces or just the way they act very anime i think that its a really good movie to watch ^_^ the action in this movie is a 10 not to mention gackt and hyde too are a 10 ^_~ if you are gackt and hyde fans you have to see it<SEP>1
the arrival of vast waves of white settlers in the 1800s and their conflict with the native american residents of the prairies spelled the end for the buffalo the commercial killers however werent the only ones shooting bison train companies offered tourist the chance to shoot buffalo from the windows of their coaches there were even buffalo killing contests buffalo bill cody killed thousands of buffalo some u s government officers even promoted the destruction of the bison herds the buffalo nation was destroyed by greed and uncontrolled hunting few visionaries are working today to rebuild the once-great bison herds the last hunt holds one of robert taylors most interesting and complex performances and for once succeeded in disregarding the theory that no audience would accept taylor as a heavy guyhis characterization of a sadistic buffalo hunter who kills only for pleasure had its potential: the will to do harm to another when he is joined by his fellow buffalo stalker stewart granger it is evident that these two contrasted characters with opposite ideas will clash violently very soontaylors shooting spree was not limited to wild beasts he also enjoy killing indians who steal his horses he even tries to romance a beautiful squaw debra paget who shows less than generous to his needs and comfortamong others buffalo hunters are lloyd nolan outstanding as a drunken buffalo skinner; russ tamblyn as a half-breed; and constance ford as the dance-hall girl but taylor steals the show richard brooks captures in cinemascope and technicolor distant view of buffalos grazing upon the prairie as the slaughter of these noble animalsthe film is a terse brutish outdoor western with something to say about old western myths and a famous climax in which the bad guy freezes to death while waiting all night to gun down the hero<SEP>1
this film has been scaring me since the first day i saw itmy mum had watched it when it was on the telly back in 92 i remember being woken up in the middle of the night by her tearful ramblings as my dad helped her up the stairsshe was saying something like dont let her get me or something like that i asked what had made her so upset and she told me that shed been watching the woman in blackso obviously i had to watch it and even though i was only eleven she let me it scared the s*** out of me ive been immune to horror films since watching this!<SEP>1
this film has been on my wish list for ten years and i only recently found it on dvd when my partners grandson was given it he watched it at and was thrilled to learn that it was about my generation - born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939 and he wanted to know more about it - and me luckily i borrowed it from him and watched it on my own and i cried all through it not only did it capture the emotions the class distinction the hardship and the warmth of human relationships of those years as well as the cruelties spoken and unspoken; but it was accurate! i am also a bit of an anorak when it comes to arp uniforms ambulances lcc in the right colour white and all the impedimenta of the management of bomb sites and the work of the heavy rescue brigades i couldnt fault any of this from my memories and the sandbagged anderson shelter and the wvs canteens brought it all back the difference between the relatively unspoiled life in the village and war-torn london was also sharply presented i re-lived 193940 and my own evacuation from london with this production! i know jack golds work of course and one would expect no more from him than this meticulous detail; but it went far beyond the accurate representation of the facts and touched deep chords about human responses and the only half-uttered value judgements of those years it was certainly one of the great high spots in john thaws acting career and of golds direction and deserves to be better known it is a magnificent film and i have already ordered a couple of copies to send to friends<SEP>1
war inc - corporations take over war in the future and use a lone assassin brand hauser john cusack to do their wet-work against rival ceos a dark comedy satirizing the military and corporations alike it was often difficult to figure out what exactly was going on i kept waiting for things to make sense theres no reason or method to the madnessits considered by cusack to be the spiritual successor to grosse point blank ie war is more or less a knock-off we again see cusack as an assassin protecting *spoiler* the person hes supposed to kill as he grips with his conscience to be fair john cusack looks kind of credible taking out half a dozen guys with relative ease the brief fights look good the rest of the film does not its all quirky often bordering on bizarre war incs not funny enough to be a parody and too buoyant for anyone to even think about whatever the films message might be which i suppose might be the heartless ways that corporations like war factions compete and scheme without a drop of consideration given to how they affect average citizens interesting but the satire just doesnt work because its not funny and at its heart the film has no heart were supposed to give a damn about how war affects cusacks shell of a character rather than the millions of lives torn apart by warjohn cusack gives a decent performance his character chugs shots of hot sauce and drives the tiniest private plane but quirks are meant to replace character traits marisa tomei is slumming as the romantic sidekick journalist there really isnt a lot of chemistry between them hilary duff tries a russian accent and doesnt make a fool of herself joan cusack just screams and whines and wigs out blech ben kingsley might have to return the oscar if he doesnt start doling out a decent performance now and again patheticits not a terrible movie but in the end you gotta ask war what is it good for absolutely nothing c-<SEP>0
this film has got to be ranked as one of the most disturbing and arresting films in years it is one of the few films perhaps the only one that actually gave me shivers: not even pasolini´s sálo to which this film bears comparison affected me like that i saw echoes in the film from filmmakers like pasolini fassbinder and others i had to ask myself what was it about the film that made me feel like i did i think the answer would be that i was watching a horror film but one that defies or even reverses the conventions of said genre typically in a horror film horrible and frightening things will happen but on the margins of civilized society: abandoned houses deserted hotels castles churchyards morgues etc this handling of the subject in horror is i think a sort of defence mechanism a principle of darkness and opacity functioning as a sort of projective space for the desires and fears of the viewer so from this perspective hundstage is not a horror film; it takes place in a perfectly normal society and so doesn´t dabble in the histrionics of the horror film but what you see is the displacement of certain key thematics from the horror genre especially concerning the body and its violation the stages of fright and torture it can be put through what seidl does is to use the settings of an everyday middle class society as a stage on which is relayed a repetitious play of sexual aggression loneliness lack and violation of intimacy and integrity: precisely the themes you would find in horror but subjected to a principle of light and transparency from which there is no escape it is precisely within this displacement that the power of seidl´s film resides hundstage deals with these matters as a function of the everyday displays them in quotidian repetition rather than as sites of extremity and catharsis - a move you would encounter in said horror genre one important point of reference here is rainer werner fassbinder fassbinder also had a way of blending the political with the personal in his films a tactics of the melodrama that allowed him to deal in a serious and even moral way with political issues like racism domination desire questions concerning ownership sexual property and control fascism and capitalism etc seidl´s tactic of making the mechanisms of everyday society the subject of his film puts him in close proximity with fassbinder; like this german ally he has a sort of political vision of society that he feels it is his responsibility to put forward in his films during a seminar at the gothenburg film festival this year at which seidl was a guest he was asked why he would have so many instances of violated subjugated women in hundstage but no instances of a woman fighting back liberating herself seidl replied that some may view it as immoral to show violence against women but that he himself felt it would be immoral not to show it an artistic statement as good as any i think thank you<SEP>1
excellent comedy starred by dudley moore supported by liza minnelli and good-speaking john gielgud moore is arthur a man belonging to a multimillionaire family who was near to get 750 million dollars provided that he marries to a lady susan from another multimillionaire family in principle arthur accepted the conditions but he finally refused when he met nice and poor linda marolla liza minneli arthur was just a parasite because he did not work he only enjoyed himself drinking hard and having fun with prostitutes after several serious thoughts in his life and for the first time arthur decided not to marry susan only few minutes before their wedding the end was happy for linda and arthur although the latter knew that his life will change in the coming future this comedy is a good lesson for life for anyone rich people are not usually happy with their ways of life<SEP>1
thats not just my considered verdict on this film but also on the bulk of what has been written about it now dont get me wrong here either im not a total philistine i didnt hate the movie because it wasnt enough like police academy 9 or whatever i enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff i swearmagnolia is poor and i am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed long winded self indulgent rambling nonsense from start to finish there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie theres some high calibre actors fair enough and none turns in an average or worse performance furthermore my wife a self confessed tom cruise hater tells me its his career best performance by far but the plot is so completely unengaging meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snails pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or somethingit doesnt help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with well i didnt think so but i dont like most people admittedly they all play out their rather unentertaining life stories at great length demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever-so intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en route yadda yadda yadda the soundtracks dire as well with that marrow-suckingly irritating quality that i had hitherto thought unique to the music of alanis morisetteall in all it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of friends whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat the bit with the frogs is good though<SEP>0
of course if you are reading my review you have seen this film already raja babu is one of my most favorite characters i just love the concept of a spoiled brat with a 24*7 servant on his motorcycle watch movies and emulate characters etc etc i love the scene when a stone cracks in kader khans mouth while eating also where shakti kapoor narrates a corny story of raja babus affairs on a dinner table and govinda wearing dharam-veer uniform makes sentimental remarks thats my favorite scene of the film achcha pitaji to main chalta hoon scene is just chemistry between two great indian actors doing a comical scene with no dialogs its brilliant its a cat mouse film just watch these actors helping each other and still taking away the scene from each other its total entertainment if you like govinda and kader khan chemistry then its a must i think rb is 6th in my list by david dhawan deewana mastana ankheinshola or shabnam swarg coolie no 1 precedes this gem of a film 710<SEP>1
this movie is bad i dont just mean bad as in; oh the script was bad or; the acting in that scene was badi mean bad as in someone should be held criminally accountable for foisting this unmitigated pile of steaming crud onto an unsuspecting public i wont even dignify it with an explanation of the plot if i can refer to it as thati can think of only one other occasion in some 40-odd years of movie watching that i have found need to vent my spleen on a movie i mean after all no one goes out to intentionally make a bad movie do they well yes apparently they doand the guilty man is writerdirector ulli lommel but the worst of it is that blockbusters is actually renting this to their customers! be advised leave this crap where it belongs stuck on the shelf gathering dust<SEP>0
if saura hadnt done anything like this before iberia would be a milestone now it still deserves inclusion to honor a great director and a great cinematic conservator of spanish culture but he has done a lot like this before and though we can applaud the riches he has given us we have to pick and choose favorites and high points among similar films which include blood wedding 1981 carmen 1983 el amore brujo 1986 sevillanas 1992 salomé 2002 and tango 1998 i would choose sauras 1995 flamenco as his most unique and potent cultural document next to which iberia palesiberia is conceived as a series of interpretations of the music of isaac manuel francisco albéniz 1860-1909 and in particular his iberia suite for piano isaac albéniz was a great contributor to the externalization of spanish musical culture -- its re-formatting for a non-spanish audience he moved to france in his early thirties and was influenced by french composers his iberia suite is an imaginative synthesis of spanish folk music with the styles of liszt dukas and dindy he traveled around performing his compositions which are a kind of beautiful standardization of spanish rhythms and melodies not as homogenized as ravels bolero but moving in that direction naturally the spanish have repossessed albéniz and in iberia the performers reinterpret his compositions in terms of various more ethnic and regional dances and styles but the source is a tamed and diluted form of spanish musical and dance culture compared to the echt spanishness of pure flamenco flamenco coming out of the region of andalusia is a deeply felt amalgam of gitane hispano-arabic and jewish cultures iberia simply is the peninsula comprising spain portugal andorra and gibraltar; the very concept is more diluted sauras flamenco is an unstoppably intense ethnic mix of music singing dancing and that peacock manner of noble preening that is the essence of spanish style the way a man and a woman carries himself or herself with pride verging on arrogance and elegance and panache -- even bullfights and the moves of the torero are full of it -- in a series of electric sequences without introduction or conclusion; they just are saura always emphasized the staginess of his collaborations with choreographer antonio gades and other artists in his 1995 flamenco he dropped any pretense of a story and simply has singers musicians and dancers move on and off a big sound stage with nice lighting and screens flats and mirrors arranged by cinematographer vittorio storaro another of the spanish filmmakers important collaborators the beginnings and endings of sequences in flamenco are often rough but atmospheric marked only by the rumble and rustle of shuffling feet and a mixture of voices sometimes the film keeps feeding when a performance is over and you see the dancer bend over sigh or laugh; or somebody just unexpectedly says something in flamenco more than any of sauras other musical films its the rapt intense interaction of singers and dancers and rhythmically clapping participant observers shouting impulsive olés that is the story and creates the magic because saura has truly made magic and perhaps best so when he dropped any sort of conventional storyiberia is in a similar style to some of sauras purest musical films: no narration no dialogue only brief titles to indicate the type of song or the region beginning with a pianist playing albenizs music and gradually moving to a series of dance sequences and a little singing in flamenco music the fundamental element is the unaccompanied voice and that voice is the most unmistakable and unique contribution to world music it relates to other songs in other ethnicities but nothing quite equals its raw raucous unique ugly-beautiful cry that defies you to do anything but listen to it with the closest attention then comes the clapping and the foot stomping and then the dancing combined with the other elements there is only one flamenco song in iberia if you love sauras flamenco youll want to see iberia but youll be a bit disappointed the style is there; some of the great voices and dancing and music are there but iberias source and conception doom it to a lesser degree of power and make it a less rich and intense cultural experience<SEP>1
wow! so much fun! probably a bit much for normal american kids and really its a stretch to call this a kids film this movie reminded me a quite a bit of time bandits - very terry gilliam all the way through while the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward miike still throws in a lot of surreal and bunuel-esquire moments the whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kidhero with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of miikes work the layers of meaning and metaphor particularly the anti-war anti-revenge message of human folly is pretty damn poignant as manic and imaginatively fun as other great miike films only instead of over the top torture and gore he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from japanese folk-lore creatively conceived via cg and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multi-faceted adventure fn rad and one of miikes best!<SEP>1
running only seventy-two minutes this small overlooked 2006 dramedy is really just a two-character sketch piece but one that works very well within its limitations taking place almost entirely in various non-descript spots in southern los angeles the story itself is inconsequential but like sofia coppolas lost in translation the film is far more about two strangers who meet unexpectedly find a common bond and go back to their lives enlightened for the momentous encounter it also helps considerably that morgan freeman and paz vega are playing the characters finally freed of the wise sages and authority figures beyond reproach that have become his big-screen specialty freeman seems comparatively liberated as a somewhat self-indulgent movie star his character is driven to a low-rent grocery store in carson where he will be able to research a role he is considering in an indie filmout of work for a few years he is embarrassed when he sees dvds of his films in the bargain bin but his ego is such that he does not lack the temerity to watch and even mimic the enervated store staff of particular fascination to him is scarlet an embittered worker from spain and relegated to the express line where she is the unsung model of efficiency she has an interview for a secretarial job at a construction company but her deep-seeded insecurity seems to defeat her chances already still looking like penelope cruzs amazonian sister the beautiful vega one of the few redeemable aspects of james l brooks execrable spanglish brings a stinging edge and realistic vulnerability to scarlet she and freeman interplay very well throughout the story which includes stops not only at the grocery store but also at target arbys and a full-service carwash nothing earth-shattering happens except to show how two people realize the resonating transience of chance encounterssilberling keeps the proceedings simple but the production also reflects expert craftsmanship in phedon papamichaels vibrant cinematography he lensed alexander paynes sideways and the infectious score by brazilian composer antonio pinto city of god there are fast cameos by bobby cannavale as scarlets soon-to-be-ex-husband and as themselves danny devito and rhea perlman as well as a funny bits with jonah hill knocked up as the clueless driver and jim parsons the knight in garden state as a worshipful receptionist the 2007 dvd is overstuffed with extras including a making-of documentary 15 days or less aimed at film students and running a marathon 103 minutes; six extended scenes; a light-hearted but insightful three-way conversation between silberling freeman and vega in the middle of target; and a couple of snippets that specifically advertise the dvd<SEP>1
this worldwide was the cheap mans version of what the nwa under jim crockett junior and jim crockett promotions made back in the 1980s on the localized big 3 stations during the saturday morningafternoon wrestling craze when ted turner got his hands on crocketts failed version of nwa he turned it into world championship wrestling and proceeded to drop all nwa references all together nwa world wide and nwa pro wrestling were relabeled with the wcw logo and moved off the road to disneymgm studios in orlando florida and eventually became nothing more than recap shows for wcws nitro thunder and saturday night worldwide was officially the last wcw program under turner to air the weekend of the wcw buyout from vince mcmahon and wwf today the entire nwa world widewcw worldwide video tape archive along with the entire nwawcw video tape library in general lay in the vaults of wwe headquarters in stamfordconnecticut<SEP>0
trite clichéd dialog and plotting the same kind of stuff we saw all through the 1980s fantasy movies hokey music and a paint-by-numbers characters knocks this out of the running for all but the most hardcore fanswhat saves this film from the junk heap is the beautiful crutch of bakshis work the rotoscoping and the fact that frank frazetta taught the animators how to draw like him this is frazettain motion the violence is spectacular and the art direction and animation are unlike any other sword & sorcery movie of the periodi like to watch this with the sound off playing the soundtrack to the first conan movie instead<SEP>0
i first saw this movie at a festival there were many good movies but few kept me thinking about it long after and an insomniacs nightmare was definitely one of them tess is definitely a gifted filmmaker the shots were great casting was perfect dominic shined in his role that she perfectly crafted there wasnt a lot to know about his character but she wrote the story in such a way that we cared about him and ellen-- i cant wait to see where she ends up! shes showing a lot of talent and i hope she does a few more films with all the million dollar budgets trying to get a cheap thrill tess shows that its all not needing as long as there is a good story and actors kudos to everyone involved with this film and thanks to tess and co for distributing it on dvd!<SEP>1
as i am no fan of almost any post-desperate living john waters films i warmed to pecker after he emerged from the underground waters produced trash-lite versions of his earlier works cry baby polyester hairspray that to die-hard fans looked and tasted like watered down liqueur pecker which doesnt attempt to regurgitate early successes is a slight quiet humble commentary on the vagaries of celebrity and the pretentiousness of the art world waters clearly knows this subject well because he has also exhibited and sold at ridiculous prices some of the most amateurish pop art ever created that you couldnt imagine anyone being able to give away if it wasnt emblazoned with the waters name edward furlong is fine as pecker and waters non-histrionic style is at ease with the subject<SEP>1
this isnt the best romantic comedy ever made but it is certainly pretty nice and watchable its directed in an old-fashioned way and that works fine cybill shepherd as corinne isnt bad in her role as the woman who cant get over her husbands death she has a sexy maturity but i cant say much for ryan oneal as philip because he is at best nondescript he may be adequate in the role but thats not good enoughhowever i get the feeling that some of the characters particularly alex and miranda are not written with enough in-depth thought we dont know anything else about them because minutes after they appear the story gets thick and the writers dont tell us much beyond what happens but that problem was salvaged because mary stuart masterson has a fresh-as-a-daisy sweetness to brighten it up and robert downey jr is so charming that he melts the screen even his smile is infectious and it so happens that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for the deja vu and flashback scenesanyway this movie is light and easy and if you like them that way why not give it a try<SEP>1
the film had many fundamental values of family and love it expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story the script was clear it was very easy to understand making it perfect for childrenand was enjoyable and humorous at times there were a few charged symbols to look for the cinematography was acceptable there was no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinematographers have been doing todaywhich quiet frankly is getting a little warn out it was plainly filmed but had a nice soft quality to it although editing could have been done better i thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy and the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something i didnt like either but in all it was a good movie<SEP>1
to bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as braveheart though it is a very different kind of film the conflict between scottish commoners and english nobility is front and center here as well roughly 400 years had passed between the time braveheart took place and rob roy was set but some things never seemed to change scottland is still run by english nobles and the highlanders never can seem to catch a break when dealing with them rob roy is handsomely done but not the grand epic that braveheart was there are no large-scale battles and the conflict here is more between individuals and helpfully so not all englishmen are portrayed as evil this time rob roy is simply a film about those with honor and those who are truly evilliam neeson plays the title character rob roy macgregor he is the leader of the macgregor clan and his basic function is to tend to and protect the cattle of the local nobleman of record known as the marquis of montrose john hurt things look pretty rough for the macgregor clan as winter is approaching and there seems to be a lack of food for everyone rob roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the marquis and purchase some cattle of his own he would then sell them off for a higher price and use the money to improve the general well-being of his community sounds fair enough doesnt it problems arise when two cronies of the marquis steal the money for themselves one of them known as archibald cunningham is perhaps the most evil character ever put on film played wonderfully by tim roth this man is a penniless would-be noble who has been sent to live with the marquis by his mother this man is disgustingly effeminate rude heartless and very dangerous with a sword he fathers a child with a hand maiden and refuses to own up to the responsibility he rapes macgregors wife and burns him out of his home this guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come along with another crony of the marquis brian cox cunningham steals the money and uses it to settle his own debts though it is painfully obvious to most people what happened the marquis still holds macgregor to the debt this sets up conflict that will take many lives and challenge the strengths of a man simply fighting to hold on to his dignityspoilers ahead!!!!!luckily for the macgregors a duke who is no friend to the marquis sets up a final duel between rob roy and cunningham to resolve the conflict one and for all this sword fight has been considered by many to be one of the best ever filmed cunningham is thought by many to be a sure winner with his speed and grace and for most of the fight it looks like these attributes will win out just when it looks like rob roy is finished he turns the tables in a shockingly grotesque manner the first time you see what happens you will probably be as shocked as cunningham! rob roy is beautifully filmed wonderfully acted and perfectly paced the score is quite memorable too the casting choices seem to have worked out as jessica lange who might seem to be out of her element actually turns in one of the strongest performances as mary macgregor the film is violent but there isnt too much gore it is a lusty picture full of deviant behavior however the nobility are largely played as being amoral and sleazy the film has no obvious flaws thus it gets 10 of 10 starsthe hound<SEP>1
its a very nice movie and i would definitely recommend it to everyone but there are 2 minus points: - the level of the stories has a large spectrum some of the scenes are very great and some are just boring - a lot of stories are not self-contained if you compare to fe coffee and cigarettes where each story has a point a message a punchline or however you wanna call it but well most stories are really good some are great and overall its one of the best movies this year for sure!annoying that i have to fill 10 lines at minimum i havent got more to say and i dont want to start analyzing the single sequenceswell i think thats it!<SEP>1
meaning: if this movie got pitched scripted made released promoted as something halfway respectable given the constraints yeah i know springer sex violence where is hereminded me of porn movies i saw in college plot and dialogue wise shoulda just done something for the scurrilous porno market showed penetration and be done with it-- would have made more money the ultimate point of this exercise<SEP>0
this movie will tell you why amitabh bacchan is a one man industry this movie will also tell you why indian movie-goers are astute buyersamitabh was at the peak of his domination of bollywood when his one-time godfather prakash mehra decided to use his image yet again prakash has the habit of picking themes and building stories out of it adding liberal doses of bollywood sensibilities and clichés to it zanzeer saw the making of angry young man lawaris was about being a bastard and namak halal was about the master-servant loyalties but then the theme was limited to move the screenplay through the regulation three hours of song dance and drama what comprised of the movie is a caricature of a haryanavi who goes to mumbai and turns into a regulation hero amitabhs vocal skills and diction saw this movie earn its big bucks thanks to his flawless stock haryanvi accent to me this alone is the biggest pull in the movie the rest all is typical bollywood screen writingamitabh by now had to have some typical comedy scenes in each of his movies thanks to manmohan desai this movie had a good dose of them the shoe caper in the party the monologue over vijay merchant and vijay hazares considerations the mosquito challenge in the boardroom and the usual drunkard scene that by now has become a standard amitabh fareshashi kapoor added an extra mile to the movie with his moody finicky character remember him asking ranjeet to shaaadaaaap after the poisoned cake incident his was the all important role of the master while amitabh was his loyal servant but prakash mehra knew the indian mindand so shashi had to carry along his act with the rest of the movie it was one character that could have been more developed to make a serious movie but this is a caper remember and as long as it stayed that way the people came and saw amitabh wearing a new hat and went back home happy the end is always predictable and the good guys get the gal and the bad ones go to the gaol the age-old theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and all is well that ends wellso what is it that makes this movie a near classic amitabh bacchan as the haryanvi prakash mehra created yet another icon in the name of a story chuck the story the characters and the plot my marks are for amitabh alone<SEP>1
shame really - very rarely do i watch a film and am left feeling disappointed at the end ive seen quite a few of ira levins adaptations - rosemarys baby and the stepford wives - and liked both them but this just didnt appeal to mewhen i read the plot outline - an award winning playwright michael caine decides to murder one of his former pupils christopher reeve and steel his script for his own success - i was excited i like thrillers michael caines a good actor sidney lumets a good director and ira levins work is generally goodi wont spoil it for anyone who hasnt seen it yet but all id say is there are loads of twists and turns so many its kind of hard to explain the films plot line in detail without giving it away i enjoyed the first 45 minutes before the twists and turns began to occur and at that point my interest and enjoyment began to fade out though i have to give lumet credit for the very amusing ending which did make me laugh out loudthe main cast - michael caine christopher reeve dyan cannon and irene worth - were all brilliant in their roles though worths obvious fake russian accent got on my nerves slightly nothing personal irene i think any actors fake accent would irritate me not sure if cannons character was meant to be annoyingly funny but dyan managed to annoy and amuse - at the same timeanyone reading this - i dont want you to be put-off watching this because of my views - give it a chance you may like it you may not its all about opinion<SEP>0
after the debacle of the first sleepaway camp who thought that a franchise could be born sc ii is superior in aspect more inspired killings and just whole lot more fun while that might not be saying much compared to the first movie sleepaway camp ii is worth the rentalpros: entertaining doesnt take itself too seriously like sc i inspired killings cons: crappy acting and mullets aboundbottom line: 510<SEP>0
this is a cute little horror spoofcomedy featuring cassandra peterson aka elvira: mistress of the dark the most infamous horror hostess of all time this was meant to be the pilot vehicle for elvira and was so successful that it was picked up by the nbc network they filmed a pilot for a television series to feature the busty babe in black but unfortunately the sit-com never made it past the pilot stage due to its sexual references this film however is very amusing elvira is the modern-day chesty morgan and the queen of the one-liners this film was followed up a few years later by the abysmal elviras haunted hills which was meant to be a take-off of the old roger corman movies but falls flat on its face watch this movie instead for a much more entertaining experience!<SEP>1
i think that this movie is very neat you eithier like michael jackson or you dont but if you like him then you have to see this movie i think that it is a very neat film with great song play and good imagination not to mention the film center piece smooth criminal which has some of the best dancing you will every see<SEP>1
i could not agree more with the quote this is one of the best films ever made if you think vanilla sky is simply a re-make you could not be more wrong there is tremendous depth in this film: visually musically and emotionallyvisually because the film is soft and delicate at times early scenes with sofia and at other times powerful and intense times square post-climactic scenesthe music and sounds tie into this movie so perfectly without the music the story is only half told nancy wilson created an emotional yet eclectic score for the film which could not be more suitable for such a dream-like theme although never released i was able to get my hands on the original score for about $60 if you look hard you may be able to find a copy yourself crowes other musical selections such as the beach boys josh rouse spiritualized sigur ros the monkees etcetera etcetera are also perfect fits for the film crowe has an ear for great musicmore importantly the emotional themes in this film ie love sadness regret are very powerful and are amplified tenfold by the visual and musical experience as well as the ingenious dialogue; i admit the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes time and time againthe best part of this film however as if it could get any better is that it is so intelligently crafted such that each time you see the film you will catch something new--so watch closely and be prepared to think! sure a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch but there is always more to the story than you thinkthis is easily cameron crowes best work and altogether a work of brilliance much of my film-making and musical inspiration comes from this work alone it has honestly touched my life as true art has a tendency of doing it continually surprises me that there are many people that cannot appreciate this film for what it is i guess to understand true art is an art itselfbottom line: vanilla sky is in a league of its own<SEP>1
the american humane association which is the source of the familiar disclaimer no animals were harmed the registered trademark of the aha began to monitor the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago after a blindfolded horse was forced to leap to its death from the top of a cliff for a shot in the film jesse james 1939 needless to say the atrocious act kills the whole entertainment aspect of this film for me i suppose one could say that at least the horse didnt die in vain since it was the beginning of the public waking up to the callous and horrendous pain caused animals for the glory of movie making but i cant help but feel that if the poor animal had a choice this sure wouldnt have been the path he would have taken!<SEP>0
hilariously obvious drama about a bunch of high school i think kids who enjoy non-stop hip-hop break dancing graffiti and trying to become a dj at the roxy--or something to be totally honest i was so bored i forgot! even people who love the music agree this movie is terribly acted and--as a drama--failed dismally were supposed to find this kids likable and nice i found them bland and boring the one that i really hated was ramon he does graffiti on subway trains and this is looked upon as great excuse me hes defacing public property that isnt his to begin with also these great kids tap into the citys electricity so they can hold a big dance party at an abandoned building uh huh so were supposed to find a bunch of law breakers lovable and funi could forgive all that if the music was good but i cant stand hip hop the songs were--at best--mediocre and they were nonstop! theyre always playing! it got to the point that i was fast-forwarding through the many endless music numbers cut out the music and you haver a 30 minute movie--maybe there are a few imaginative numbers--the subway dance fight a truly funny santa number and the climatic roxy show if you love hip hop heres your movie but it youre looking for good drama mixed in--forget it also how did this get a pg rating theres an incredible amount of swearing in this<SEP>0
i last read a nancy drew book about 20 years ago so much of my memory of the fictional character is probably faulty from what i gathered the books were introduced to me at an era when teenage sleuths were popular to children growing up at the time for my case the 80s and early 90s with hardy boys famous five and of course carolyn keenes nancy drew amongst the more famous ones i still remember those hardcover books with very dated cover illustrations usually quite heavy for a kid to lug around and the thickness of the book perhaps attributed to the fact that the words are printed in large fontswell the character has been given some updates along the way as i recall my sisters subsequent nancy drew books becoming less thick of softcover with updated and a more chic nancy illustrated on the cover i cant remember if those stories were the same as the old hardcover ones but i guess these books being ghostwritten have their fair share of updating itself for the timesin this warner brothers release of nancy drew the character no doubt gets its update to suit the times but somehow the writers andrew fleming and tiffany paulsen maintained her 50s- ish small town sensibilities thereby retaining some charm and flavour that erm folks like me would appreciate her fashion sense her prim and properness even some quirky little behaviour traits that makes her well nancy drewher family background remains more or less the same living with her single parent father carson drew tate donovan who is moving his daughter and himself to the big city for a better job opportunity and to wean his daughter off sleuthing in the town of river heights mom is but a distant memory and the housemaid makes a cameo but what made nancy drew work is the casting of emma roberts in the lead role niece of her famous aunt julia she too possess that sprightly demeanour that unmistakable red hair and that megawatt smile her nancy drew while in the beginning does seem to rub you the wrong way actually will grow on you and in almost what i thought could be a discarded scene from pretty woman it had the characters walk into a classy shop with almost opposite reactionswhile dad carson drew tries hard to bring nancy out of her sleuthing environment and to assimilate into normal teenage life trust nancy to find themselves living in a house whose owner a hollywood type has been was found murdered under suspicious circumstances mystery solving is her comfort food when she finds herself an outcast of the local fraternity and not before long were whisked off along with her on her big screen adventuretheres nothing too black dahlia about the crime and mystery and instead its a pretty straightforward piece for nancy to solve in between befriending corky josh flitter a chubby friend from school and pacifying jealous boyfriend ned max thieriot while hiding the truth of her extra curriculum activities from her dad the storys laced with cheesy fun and an oldie sentimentality which charms and together it becomes somewhat scooby-doo like with minimal violence and no big bag gunfights or explosions this is seriously a genre which is labelled clearly with chick flick alerti guess the movie will generate a new generation of fans rekindle the memories of old ones and probably just probably might spark a new fashion trend of sporting penny loafers<SEP>1
this movie was a horrible excuse fora movie first of all the casting could have been better; katelyn the main character looked nothing like her tv mom also the plot was pathedic it was extremely cliché and predictable the ending was very disappointing and cheesy but thats all ill say about that the nail in the bag though was a scene when katelyn jordan hinson was supposed to be crying but the girl couldnt cry on command! there were no tears streaming down her face just a few unbelievable sobs she is not a dynamic actress at all she gave the same fake little laugh identical to that of hillary duff on lizzie maguire sp thats when the movie went from not-so-good to just plain bad it really looked like she was acting in a nutshell: this movie was really bad! it was kind of a mix of every cliché kid movie from the 1990s that everyones sick of--only worse!i give it an f because it was just so darn hard to sit through btw i was babysitting when i saw it however you may like it if your 9 or under ;<SEP>0
this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the british film industry but the talentless hacks at work today not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of british actors so what went wrong i dont know and simply i dont care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot a nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and co-worker out of his fathers company and thus leads to an encounter with the russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid very stupid plot twistsdevices i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather what about lock stock thats the peak of the contemporary british crime film<SEP>0
i went into this movie knowing nothing about it and ended up really enjoying it it lacked authenticity and believability- some of the things that the characters said and did were completely bizarre and a lot of the script seemed like it was ad-libbed perhaps this is typical of woody allen excuse my ignorance but the whole audience in the theater was laughing so hard it wasnt even at the jokes in the movie per se but at the whole movie itself the acting reminded me of seinfelds acting where he tries not to laugh at his own jokes- they are corny but if you dont take the movie too seriously you can really appreciate the humour of the actors not the characters if youre looking for a random movie and you like woody allen id definitely recommend it!<SEP>1
with movies like this you know you are going to get the usual jokes concerning ghosts eva as a ghost is pretty funny and the other actors also do a good job it is the direction and the story that is lacking that could have been overlooked had the jokes worked better the problem only is that there arent many jokes sure i laughed a couple of times apart from the talking parrot there wasnt an ounce of creativity to be noticed in the movie i blame the director not using the premise to its full potential eva certainly has the comedic skill to show more but did not get the opportunity to do so overall this movie is ideal for a sunday afternoon other than that it can be skipped completely<SEP>0
a christmas story is a holiday classic and my favorite movie so naturally i was elated when this movie came out in 1994 i saw it opening day and was prepared to enjoy myself i came away revolted and digusted the anticipation that rang true in a christmas story is curiously missing from this mess a red ryder bb gun is better to get than a chinese topand it is not very funny at all charles grodin is good but the buck stops there bottom line:1 star dont even bother<SEP>0
i need to be honest i watched and enjoy this show because it was gross offensive hilarious and raunchy yeah there is a lot of humor for all tastes if you are into the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people falling from skateboards for example then you will have a great time for itor if you enjoy people on extreme stunt actions going bad you will also have a great time and if you enjoy scatological humor and extreme situations oh you will enjoy the showi enjoy all three kinds of humor that dirty sànchez offers i like to have a hard laugh with the situations of the show jackass is like a walk in the park compared to this one so if you are tired of the typical american stupidity of jackass give it a try to english extreme stupidity on this show with all due respectthis is a show that has little taste or class its not recommended for those who are easily offended or grossed outnow these guys need to see a psychologist specially the paco character<SEP>1
oh dear lord how on earth was any part of this film ever approved by anyone it reeks of cheese from start to finish but its not even good cheese its the scummiest moldiest most tasteless cheese there is and i cannot believe there is anyone out there who actually truly enjoyed it yes if you saw it with a load of drunkstoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen i watched it with an up-for-a-few-laughs guy having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the films expected crapness we got the crapness plenty of it but not the chuckles it doesnt even qualify as a so-bad-its-good movie its just plain bad very very bad heres why look away if youre spoilerphobic: the movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death ok i was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was but i think i grasped the this guy is a bit of a badass who you dont want to mess with message behind the ingenious scene oh and a guy witnesses it so we already have our ultra-evil bad guy and wussy but cute apparently good guy cue hero big sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish ie hero is immune to bullets everyone else falls over rather clumsily cue first plot hole how the bloody hell did sammy know where this guy was or that hed watched the murder perhaps this and the answers to all my plot-hole related questions was explained in the 2 minutes before i got into the cinema but i doubt it in fact im going to stop poking holes in the plot right here lest i turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese which we all know is good cheese so the plot a very generous word to use good guy must get to la evil guy would rather he didnt hero sam stands between the two cue scenery for the next vomit-inducing hour - the passenger plane as i said no more poking at plot holes ill just leave it there passenger plane next the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie and what makes it everything it is - snakes yay! oh pause first we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have hot horny couple see if you can guess how they die dead-before-any-snakes-even-appear british guy those pesky brits eh cute kids and jo brand for all you americans thats an english comic famous for her size and unattractiveness now that weve met the cast lets watch all of them die except of course the cute kids dont expect anything original its just snake bites on various and ever-increasingly hilarious really not parts of the body use your imagination since the film-makers obviously didnt use theirsso thats most of the film wrapped up so now for the best bit the ending as expected everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face yep ice-cool sammy included but wait were not all off the plane yet! the last guy to get off is good guy but just as he does he gets bitten by a you guessed it snake of all things clearly this one had been hiding in mr jacksons hair the whole time since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier despite the 200ft constrictor the one that ate that pesky british bugger being unable to so sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop at this point i prayed that the movie was about to make a much-needed u-turn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort but no in a kind of icing on the cake way but with stale cheese remember it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest how anyone can think that an audience 10 years ago let alone in 2006 would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me but it did well in summing up the filmactually were not quite done yet after everyone has sucked face uncle sam with leading actress good guy with tiffany token black guy with token white girl and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia its time for good guy and hero to get it onin bali!!! nope it wasnt at all exciting the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll yes the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times thats it this is the first time ive ever posted a movie review but i felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography if you like planes snakes samuel ljackson air hostesses bad guys surfing dogs in bags or english people then please please dont see this movie it will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that youll never want to come into contact with any of them ever again go see united 93 instead that was good<SEP>0
this series has its ups and occasional downs and the latter is the case here theres an agreeable amount of spatter with an inventive implementation of the baby carts weapons but the editing film is a seriously disjointed the film-making itself rougher than usual at times the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the cub who nearly gets lost early on all in all disappointmentthat said theres a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers this installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him<SEP>0
todd rohal is a mad genius knuckleface jones his third and most fully realized short film has an offbeat sense of humor and will leave some scratching their heads what the film is about at heart and he would almost certainly disagree with me on this is how a regular joe finds the confidence to get through life with a little inspiration or not you just have to see for yourself the short is intermittently making rounds on the festival circuit so keep your eyes peeled and catch it if you can - youll be glad you did it is hilarious and check out todds other short films also popping up here and there from time to time: single spaced and slug 660<SEP>1
dont let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and watching this romy schneider classic this movie was shot in a lower budget probably against the will of ernest marishka so he had to make duefor example england is portrayed as bordering on germanyby a will of the wisp victoria and her mom are taking a vacation to germany by buggy ride alonethey arrived their too quick this probably could not be helped but the castle they rented for the movie was austrian when shes told that shes queen she goes to the royal room where the members of the court bow to her where are the british citizens out side from the castle cheering for their new queen why isbnt she showing her self up to the balcony to greet her subjects low budget!where the audience back then aware of these imperfection i wonder how the critics feltdurring the inn scene she meets prince albert but isbnt excited about it durring the meeting in the eating side of the inn your hear music from famous old american civil war songs like my old kentucky home and old black joe what civil war songs in the 1830s is romy schneider being portrayed as scarletwheres mammy is magna shnieder playing her too is adrian hoven rhett or ashley what was in marishka mindwell this add to the campits unintentionally satirizing queen victoriaa story this is the only reason you should collect it or see it 03 11 09 correction germany and england are connected<SEP>1
i went into deathtrap expecting a well orchestrated and intriguing thriller; and while thats something like what this film is; i also cant help but think that its just a poor mans sleuth the classic 1972 film is obviously an inspiration for this film; not particularly in terms of the plot but certainly its the case with the execution the casting of michael caine in the central role just confirms it the film is based on a play by ira levin who previously wrote rosemarys baby and the stepford wives and focuses on sidney bruhl; a playwright whose best days are behind him after his latest play bombs sidney finds himself at a low; and this is not helped when a play named deathtrap; written by an amateur he taught arrives on his doorstep deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success and sidney soon begins hatching a plot of his own; which involves inviting round the amateur scribe killing him and then passing deathtrap off as his own workdespite all of its clever twists and turns; deathtrap falls down on one primary element and thats the characters the film fails to provide a single likable character and its very hard to care about the story when youre not rooting for any of the players this is not helped by the acting michael caine puts in a good and entertaining performance as you would expect but nobody else does themselves proud christopher reeve is awkward in his role while dyan cannon somehow manages to make the only possibly likable character detestable with a frankly irritating performance its lucky then that the story is good; and it is just about good enough to save the film the plot features plenty of twists and turns; some work better than others but theres always enough going on to ensure that the film stays interesting director sidney lumet deserves some credit too as the style of the film is another huge plus the central location is interesting in its own right and the cinematography fits the film well overall i have to admit that i did enjoy this film; but it could have been much much better<SEP>1
spoilers!from the very moment i saw a local film critic trash this movie in a review on the 10:00 news i wanted to see it i dont remember who it was or which local omaha newscast carried the review but the critic was very insistent that this film was way too sleazy for the average church-going nebraskan they showed a snippet from the scene where john glover is about to kidnap ann-margret when shes swimming in the pool glovers character is commending her on how nice her body is and so forth using many words that the local station felt necessary to edit out i was hooked there was one problem though i was only 13 years old at the time and i had to wait a year until it came out on cable lets just say it was worth the wait!if ever there was a guilty pleasure of mine this movie is it to call this film sleazy would be a huge understatement the film centers around a successful businessman who is blackmailed by three small time scumbags after an affair with a young woman roy scheider who is as effective as ever plays the poor guy who just wanted a little fling and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrific villains john glovers character is one of the most memorable scumbags of all time hes sleazy funny at times and always on the brink of doing something crazy then theres robert trebors nice name by the way! character leo who is clearly in over his head with this blackmail scheme he is a whimpering sweating coward who runs a peep show place with live nude models then you have clarence williams iii as bobby shy a brooding sociopath who everyone is afraid of with good reason who could forget the wake-up call he gives vanity with the giant teddy bearafter dealing with the initial shock of realizing what hes up against scheider turns the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation that is until glover goes after his wife! the conflict is played out brutally with virtually the entire cast getting shot raped or blown up i dont know why i love this movie so much it really should creep me out but it doesnt maybe its because these characters are all interesting and the story takes plenty of chances that most films today would never try its scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters like glovers running around out in la looking for trouble just thinking about his voice is enough to make me chuckle hey sport have a nice day!this film has plenty of shootouts cool cars great dialog like the line in my opening statement and decent acting plenty of cameos by real life porno stars look for ron jeremy frolicking around in a hot tub with two chicks in a party scene at glovers place another thing i must add: how hot are the women in this film wow! travolta did right by marrying kelly preston yum! we also see vanity get nude in a time before she became a born again christian and ann-margret what else could you say about her except that she is the quintessential american beauty 9 of 10 starsso sayeth the houndadded feb 14 2008: rip roy scheider!<SEP>1
this film lacked something i couldnt put my finger on at first: charisma on the part of the leading actress this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play it could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors i just dont knowbut could it have been the screenplay just exactly who was the chef in love with he seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits than of anybody or anything else he never convinced me he was in love with the princessi was disappointed in this movie but dont forget it was nominated for an oscar so judge for yourself<SEP>0
ok so i dont watch too many horror movies - and the reason is films like dark remains i caught this on a surprisingly feature-filled dvd and it scared me silly in fact the only extra i think the dvd was missing was a pair of new pantshowever the next day i was telling someone about it when i realised id only really seen about 10% of it the rest of the time id been watching the pizza on my coffee table - nervous that my girlfriend would catch me if i actually covered my eyes the few times i did brave watching the screen i jumped so hard that i decided not to look up againthe film-making is solid and the characters situation was really compelling the simplicity of the film is what really captured my jump-button - its merely a woodland a cabin and a disused jail - and a lot of darkness most surprising to me was the fact that while this was clearly not a multi-million dollar production the make-up effects really looked like it was! also its obvious this is a film made by someone with a great love of film-making the sound design and the music really made use of my surround system like many hollywood movies have never done i noticed on-line that this film won the la shriekfest - a really major achievement and i guess that the festival had seen the filmmakers clear talent - and probably a great deal more of this movie than i managed toturn up the sound turn off the lights and if you want to keep your girlfriend - order a pizza<SEP>1
theres a lot the matter with helen and none of its good shelley winters and debbie reynolds play mothers of a pair of leopold & loeb like killers who move from the mid-west to hollywood to escape their past reynolds a starstruck jean harlow wannabe opens a dance studio for children and winters is her piano player soon winters as helen begins to crack up its all very slow going and although there are moments of real creepiness nasty phone calls a visit from wino timothy carey the movie is devoid of any real horror nevertheless its still worthy entertainment the acting divas are fine and the production values are terrific a music score by david raskin cinematography by lucien ballard and oscar-nominated costumes contribute mightily with this a place in the sun and lolita to her credit does anyone do crazy as well as winters directed by curtis harrington a master at this type of not quite a-movie exploitation in addition to carey the oddball supporting cast includes dennis weaver agnes moorehead as a very aimee semple mcpherson like evangelist yvette vickers and micheál macliammóir the irish orson welles as hamilton starr aptly nicknamed hammy<SEP>0
it seems a shame that greta garbo ended her illustrious career at the age of 36 with this ridiculous mistaken-identity marital romp coming off the success of her first romantic comedy ernst lubitschs masterful ninotchka 1939 where she was ideally cast as an austere russian envoy garbo is reunited with her leading man melvyn douglas for a sitcom-level story that has her playing karin borg a plain-jane ski instructor who impulsively marries publishing executive larry blake when he becomes smitten with her once he makes clear that work is his priority karin inadvertently decides to masquerade as her high-living twin sister katherine to test her husbands fidelity when he is back in manhattanits surprising that this infamous 1941 misfire was directed by george cukor who led garbo to her greatest dramatic performance in 1937s camille because this is as unflattering a vehicle as one could imagine for the screen legend only someone with carole lombards natural sense of ease and mischief could have gotten away with the shenanigans presented in the by-the-numbers script by sn behrman salka viertel and george oppenheimer mgms intent behind this comedy was to contemporize and americanize garbos image for wartime audiences whom the studio heads felt were not interested in the tragic period characters she favored in the thirtieshowever garbo appears ill-at-ease mostly as the bogus party girl katherine and especially compared to expert farceurs like douglas and constance bennett as romantic rival griselda photographed unflatteringly by joseph ruttenberg garbo looks tired in many scenes and downright hideous in her teased hairdo for the chica-choca dance sequence the story ends conventionally but with the addition of a lengthy physical sequence where larry tries to maneuver his skis on a series of mountain cliffs that unfortunately reminds me of sonny bonos death roland young and ruth gordon in a rare appearance at this point of her career show up in comic supporting roles as douglas associates this movie is not yet on dvd and i wouldnt consider it priority for transfer as it represents a curio in garbos otherwise legendary career she was reportedly quite unhappy during the filming i can see why<SEP>0
warning! dont even consider watching this film in any form its not even worth downloading from the internet every bit of porn has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid the so-called filmmakers apparently have absolutely no idea how to make a film they couldnt tell a good joke to save their lives its an insult to any human being if youre looking for a fun-filled movie - go look somewhere elselets hope this mr unterwaldt the jr being a good indication for his obvious inexperience and intellectual infancy dies a slowpainful death and never makes a film againin fact its even a waste of time to write anything about this crap thats why ill stop right now and rather watch a good film<SEP>0

when i first read the plot of this drama i assumed it was going to be like sex and the city however this drama is nothing like it the stories the characters seem more real and you empathise with the situations more the concept of the drama is similar four 30 something women guide us through there friendships and relationships with problems and strife along the way katie the gp is a dark and brooding character who you find difficult to relate too and is best friends with trudi a widow trudis character is heart warming as you can relate to difficulties she is having along with the fact she is the only mother of the four jessica is the party girl very single minded and knows what she wants and how to get it she is a likable character and is closest to siobhan the newly wed who whilst loving her husband completely cant help her eyes wandering to her work colleague over all the drama is surprisingly addictive and if the bbc continue to produce the series it could do well it is unlike other female cast dramas such as sex and the city or desperate housewives this if played right could be the next cold feet plus the male cast are not bad on the eyes too<SEP>1
go see this movie for the gorgeous imagery of andy goldsworthys sculptures and treat yourself to a thoroughly eye-opening and relaxing experience the music perfectly complements the footage but never draws attention towards itself some commentators called the interview snippets with the artist a weak spot but consider this: why would you expand on this in a movie if you can read andys musings at length in his books or attend one of his excellent lectures this medium is much more suitable to show the ephemeral nature of the artists works and is used expertly in this respect<SEP>1
i dont really post comments but wanted to make sure to warn people off this film its an unfinished student film with no redeeming features whatsoever on a technical level its completely amateur - constant unintentional jump edits within scenes dubbing wildly off etc the plot is completely clichéd the structure is laughable and the acting is embarrassing i dont want to be too harsh: ive made my share of student films and they were all awful but theres no reason for this film to be out in the world where innocent fans will have to see itsafe assumption that - much like the cast - positive comments are filmmakers friends and family<SEP>0
tiempo de valientes fits snugly into the buddy action movie genre but transcends its roots thanks to excellent casting tremendous rapport between its leads and outstanding photography diego peretti stars as dr silverstein a shrink assigned to ride shotgun with detective diaz luis luque whos been assigned to investigate the murder of two minor hoods who seem to have been involved in am arms smuggling conspiracy diaz has been suspended from duty but hes the best man for the job and must have professional psychiatric help in order to be reinstated silverstein and diaz soon find themselves enmeshed in a conspiracy involving argentinas intelligence community and some uranium and the film separates them at a crucial point that allows silverstein to develop some impressive sleuthing skills of his own peretti and luque are excellent together and remind me of screen team terence hill and bud spencer though peretti isnt as classically handsome as hill remarkably even at almost two hours in length tiempo de valientes doesnt wear out its welcome and indeed writer-director damian szifron sets up a potential sequel in the films charming coda all in all a wonderful and very entertaining action comedy that neither panders to the lowest common denominator nor insults your intelligence<SEP>1

in the film brokedown palace directed by jonathan kaplan two best friends alice claire danes and darlene kate beckinsale decide to celebrate high school graduation by taking a trip to hawaii but hear that bangkok thailand is much more fun they switched plans and decided to go to thailand without telling their parents the change of plans while they were in thailand alice and darlene met a really handsome guy named nick parks daniel lapaine he tells them that he would trade in his first class ticket to hong kong for three economy tickets so that they could spend the weekend in hong kong they accepted his offer and upon entering the airport the two were arrested for smuggling drugs they were convicted and sentenced to thirty three years in prison i think kaplan was trying to show the audience that it is wise to make good decisions because in one instance one bad decision can change the direction of a life forever also a friendly face may not be as friendly as we think once we find out the real intentions of that friendly face those girls made a decision not to tell their parents that they had switched their plans and it changed their lives forever things have a funny way of happening showing us what decision we have made verses the decision that we should have made sometimes life is not fair that is why it is important to think long and hard about the choices that we make because we can never go back and change the choices that we have madethis movie has a great setting; it was filmed mostly in bangkok thailand this film also has great music; a few of my favorite songs are silence by delerium damaged by plumb deliver me by sarah bightman and partys just begun by nelly furtado i went out and bought the soundtrack after watching this film these girls where young and naive and failed to think their plans out thoroughly a mistake that anyone could make therefore this film is good for any audience it makes no difference young or old -- we all are human and subject to mistakes even though i did not like the way this film ended leaving me in question of --who really smuggled the drugs -- i would definitely give this film two thumbs up<SEP>1
i think the majority of the people seem not the get the right idea about the movie at least thats my opinion i am not sure its a movie about drug abuse; rather its a movie about the way of thinking of those genius brothers drugs are side effects something marginal again its not a commercial movie that you see every day and if the author wanted that he definitely failed as most people think its one of the many drug related movies i however think something else is the case as in many movies portraying different cultures audience usually fully understands movies portraying their own culture ie something theyve grown up with and are quite familiar with this movie is to show what those genius people very often think and what problems they face the reason why they act like this is because they are bored out of their minds : they have to meet people who do mediocre things and accept those things as if they are launching space shuttles on daily basis they start a fairly hard job and excel in no time they feel like- i went to work did nothing still did twice as better as the guys around me when they were all over their projects what should i do now with my free time and whats even more boring when you can start predicting behavior not because youre psychologist but instead because you have seen this pattern in the past so for them from one side its a non challenging job which is also fairly boring sometimes and from another they start to figure out peoples behavior its a recipe for big big boredom and the dumbest things are usually done to get out of this state they guy earlier who mentioned that their biggest problem is that they are trying to figure out life in terms of logic math describes logic while life is not really a logical thing is actually absolutely right<SEP>1
wow saw this last night and im still reeling from how good it was every character felt so real although most of them petty selfish a**holes and the bizarre story - middle aged widow starts shagging her daughters feckless boyfriend - felt utterly convincing top performances all round but hats off to anne reid and our friends in the norths daniel craig the latter coming across as the next david thewlisand director roger michell this is as far from notting hill as its possible to be thank godwatch this movie!!!<SEP>1
the plot is tight the acting is flawless the directing script scenery casting are all well done i watch this movie frequently though i dont know what it is about the whole thing that grabs me see it and drop me a line if you can figure out why i like it so much<SEP>1
first saw this half a lifetime ago on a black-and-white tv in a small samoan village and thought it was hilarious now having seen it for the second time so much later i dont find it hilarious i dont find anything hilarious anymore but this is a witty and light-hearted comedy that moves along quickly without stumbling and i thoroughly enjoyed itits 1945 and fred macmurray is a 4f whos dying to get into one of the armed forces he rubs a lamp in the scrapyard hes managing and a genie appears to grant him a few wishes ho hum right but though the introduction is no more than okay the fantasies are pretty lively macmurray tells the genie that he wants to be in the army poof and he is marching along with washingtons soldiers into a particularly warm and inviting uso where june haver and joan leslie are wearing lots of lace doilies or whatever they are and lavender wigs washington sends macmurray to spy on the enemy -- red-coating german-speaking hessians not brits the hessians are jammed into a bierstube and singing a very amusing drinking song extolling the virtues of the vaterland where the white wine is winier and the rhine waters rhinier and the bratwurst is mellower and the yellow hair is yellower and the frauleins are jucier and the goose steps are goosier something like that the characterizations are fabulous as good as sig rumanns best otto preminger is the suspicious and sinister hessian general you know heidelberg vee are 241 to 1 against you -- but vee are not afraid i cant go on too long with these fantasies but theyre all quite funny and so are the lyrics when he wishes he were in the navy macmurray winds up with columbus and the fantasy is presented as grand opera dont you know that sailing west meant a terrifically expensive investment and who do you suppose provides the means but isabella queen of queens when they sight the new world someone remarks that it looks great i dont care what it looks like mutters columbus but that place is going to be called columbuslandanyway everything is finally straightened out though the genie by this time is quite drunk and macmurray winds up in the marine corps with the right girlive made it sound too cute maybe but it is cute the kids will enjoy the puffs of smoke and the magic and the corny love story the adults will get a kick out of the more challenging elements of the story who are the hessians unless they happen to be college graduates in which case they might want to stick with the legerdemain and say wow! awesome!<SEP>1
this is in my opinion much better than either of the 2 1990s versions but is still not all that good it feels dated probably because it is but it does stand up well compared to other bbc 1980s period pieces such as mansfield park and northanger abbeythe length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the 2 90s versions and st john rivers is at least covered although not very well timothy dalton is very good as rochester but the actress playing jane is much too old there is definitely scope for a tv adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it<SEP>1
the broadway musical a chorus line is arguably the best musical in theatre its about the experiences of people who live for dance; the joys they experience and the sacrifices they make each dancer is auditioning for parts in a broadway chorus line yet what comes out of each of them are stories of how their lives led them find dance as a respite the film version though captures none of the passion or beauty of the stage show and is arguably the worst film adaptation of a broadway musical as it is lifeless and devoid of any affection for dance whatsoever the biggest mistake was made in giving the directors job to sir richard attenborough whose direction offered just the right touch and pacing for gandhi why would anyone in his or her right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a fairly constricted placewhich brings us to the next problem a chorus line takes place on stage in a theatre with no real sets and limited costume changes its the least flashy of broadway musicals and its simplicity was its glory however that doesnt translate well to film and no one really thought that it would for that reason the movie should have taken us in the lives of these dancers and should have left the theatre and audition process the singers could have offered their songs in other environments and even have offered flashbacks to their first ballet jazz or tap class heck they could have danced down broadway in their lively imaginations yet not one shred of imagination went into the making of this film as attenboroughs complete indifference for dance and the show itself is evident in his lackadaisical directionmany scenes are downright awkward as the dancers tell their story to the director michael douglas whether he wants to hear them or not douglas character is capricious about choosing to whom he extends a sympathetic ear and to whom he has no patience while the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play some heretical changes were made the very beautiful hello twelve hello thirteen hello love--a smashing stage number which took the dancers back to their adolescence--was removed and replaced with the dreadful surprise a song so bad that it was nominated for an oscar adding insult to injury surprise simply retold the same story as hello love but without the wit or pathosthere is no reason to see this film unless you want a lesson in what not to do when transferring a broadway show to film if you want to see a film version of this show the next closest thing is bob fosses brilliant all that jazz while fosses daughter is in a chorus line he is the fosse who should have been involved as director he would have known what to do with this material which deserved far greater respect than this sad effort<SEP>0
the minute i started watching this i realised that i was watching a quality production so i was not surprised to find that the screenplay was written by andrew davis and was produced by sue birtwhistle both of these brought us the excellent 1995 production of pride and prejudice! so my only gripe here is that emma did not run to 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like pride and prejudice the acting was superb with i think prunella scales excellent as miss bates but i loved kate beckinsale and mark strong just as much the language is a delight to listen to can you imagine in this day and age having a right go at someone without actually uttering a swear word samantha morton was excellent as miss smith in fact the casting was spot on much as it was with pride and prejudice i liked it so much that i watched it twice in two days!! so once again thank you bbc for another quality piece of television i have seen the paltrow version and it is okay but i do think the bbc version is far superior an excellent production that i am very happy to own on dvd!!!<SEP>1
the movie remains in the gray for far too long very little gets explained as the movie progresses with as a result lots of weird sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning but because of the way of storytelling they become only just weird and not understandable to watch it sort of forces you to watch the movie again but no way im going to do that it is that i watched this movie in the morning im sure of it that if i watched this movie in the evening i would had fallen asleep to me the movie was like a poor mans blade runnerthe movie leaves far too many questions and improbabilities it makes the movie leave a pointless and non-lasting impressionalso the weird look of the movie doesnt help much the movie is halve cgihalve real life but its not done halve as good impressive spectacular and imaginative as for instance would be the case in later movies such as sin city and 300 they even created halve of the characters of the movie by computer which seemed like a very pointless- and odd choice also considering that the character animation isnt too impressive looking sure the futuristic environment is still good looking and the movie obviously wasnt cheap to make but its style over substance and in this case that really isnt a positive thing to saysome of the lines are also absolutely horrendous and uninteresting the main god of the movie constantly says lines such as; im going to do this but its none of your concern why i want to do it than just dont say anything at all mr horus! its irritating and a really easy thing to put in movie if you dont care to explain anything about the plot also the deeper questions and meanings of the movie gets muddled in the drivel of the movie and its scriptthe actors still did their very best they seemed like they believed in the project and were sure of it that what they were making would be something special so i cant say anything negative about themthe story and movie is far from original it rip-offs from a lot of classic and semi-classic mostly modern science-fiction movies it perhaps is also the reason why the movie made a very redundant impression on mea failed and uninteresting movie experiment310<SEP>0
this inept adaptation of arguably one of martin amiss weaker novels fails to even draw comparisons with other druggy oeuvres such as requiem for a dream or anything penned by irvine walsh as it struggles to decide whether it is a slap-stick cartoon or a hyper-realistic hallucinationboringly directed by william marsh in over-saturated hues a group of public school drop-outs converge in a mansion awaiting the appearance of three american friends for a weekend of decadent drug-taking and thats it except for the ludicrous sub-plot soon-to-be-the-main-plot nonsense about an extremist cult group who express themselves with the violent killings of the worlds elite figures be it political or pampered within the first reel you know exactly where this is goingwhat is a talented actor like paul bettany doing in this tiresome badly written bore made prior to his rise to fame and jennifer connelly one can be assured that had he been offered this garbage now hed have immediately changed agents! avoid<SEP>0
like all the taviani brothers films this one looks great but it is rotten to the core with false romanticism and coincidences heap upon each other in some facsimile of a story in actuality this is really just a sentimentally cheap tear jerker posing as an intellectually distinguished art film<SEP>0
although i am generally a proponent of the well-made film i do not limit myself to films which escape those boundaries and more often than not i do enjoy and admire films that successfully break the rules and it is quite true that director pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema but it is also my opinion that he does not break them successfully or to any actual pointpasolinis work is visually jarring but this is less a matter of what is actually on the screen than how it is filmed and the jumpiness of his films seem less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography this is true of decameron pasolini often preferred to use non-actors and while many directors have done so with remarkable result under pasolinis direction his non-actors tend to remain non-actors this is also true of decameron pasolini quite often includes images designed to shock offend or otherwise disconcert the audience such elements can often be used with startling effect but in pasolinis hands such elements seldom seem to actually contribute anything to the film this is also true of decameroni have been given to understand there are many people who like even admire pasolinis films even so i have never actually met any of them and i have never been able to read anything about pasolini or his works that made the reason for such liking or admiration comprehensible to me judging him from his works alone i am of the opinion that he was essentially an amateurish director who did not break the rules so much by choice as by lack of skill--and who was initially applauded by the intelligentsia of his day for existential boldness thereby simply confirming him in bad habits as a film maker i find his work tedious unimpressive and pretentious and this too is true of decameron it is also sadly true of virtually every pasolini film it has been my misfortune to endure<SEP>0
the pioneering technicolor cinematography winner of special technical achievement oscar is indeed enchanting add an endless variety of glamorous costumes and a romantic cinema dream team like marlene dietrich and charles boyer and youve got a rather pleasant pictureunfortunately the contrived plot as well as the over-blown acting leave much to be desired still there have not been any more breathtaking technicolor films before this one 1936 and very few since then that can top this breathtaking visual experience of stunning colors cinema fans who have enjoyed the glorious color cinematography in robin hood 1938 jesse james 1939 and gone with the wind 1939 will not be disappointed in the fantastic work done here the garden of allah will always be synonymous with brilliant color cinematography<SEP>1
if theres one genre that ive never been a fan of its the biopic always misleading filled with false information over-dramatized scenes and trickery all around biopics are almost never done right even in the hands of the truly talented directors like martin scorsese the aviator and ron howard a beautiful mind they often do a great disservice to the people they are trying to capture on screen skeptiscism takes the place of hype with the majority of biopics that make their way to the big screen and the notorious bettie page was no different some critics and moviegoers objected to gretchen mol given the role of bettie page saying she was no longer a celebrity and didnt have the chops for the part i never doubted mol could handle the part since but i never expected to as blown as away by her performance as i was upon just viewing the film hours ago mol delivers a knockout oscar worthy performance as the iconic 1950s pin-up girl who after an early life of abuse depicted subtlety and tastefully done something few directors would probably do inadvertently becomes one of the most talked about models of all time the picture covers a lot of ground in its 90 minute running time yet despite no less than three subplots there is still a feeling that there may be a small portion missing from the story directorco-writer marry harron and guinevere turners fantastic script is only marred by a too abrupt and not as clear as it should be ending still credit must be given to the two ladies for creating a nearly flawless biopic that manages to pay tribute to both its subject and the decade it emulates masterfully come oscar time mol turner and harron should be receiving nominations doubt it will happen though there certainly are no three women more deserving of them 910<SEP>1
maybe its the dubbing or maybe its the endless scenes of people crying moaning or otherwise carrying on but i found europa 51 to be one of the most overwrought and therefore annoying films ive ever seen the film starts out promisingly if familiarly as mom ingrid bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled brat of a son sandro franchina whilst mummy and daddy bland alexander knox entertain their guests at a dinner party the youngster tries to kill himself setting in motion a life changing series of events that find bergman spending time showering compassion on the poor and needy spurred on by communist newspaper editor andrea ettore giannini she soon spends more time with the downtrodden than she does with her husband who soon locks her up in an insane asylum for her troubles bergman plays the saint role to the hilt echoing her 1948 role as joan of arc and rossellini does a fantastic job of lighting and filming her to best effect unfortunately the script pounds its point home with ham-fisted subtlety as andrea and mom take turns declaiming marxist and christian platitudes by the final tear soaked scene i had had more than my fill of these tiresome characters a real step down for rossellini as he stepped away from neo-realism and further embraced the mythical and mystical themes of 1950s flowers of st francis<SEP>0

zu:the warriors from magic mountain was and is an impressive classic! you never would have guessed it was made in 1983 tsui harks use of special effects was very creative and inventive he continued doing this in the chinese ghost story trilogy and later productions even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre legend of zu is connected to zuwarriors from magic mountain! it is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one the plot is a bit hard to follow but to be honest it doesnt matter it is all about the action and adventure! i always was wondering what tsui hark would do if he got his hands on cgi now we knowhe made this movie maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that i am not going to be critical about that there is so much happening on the screenyou simply wont believe! i think it is a big shame that this movie wasnt shown in theaters here in holland because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas! this movie easily can beat big budget hollywood productions like superman returns or xmen 3 the only thing i do have to mention is the lack of humor! in most of tsui harkss movies he combines dramafantasymartial arts and humor somehow it is missing in this movie again i am not going to be picky about these small matters legend of zu delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see a true classic!<SEP>1
i wouldnt bring a child under 8 to see this with puppies dangling off of buildings squirming through dangerous machines and listening to cruellas scary laugh to name a few of the events there is entirely too much suspense for a small child the live action gives a more ominous feel than the cartoon version and there are quite a few disquieting moments including some guy that seems to be a transvestite a lot of tense moments that will worry and may frighten small kidsi dont know what the disney folks were thinking but neither the story nor the acting were of their usual level the puppies are cute but this movie is spotty at best<SEP>0
after a long hard week behind the desk making all those dam serious decisions this movie is a great way to relax like wells and the original radio broadcast this movie will take you away to a land of alien humor and sci-fi paraday captain zippo died in the great charge of the buick he was a brave man the jack nicholson impressions shine right through that alien face with the dark sun glasses and leather jacket and always remember to beware of the doughnut of death! keep in mind the number one rule of this movie - suspension of disbelief - sit back and relax - and prepare to die earth scum! you just have to see it for yourself<SEP>1
the wicker man i am so angry that i cannot write a proper comment about this moviethe plot was ridiculous thinly tied together and altogether-just lame nicolas cageshame on you! i assumed that since you were in it that it would be at least decent it was noti felt like huge parts of the movie had been left on the cutting room floor and even if its complete-the movie was just outlandish and sillyat the end youre left mouth agape mind befuddled and good taste offended i have never heard so many people leave a theater on opening day with so much hatred people were complaining about it in small groups in the mall four floors down from the theater near the entrance its that badi heard it compared to : glitter american werewolf in paris and gigli my boyfriend was so mad he wouldnt even talk about itgrrrr!<SEP>0
after watching two of his silent shorts elena and her men 1956 is my first feature-length film from french director jean renoir and i quite enjoyed it however i didnt watch the film for renoir but for star ingrid bergman who  at age 41  still radiated unsurpassed beauty elegance and charm throughout the early 1950s following her scandalous marriage to italian roberto rossellini bergman temporarily fell out of public favour her next five films directed by her husband were unsuccessful in the united states and i suspect that renoirs latest release did little to enhance bergmans popularity with english-speaking audiences {however she did regain her former success with an oscar in the same years anastasia 1956} she stars as elena sokorowska a polish princess who sees herself as a guardian angel of sorts bringing success and recognition to promising men everywhere before promptly abandoning them while working her lucky charms to aid the political aspirations of the distinguished general francois rollan jean marais she finds herself falling into a love that she wont be able to walk away from this vaguely-political film works well as either a satire or a romantic comedy as long as you dont take it too seriously; its purely lighthearted romantic flufffilmed in vibrant technicolor elena and her men looks terrific as well a flurry of bright colours characters and costumes bergmans polish princess is dreamy and somewhat self-absorbed not in an unlikable way but hardly a woman of high principles and convictions she is persuaded by a team of bumbling government conspirators to convince general rollan to stage a coup détat knowingly exploiting his love for her in order to satisfy her own delusions as a guardian angel perhaps the films only legitimately virtuous character is henri de chevincourt mel ferrer then audrey hepburns husband who ignores everybody elses selfish secondary motives and pursues elena for love and love alone this renoir proudly suggests is what the true french do best elena and her men also attempts with moderate success to expose the superficiality of upper-class french liaisons through the clumsy philandering of eugène jacques jouanneau who cant make love to his servant mistress without his fiancè walking in on them for these sequences renoir was obviously trying for the madcap sort of humour that you might find in a marx brothers film but the film itself is so relaxed and laid-back that the energy just isnt there<SEP>1
i caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel and was reminded of how terrible i thought it was in 1980 when first released many reviewers out there arent old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between stanley kubrick and steven king the enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed master director put this multi-layered supernatural story on the screen salems lot had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a tv mini-series directed by tobe hooper he of texas chainsaw massacre fame and was badly handled turning the major villain of the book into a chiller theatre vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise fans hoped that a director of kubricks stature would succeed where hooper had failed it didnt happensure this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments its all downhill jack nicholson cannot be anything but jack nicholson hes always crazy and didnt bring anything to his role here i dont care that many reviewers here think hes all that in this clinker the heres johnny! bit notwithstandinghes just awful in this movie so is everyone else for that matter scatman crothers character dick halloran was essential to the plot of the book yet kubrick kills him off in one of the lamest shock sequences ever put on film i remember the audience in the theater i saw this at booing repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick those that stayed that ismany left kings books really never translate well to film since so much of the narratives occur internally to his characters and often metaphysically kubrick jettisoned the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately dont really care what happens to whomthis movie still stinks and why so many think its a horror masterpiece is beyond me<SEP>0
a movie of outstanding brilliance and a poignant and unusual love story the luzhin defence charts the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty depth and character it gives john turturro what is probably his finest role to date thank goodness they didnt give it to ralph fiennes who would have murdered it similarly emily watson shows the wealth of her experience from her outstanding background on the stage to reach the tortured chess master turturro her character has to display intelligence as well as a womans love watson does not portray beauty-pageant sexuality but she brings to her parts a self-awareness that is alluring in a chance meeting between natalia watson and luzhin she casually stops him from losing a chess piece that has fallen through a hole in his clothing - a specially crafted piece that we realize later in the film has come to symbolize his hopes and aspirations later as their love affair develops she subtly likens dancing to chess luzhin has learnt to dance but never with a partner; she encourages him to lead her with bold brilliant moves and in doing so enables him to relax sufficiently to later play at his best and also realize himself as her lover this is a story of a woman who inspires a man to his greatest achievement and in so doing finds her own deepest fulfillment emotionally and intellectually or so we are led to believe - certainly within the time frame natalia is something of a liberated woman rather than someone who grooms herself to be a stereotypical wife and mother the italian sets are stunning the complexity of the characters and the skill with which the dialogue unfolds them is a delight to the intelligent movie-goer yet the film is accessible enough to make it a popular mainstream hit and most deservedly so chess is merely the photogenic backdrop for developing an emotional and emotive movie although the game is treated with enough respect to almost convince a chess-player that the characters existed although a tragedy of remarkable heights by a classic author the final denouement is nevertheless surprisingly uplifting<SEP>1

scoop is also the name of a late-thirties evelyn waugh novel and woody allens new movie though set today has a nostalgic charm and simplicity it hasnt the depth of characterization intense performances suspense or shocking final frisson of allens penultimate effort match point argued by many including this reviewer to be a strong return to form but scoop does closely resemble allens last outing in its focus on english aristocrats posh london flats murder and detection this time woody leaves behind the arriviste murder mystery genre and returns to comedy and is himself back on the screen as an amiable vaudevillian a magician called sid waterman stage moniker the great splendini who counters some snobs probing with i used to be of the hebrew persuasion but as i got older i converted to narcissism following a revelation in the midst of splendinis standard dematerializing act with scarlett johansson as sondra pransky the audience volunteer the mismatched pair get drawn into a dead ace english journalists post-mortem attempt to score one last top news story on the edge of the styx joe strombel ian mcshane has just met the shade of one lord lymans sons secretary who says she was poisoned and shes told him the charming aristocratic bounder son peter lyman hugh jackman was the tarot card murderer a london serial killer sondra and sid immediately become a pair of amateur sleuths with sids deadpan wit and sondras bumptious beauty they cut a quick swath through to the cream of the london aristocracywoody isnt pawing his young heroine muse -- as in match point johansson again -- as in the past this time moreover scarletts not an ambitious sexpot and would-be movie star shes morphed surprisingly into a klutzy bespectacled but still pretty coed sid and sondra have no flirtation which is a great relief they simply team up more or less politely to carry out strombels wishes by befriending lyman and watching him for clues to his guilt with only minimal protests sid consents to appear as sondras dad sondra whos captivated peter by pretending to drown in his club pool re-christens herself jade spence mr spence ie woody keeps breaking cover by doing card tricks but he amuses dowagers with these and beats their husbands at poker spewing non-stop one-liners and all the while maintaining apparently with success that hes in oil and precious metals just as jade has told him to saythats about all there is to it or all that can be told without spoiling the story by revealing its outcome at first allens decision to make johansson a gauche naively plainspoken and badly dressed college girl seems not just unkind but an all-around bad decision but johansson who has pluck and panache as an actress miraculously manages to carry it off helped by jackman an actor who knows how to make any actress appear desirable if he desires her the film actually creates a sense of relationships to make up for it limited range of characters: sid and sondra spar in a friendly way and peter and sondra have a believable attraction even though its artificial and tainted she is after all going to bed with a suspected homicidal maniacwhat palls a bit is allens again drooling over english wealth and class things his brooklyn background seems to have left him despite all his celebrity with a irresistible hankering for jackman is an impressive fellow glamorous and dashing his parents were english but could this athletic musical comedy star raised in australia x-mans wolverine really pass as an aristocrat only in the movies perhaps here and in kate and leopoldthis isnt as strong a film as match point but to say its a loser as some viewers have is quite wrong it has no more depth than a half-hour radio drama or a tv show but woodys jokes are far funnier and more original than youll get in any such media affair and sometimes they show a return to the old wit and cleverness it doesnt matter if a movie is silly or slapdash when its diverting summer entertainment on a hot day you dont want a heavy meal the whole thing deliciously evokes a time when movie comedies were really light escapist entertainment without crude jokes or bombastic effects; without vince vaughan or owen wilson critics are eager to tell you this is a return to the allen decline that preceded match point dont believe them he doesnt try too hard why should he he may be 70 but verbally hes still light on his feet and his body moves pretty fast too<SEP>1
the decoy is one of those independent productions made by obvious newcomers but it doesnt have all the usual flaws that sink most such films it has a definite story it has adequate acting the photography is very good the hero and the bad guy are both formidable men and the background music isnt overdone this is a dvd new release so people will be looking here to see if its worthwhile i dont know where all the 10s come from as theres no way this film is that good --- even if youre the filmmakers mother the last film we saw at a theater was warners trashing of j k rawlings much-loved and excellent book order of the phoenix in comparing the decoy with phoenix consider that phoenix as made by warners had no story certainly no acting was allowed by the director the photography was dreadful and the wall-of-sound overbearing musical score was just a mess i rated phoenix a 1 because the scale doesnt go any lower the decoy is 4 times better -- in all regardsif you have the opportunity give the decoy a chance remember this isnt decoy 3 -- the shootout or any such nonsense its original if your expectations arent overblown by the foolish 10 scores here you might just enjoy the film on its own terms<SEP>0
i had watched snippets from this as a kid but while i purchased blue undergrounds set immediately due to its being a limited edition only now did i fit it in my viewing schedule - and thats mainly because bakshis american pop 1981 just turned up on late-night italian tv see my review of that film below! anyway i found the film to be a quite good sword-and-sorcery animated epic with especially impressive-looking backdrops the rather awkward rotoscoped characters were admittedly less so with a rousing if derivative score the plot again wasnt exactly original but proved undeniably engaging on a juvenile level and the leading characters well enough developed - especially interesting is the villainous ice-lord nekron and the enigmatic warrior darkwolf; the hero and heroine however are rather bland stereotypes - but one can hardly complain when bakshi and frazetta depict the girl as well-endowed her bra could be torn off any second and half-naked to boot her tiny panties are forever disappearing up her ass! still its clearly an action-oriented piece and it certainly delivers on this front that involving darkwolf being particularly savage; the final showdown though brief is also nicely handled and sees our heroes astride pterodactyls assaulting the villains lair inside a cave in the long run apart from the afore-mentioned frazetta backdrops the main appeal of this movie for me now is its nostalgia factor as it transported me back to my childhood days of watching not just films like conan the barbarian 1982 and the beastmaster 1982 but also animated tv series such as blackstar 1981-82 and he-man and the masters of the universe 1983-85as for the accompanying the making of fire and ice tv mark bakshi 1982 **12:vintage featurette on the sword-and-sorcery animated film which is only available via the washed-out vhs print owned by ralph bakshi himself! it goes into some detail about the rotoscope technique and also shows several instances of live-action performances in a studio of segments from the script - which would then be traced blended in with the backgrounds and filmed still having watched several such behind-the-scenes featurettes on the art of animation on the disney tins and the looney tunes sets for instance its doesnt make for a very compelling piece<SEP>1
since crouching tiger hidden dragon came along theres been a lot of talk about a revival of the hong kong movie industry dont believe it the people now making movies in hk give new meaning to the word crass running out of time 2 is a perfect example ekin cheng is the name draw here but he spends most of the film just grinning idiotically and flipping a coin he flips the coin over and over and again and again why who knows sean lau plays a cop who chases after the coin-flipping pretty boy but once again: who knows why theres a pretty actress in the female lead who runs some sort of company and she has to pay a ransom or something but she mostly just looks like she would rather be at a spa or shopping centre than in front of a camera nothing makes any sense there is no action there is no sex there is no comedy all there is is a name: ekin cheng and you know what who cares<SEP>0
i have seen this movie plenty of times and i gotta tell ya ive enjoyed it every single time this is belushis pinnacle movie in my opinion belushi and lovitz are so likable and identifiable with the common man that you cant help but get involved once you start watching the movie has a wonderful cast of stars some already were big and others were just getting started its billed as a feel good movie and thats exactly what it is this movie teaches you that life isnt always so bad after all sometimes youve just gotta look at stuff in a different perspective to fully appreciate what you already have when youre done watching youll appreciate the things you have a lot more and youll also be smiling you cant ask for much more from a movie in my opinion not to mention its a hilarious movie and youll never lose interest very very underrated movie here folksrating from me: 10 i am out!!!<SEP>1

jay chou plays an orphan raised in a kung fu school but kicked out by the corrupt headmaster after fighting with a bunch of thugs in the employ of a nefarious villain he happens upon down-on-his-luck trickster eric tsang who immediately sees cash potential in the youngsters skills basketball is the chosen avenue for riches and tsang bids to get him a spot on a university team and to promote him in the media general success leads to a basketball championship and a really nasty rival team managed by the same nefarious villain of beforeits all a bit shaolin soccer i guess but not so quirky or ridiculous - the plot sticks pretty close to sports movie conventions and delivers all the elements the crowd expects from the set-up youve seen it all before but its the kind of stuff it never hurts to see again when its done well luckily it really is done well here some might say surprisingly with chu yen-ping in the directors chair i expect he had good assistants - the script delivers and the presentation is slick and stylish jay chou remains pretty much expressionless throughout but such is his style and when he does let an emotion flicker across it can be to quite good comic effect eric tsang compensates with a larger-than-life character that hes played many times before in real life for instance who gets many of the films most emotional momentssince the film revolves around basketball its good that the scenes of basketball matches are suitably rousing the cast show some real skill including chou and some well done wirework and cgi add that element of hyper-real kung fu skill that make the scenes even more entertaining assuming you like that sort of thing and justify the movies plotexistencetheres only one significant fight scene in the movie but its a doozy in the one against many style jay chou appears to do a lot of his own moves and is quite impressive - hes clearly pretty strong and fast for real and ching siu-tungs choreography makes him look like a real martial artist i wish thered been more but at least its a lengthy fightvery much the kind of chinese new year blockbuster i hoped it would be from the trailer and recommended viewing!<SEP>1
this is one powerful film the first time i saw it the scottish accents made it tough for me to understand a lot and that ruined the viewing experience i gave up on it but then acquired the dvd used the english subtitles when i needed them and really got into this movie discovering just how good it is it is excellentthe widescreen picture makes it spectacular in parts with some wonderful rugged scenery and the story reminded me of braveheart an involving tale of good versus evil here its liam neeson good vs tim roth evil both do their jobs wellfew actors come across as despicable as roth man you really want to smack this guy in his arrogant irritating puss he is so nasty and vile the sick critics love his character more than anyone elses here neeson is a mans man and a solid hero figure as gibson was in braveheart jessica lange is strong in here as the female lead the movie draws you in and gets you totally involved so prepared to have an emotional experience viewing this<SEP>1
actually this is a lie shrek 3-d was actually the first 3d animated movie i bought it on dvd about 3 years ago didnt bugs life also do that i think it was at disneyworld in that tree so im saying before they go and use that as there logo also shrek 3d was a motion simulator at universal studios they should still consider it as a movie because it appeared in a theater and you could buy it for dvd the movie was cute at least the little flyes were i liked iq i agree with animaster they did a god job out of making a movie out of something that is just a out-and-back adventure i recommend it to families and kids<SEP>0
the secret of kells may be the most exquisite film i have seen since the triplets of belleville although stylistically very different kells shares with triplets and the jaw-dropping opening 2d sequence of kung fu panda incredible art direction production design backgroundlayout and a richness in color that is a feast for ones senses kells is so lavish -- almost gothic in its layout somewhat reminiscent of klimt wonderfully flat in general overall perspective ornate in its celtic & illuminated design yet the characters are so simplistic and appealing -- and it all works together beautifully you fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them you are so drawn to every detail of the story and to every stroke of the pencil & brush what tomm nora ross paul and all at cartoon saloon & their extended crews have achieved with this small budgetvery small crewed film is absolutely astounding the groundswell of support amongst our animation community is phenomenal this film is breathtaking and the buzz amongst our colleagues in recommending this film is spreading like wildfire congratulations to kells on its many accolades its annie nomination as well as its current oscar qualifying run they are all very well-deserved nods indeed<SEP>1
there is no reason to see this movie a good plot idea is handled very badly in the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense the reason for the killings are not made clear the acting is awful nick stahl obviously needs a better director he was excellent in in the bedroom but here he is terrible amber benson from buffy has to change her character someday even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed even though the movie was 80 minutes which is too short for a good movie but too long for this onethere are no deleted scenes in the dvd which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts to the charactersdont spend the time on this one<SEP>0
essentially a story of man versus nature this film has beautiful cinematography the lush jungles of ceylon and the presence of elizabeth taylor but the film really never gets going newlwed taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and later is drawn to the plantations foreman played by dana andrews the plantation is under the spell of owner peter finchs late father whose ghost casts a pall over elephant walk that becomes a major point of contention between taylor and finch the elephants are determined to reclaim their traditional path to water that was blocked when the mansion was built across their right-of-way the beasts go on a rampage and provides the best moments of action in the picture taylor and andrews have some good moments as she struggles to remain a faithful wife in spite of he marital difficulties with finch<SEP>0
if youre a fan of film noir and think they dont make em like they used to here is your answer -they just dont make em in hollywood anymore we must turn to the french to remember how satisfying subtle and terrific a well-made film from that genre can be read my lips is a wonderfully nasty little gift to the faithful from director jacques audiard featuring sharp storytelling and fine performances from emmanuelle devos and vincent casselthe basic plot could have been written in the 40s: dumb but appealing ex-con and a smart but dowdy femme fatale who turns out to be ruthlessly ambitious discover each other while living lives of bleak desperation and longing manipulate each other to meet their own ends develop complex lovehate relationship cook up criminal scheme involving heist double crosses close calls and lots of money all action takes place in depressing seedy andor poorly lit locations audiard has fashioned some modern twists of course the femme fatale is an underappreciated office worker who happens to be nearly deaf and uses her lip reading ability to take revenge on those who marginalize her and where you might expect steamy love scenes you discover that both characters are sexually awkward and immature add in a bit of modern technology and music and it seems like a contemporary film but make no mistake - this is old school film noir its as good as any film from the genre and easily one of the best films ive seen all year<SEP>1

having just seen the a perfect spy mini series in one go one can do nothing but doff ones hat - a pure masterpiece which compared to the other le carré minis about smiley has quite different qualitiesin the minis about smiley it is alex guiness as smiley who steals the show - the rest of the actors just support him one can sayhere it is ensemble and story thats important as the lead actor played excellently by peter egan in the final episodes isnt charismatic at all egan just plays a guy called magnus pym who by lying being devious and telling people what they like to hear is very well liked by everyone big and small the only one who seems to understand his inner self is alex his czech handlernever have the machinery behind a spy andor traitor been told better! after having followed his life from a very young age we fully understand what it is that makes it possible to turn him into a traitor his ability to lie and fake everything is what makes him into a perfect spy as his czech handler calls him and by following his life we fully understand how difficult it is to get back to the straight and narrow path once youve veered off it he trundles on even if he never get anything economic out of it except promotion by his mi5 spy masters everyones happy as long as the flow of faked information continues! magnuss father played wonderfully by ray mcanally is a no-good con-man who always dreams up schemes to con people out of their money in later years it is his son who has to bail him out again and again but by the example set by his dad and uncle who takes over as guardian when his father goes to prison and his mom is sent off to an asylum magnus quickly learns early that lying is the way of surviving not telling the truth at first he overdoes it a bit but quickly learn to tell the right lies and to be constant not changing the stories from time to time that he tell those who want to listen about himself and his dadhis czech handler alex expertly played by rüdiger weigang creates with the help of magnus a network of non-existing informants which supplies the british mi5 with fake information for years and years just as the british did with the german spies that were active in the uk before and during the war - they kept on sending fake information to das vaterland long after the agents themselves had been turned liquidated or simply been replaced by mi5 menthe young lads who play magnus in younger years does it wonderfully and most of them are more charismatic than the older little more cynic and tired pym played by egan but you buy the difference easily as that is often the way we change through life from enthusiasm to sorrow or indifferenceindeed well worth the money!<SEP>1
i really liked this film all three starsconneryfishburne and underwood give credible performances;and harris is enjoyably over the top the lighting and shot angles in some of harris scenes make his face look truly diabolical the surprising turn of plot at the end makes it interesting not a great movie but an enjoyable one i gave it 7 of 10<SEP>1
the golden era of disney cartoons was dying by the time the end of the 90s this show quack pack shouldnt even be considered a ducktales spin off because the show barely had anything to do with ducktales its about a teen-aged huey dewey and louie as they make trouble for their uncle donald and talk in hip-hop lingo and they are fully dressed unlike in ducktales i prefer the little adventurous nephews from ducktales there are humans in duckburg and the ducks are the only animals living in duckburg theres no references of scrooge mcduck the stories are repetitive the plot is boring but the animation is good if you want lots of slapstick humor i recommend this to you if you want a better disney show watch darkwing duck or ducktales<SEP>0
with all the excessive violence in this film it couldve been nc-17 but the gore couldve been pg-13 and there were quite a lot of swears when the mum had the original jackass bad-hairdewed boy friend there was a lot of character development which made the film better to watch then after the kid came back to life as the scarecrow there was a mindless hour and ten minutes of him killing people the violence was overly excessive and i think the bodycount was higher than twelve which is a large number for movies like this almost every character in the film is stabbed or gets their head chopped off but the teacher who called him white trash and hoodlum though the character lester is anything but a hoodlum not even close i know hoods and am part hood they dont draw in class they sit there and throw stuff at the teacher the teacher deserved a more gruesome death than anyone of the characters but was just stabbed in the back there were two suspenseful scenes in the film but didnt last long enough to be scary at all as i said the killings were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story line get their heads chopped off if the gore was actually fun to see then it wouldve been nc-17 two kids describe a body they find in the cornfields they describe it as a lot gorier than it actually was they explained to the cop that there were maggots crawling around in the guys intestines his stomach had not even been cut open so there was no way maggots were in his stomach though i wouldve liked to see that the acting was pathetic characters were losers and the scarecrow could do a lot of gymnastix stunts i suggest renting this movie for the death scenes i wont see it again anytime soon but i enjoyed the excessive violence also dont bother with the sequel i watched five minutes of it and was bored to death it sounds good but isnt the original scarecrow actually kept me interested<SEP>0
the national gallery of art showed the long-thought lost original uncut version of this film on july 10 2005 it restores vital scenes cut by censors upon its release the character of the cobbler a moral goody-goody individual in the original censored release of 1933 is here presented as a follower of the philosopher nietsze and urges her to use men to claw her way to the top also the corny ending of the original which i assume is in current vhs versions is eliminated and the ending is restored to its original form a wonderful film of seduction and power hopefully there will a reissue of this film on dvd for all to appreciate its great qualities look for it<SEP>1
in all the comments praising or damning daltons performance i thought he was excellent he does not play rochester as a spoiled pretty rich boy but as a roguish powerful man i liked this version although the shot on video aspect was sometimes distracting and the scenes with jane and st john never quite gelled i give this an 8<SEP>1
the van trotta movie rosenstrasse is the best movie i have seen in years i am actually not really interested in films with historical background but with this she won my interest for that time!!the only annoying thing about the movie have been the scenes in new york and the impression i had of trying to be as american as possible which i think has absolutely failedthe scenes in the back really got to my heart the german actress katja riemann completely deserved her award she is one of the most impressing actress i have ever seen in future i will watch more of her movies great luck for me that i am a native german speaking = and only for a year in the us so as soon as i am back ill buy some riemann dvdsso to all out there who have not seen this movie yet: watch it!!! i think it would be too long to describe what it is all about yet especially all the flash backs and switches of times are hard to explain but simply watcxh it you will be zesty!!!!!!!<SEP>1
even for the cocaine laced 1980s this is a pathetic i dont understand why someone would want to waste celluloid time effort money and audience brain cells to make such drivel if your going to make a comedy make it funny if you want to film trash like this keep it to yourself if youre going to release it as a joke like this: dont!!! i mean it was a joke right someone please tell me this was a joke please<SEP>0
being a fan of the first lion king i was definitely looking forward to this movie but i knew there was really no way it could be as good as the original i know that many disney fans are wary of the direct-to-video movies as i have mixed feelings of them as wellwhile watching the lion king 1½ i tried to figure out what my own viewpoint was regarding this movie am i going to be so devout about the lion king that i will nitpick at certain scenes or am i just going to accept this movie as just another look at the lion king story most of the time i found myself embracing the latterthe lion king 1½ definitely has its cute and funny moments timon and pumbaa stole the show in the first movie and definitely deserved a movie that centered around them people just love these characters! my favorite parts of the movie include the montage of timon & pumbaa taking care of young simba and the surprise ending featuring some great cameosi could have done without many of the bathroom jokes though like the real reason everyone bowed to baby simba at the beginning of lion king 1 i guess those types of jokes are for the younger set which after all is the target audience i dont think many kids are really concerned about disneys profit margin on direct-to-video movieshowever i will say that i was somewhat annoyed when they directly tied in scenes from the original movie to this movie im just too familiar with the original that those scenes just stuck out like sore thumbs to me something would be different with the music or the voices that it would just distract meas for the music it wasnt too bad but dont expect any classics to come from this movie at least lk2 had the nice ballad love will find a way as for the voicework it was well done in this movie nathan lane and ernie sabella did a great job as always and even new cast members the classic comedic actor jerry stiller and julie kavner best known as marge simpson did a great job also you can even enjoy these great voice talents even more by checking out the virtual safari on disc 2 of the dvd that feature is definitely a lot of fun!!so all in all the lion king 1½ isnt a perfect movie but its cute and entertaining i think many lion king fans will enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is - a fun lighthearted look at the lion king masterpiece from our funny friends perspectivesmy imdb rating: 710 my yahoo! grade: b good<SEP>1

wimpy stuffed shirt armand louque blandly played by veteran character actor dean jagger in a rare lead role joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies armand falls for the lovely claire duval fetching blonde dorothy stone who uses the meek sap to get armands colleague clifford grayson the hopelessly wooden robert noland to marry her furious over being used and spurned by claire armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to get revenge sound exciting well it sure aint for starters victor halperins static nondirection lets the meandering and uneventful talk-ridden story plod along at an excruciatingly slow pace worse yet halperin crucially fails to bring any tension atmosphere and momentum to the hideously tedious proceedings the mostly blah acting from a largely insipid cast doesnt help matters any; only george cleveland as the hearty general duval and e alyn warren as the irascible dr trevissant manage to enliven things a bit with their welcome and refreshing hammy histrionics the drippy stock film library score the painfully obvious stagebound sets and the crude cinematography are pretty lousy and unimpressive as well in fact this feeble excuse for a fright feature is so crummy that not even the uncredited starkly staring eyes of the great bela lugosi can alleviate the brain-numbing boredom a dismally dull dud<SEP>0
i just came back from el otro playing here in buenos aires and i have to say i was very disappointed the film is very slow moving dont get me wrong i enjoy slow moving films! slow to the point of driving you crazy all you hear is julio chavez breathing heavily throughout the whole film this is a poorly made film but more importantly it is a film without a lick of inspiration i felt nothing for the story or its charactersel otro was made only for the sake of making a film making it forgetful i would advise you to pass on this one if you want to see good argentinian films look for films by sorin<SEP>0
bettie page was a icon of the repressed 1950s when she represented the sexual freedom that was still a decade away but high in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young adults gretchen mol does a superb job of portraying the scandalous bettie who was a small town girl with acting ambitions and a great body her acting career went nowhere but her body brought her to the peak of fame in an admittedly fringe field photogrsphed in black and white with color interludes when she gets out of the world of exploitation in new york this made-for-tv hbo film has good production values and a very believable supporting cast the problem is its emotionally rather flat its difficult to form an attachment to the character since bettie is portrayed as someone quite shallow and naive given the business she was in the self-serving government investigations are given a lot of screen time which slows down the film towards the end but its definitely worth watching for the history of the time and to see the heavy-handed government repression that was a characteristic of the fifties 710<SEP>1

this is a classic stinker with a big named cast mostly seniors who were well past their prime and bedtime in this onethis is quite a depressing film when you think about it remain on earth and you will face illness and eventually your demisegwen verndon showed that she could still dance too bad the movie didnt concentrate more on that maureen stapleton looking haggard still displayed those steps from queen of the star dust ballroom so much more down to earth from 10 years earlieri only hope that this film doesnt encourage seniors to commit mass suicide on the level of jim jones how can anyone be idiotic enough to like this and say it gets you to thinkwhy did don ameche win an oscar for this nonsenseif the seniors were doing such a wonderful thing at the end why was the youngster encouraged to get off the boat why did steve guttenberg jump ship as well after all he had found his lady-love this would have been a nice film if the seniors had just managed to find their fountain of youth on earth and stay theresadly with the exception of wilford brimley at this writing vernon gilford stapleton ameche tandy cronyn and lord knows who else are all gone the writers should have taken the screenplay and placed it with this group as well<SEP>0
my wife and i are semi amused by howie mandels show i also like shatner - even when hes at his most patheticbut this is absolutely the worst show on televisionplease cancel this show it sucks a**the only positive thing i can say is that the girls are hotter on this show and seem to wear less clothing than deal or no dealthe questions are a mixture of way too easy and incredibly obscure and watching shatner or the contestant say show me the money makes me want to vomitthis one will not last<SEP>0
robin williams gave a fine performance in the night listener as did the other cast members however the movie seems rushed and leaves too many loose ends to be considered a must see i think the problem happens because there isnt a strong enough relationship established between the caller and the gabriel nooni had to spell it this way because imdb wants to auto correct the right spelling to no one character the movie runs a little over 01:30 and within the first 15 minutes or so it seems noon begins his search for pete logande the boy callerthis happens after he talks to the mysterious caller about 3 or 4 times the conversations arent too in-depth mostly consisting of how are you im in the hospitalwhy did you boyfriend move out etc in the book the kid almost becomes noons shrink and vice versa and the reader understands why he goes in search of this boy once he finds out the kid disappears and thinks he might be a hoaxin the movie noon becomes obsessed with finding logande but the audience is left to wonder why since there really isnt a strong enough bond established between noon and the caller why bother who cares if the caller doesnt exist i know theres a difference between a book and a movie but those calls and that relationship was critical to establish on screen because it provides the foundation for the rest of the movie since it doesnt the movie falls apartthis is surprising because of maupins other work tales of the city when it was made into a mini-series it worked beautifully<SEP>0
this overrated short-lived series a measly two seasons is about as experimental and unique as a truck driver going to a strip bar i am not quite sure what they mean by ground-breaking and original when they fawn all over lynch and his silly little tv opus what exactly is their criteria of what is original sure compared to the bill cosby show or hill street blues its original definitely next to law & order tp spews originality left and rightfans of tp often say that the show was canceled because too many viewers werent smart enough open enough for the shows supposed weirdness its alleged wild ingenuity or whatever as a fan of weirdness myself i have to correct that misconception there is nothing too off-the-wall about tp; it is a merely watchable rather silly whodunit that goes around in circles spinning webs in every corner but or because of it ultimately going nowhere the supposed weirdness is always forced; the characters dont behave in a strange way as much as they behave in an idiotic way half the time theres a differencewhenever i watch the weird dream sequence in living in oblivion in which the dwarf criticizes the director buscemi for succumbing to the tired old lets-use-a-midget-in-a-dream-scene cliché i think of lynch you want weird eraserhead is weird - in fact its beyond weird its basically abstract you want a unique tv show watch the prisoner you want a strange-looking cast felinis and leones films offer that tp looks like an overly coiffed tv crime drama in which all the young people look like fashion models the cast gives tp a plastic look kens & barbies en massein fact one of the producers of tp said that lynch was looking for unique faces for the series unique faces like lara flynn boyles sheryll fenns like those effeminate-faced hunks straight out of mens catalogs or gay magazines dont get me wrong; there is nothing wrong with getting an attractive cast especially with beauties like fenn the way madonna would look if she were 1000 times prettier but then dont go around saying youre making a weird show with weird-looking people and i have never understood lynchs misguided fascination with kyle maclachlan i should get a medal for bothering to spell his name right he is not unlikable but lacks charisma seeming a little too bland and polished his characters laughable eccentricities were not at all interesting merely one of lynchs many attempts to force the weirdness trying hard to live up to his reputation - him having completely lost his edge but that time everything lynch made post-elephant man was very much sub-par compared to his first two movies what followed were often mediocre efforts that relied on lynchs relatively small but fanatical fan base to keep him in the public eye by interpreting meanings into his badly put-together stories that dont hold any water on closer scrutiny in other words lynch is every intellectual-wannabes darling so laura palmer was killed by her dad he was obsessed by the devil or some such nonsense thats the best this great mind could come up with youve got b-movie horror films that end with more originality lynch is neither bright nor hard-working enough to come up with a terrific storygo to http:rateyourmusiccom~fedor8 and check out my tv & cinema: 150 worst cases of nepotism list<SEP>0

in my humble opinion this version of the great bdwy musical has only two things going for it - tyne daly and the fact that there is now a filmed version with the original script ok vanessa williams is good to watchbut to me thats all there is most of the cast seem to be walking through the show - chynna phillips has no idea who kim really is and no wonder people walk over harry mcafee when its played by george wendt who looks like hed rather be back on a bar stool in boston jason alexander is passable but that wig has to go and i saw better dancing in bugsy malone as i mentioned its good to have a version of the stage script now but i hope the young out there who have never seen a musical dont judge them all by this<SEP>0
as if the storyline wasnt depressing enough this movie shows cows being butchered graphically in a slaughterhouse for all of five minutes while the protagonist is narrating her early life as a butcher weird stuff then theres the core premise of the heroheroine who goes and cuts his dick off because a hes besot-ten with at work says he would have gone with him if he was a girl is this person a psycho a masochist just a doomed queen who takes things too far and what sort of traumatic childhood did he have just that he didnt get adopted and had to live it out with nuns who at first loved him and then later hated him because he was unruly he tries to explain to us the reasons he did what he did but its really really so hard to empathize such sad and unusual self destruction was it supposed to be funny what was it all about really<SEP>0
being a fan of silent films i looked forward to seeing this picture for the first time i was pretty disappointed as has been mentioned the film seems to be one long long commercial for the maxwell automobile perhaps if the chase scene was about half the length that it is i may have enjoyed the film more but it got old very fast and while i recognize that reality is stretched many times in films without lessening a viewers enjoyment what was with the mexican bandits i mean they are chasing a car through the mountains a car that most of the time is moving at about one mile per hour yet they cant catch up to it<SEP>0
first love is a desperately difficult subject to pull off convincingly in cinema : the all-encompassing passion involved generally ends up as a pale imitation or worse slightly ridiculouslifshitz manages to avoid all the pitfalls and delivers a moving sexy thoroughly engrossing tale of love disaster and possible redemption while tangentially touching on some of the deeper themes in human existencethe core story is of mathieu 18 a solitary introverted boy who meets cédric brasher more outgoing but just as lonely while on holiday with his family as the summer warms on they fall in love and when the holidays end decide to live together a year later the relationship ends in catastrophe: cédric cheats on mathieu who distraught tries to take his own life he survives and in order to get perspective back on his life he returns to the seaside town where they first met this time cloaked in the chill of winterif the tale was told like this it would never have the impact it does: much of it is implied all of it happens non-sequentiallythe intricate narrative is essential to getting a deeper feeling of the passions experienced through the use of counterpoint and temporal perspective fortunately the three time-lines used the summer of love the post-suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction are colour coded: warm yellows and oranges for the summer an almost frighteningly chill blue for the hospital scenes and warming browns and blues for the winter seasideboth main actors put in excellent performances though whilst its a delight to see stéphane rideau cédric used to his full capacity im more used to seeing him under-stretched in gael morels rather limp dramas jérémie elkaim mathieu has to be singled out for special mention: you can feel his loneliness then his almost incredulous passion then his character crumbling behind a wall of aphasia beautifully crafted gestures get across far more than dialogue ever couldthe themes touched upon are almost classic in french cinema: our difficulty in really understanding what another is feeling; our difficulty in communicating fully; the shifting sands of meaning the films title presque rien almost nothing points to all of these and indeed to one of the key scenes in the film: in trying to understand why mathieu attempted to kill himself a psychiatrist asks cédric if he had ever cheated on him non enfin oui une fois mais ce nétait rien no well yes once but it was nothing cédric still loves mathieu  he brought him to the hospital during the suicide attempt none of which we see and tries desperately to contact him again once he leaves  but cannot understand that he has lost him forever because something that seemed nothing to him a meaningless affair is everything to mathieuwhilst the film is darker than the rather unfortunate pierre et gilles poster would suggest it is not without hope: we get to see cédrics slow painful attempts to get back in touch with life first through a cat he adopts then through work in a local bar and finally contact with pierre who may be his next love but here the story ends: a teenage passion over within the year another perhaps beginning so what was it almost nothing certainly not when youre living it<SEP>1
a town called hell aka a town called bastard a britishspanish co-production was made on the heels of clint eastwoods success in the italian made man with no name trilogy the template used in most of these films was to hire recognizable american actors whose careers were largely in decline and dub their voices this film is no exception except for the fact that they used some british actors as wellits difficult to summarize the plot but here goes the story opens with rebels or whatever led by robert shaw and marin landau raiding a church and killing everyone inside including the priest fast forward to the subject town a few years later where the shaw character is masquerading as a priest the mayor of the town telly savalas is a brutal leader who thinks nothing of meting out justice with his gunthrow into the mix a grieving widow alvira stella stevens who is searching for her husbands killer add to this the fact that she rides around in a hearse lying dead like in a coffin for god knows why after the mayor is murdered by his henchman la bomba al lettieri the town is invaded by a federale colonel landau in search of a rebel leader im sorry but the name escapes me the colonel takes over the town and begins summarily executing the townsfolk to force them to reveal the identity of the leadereven though they opened the film side by side its difficult to tell from the dialog that the landau and shaw characters know each other a blind man fernando rey claims he can identify the rebel leader by touching his face he does so andim sure the principals regretted making this film its just plain awful and well deserving of my dreaded 1 rating shaw spends most of the film fixating his trademark stare at whomever is handy even landau cant salvage this film the beautiful ms stevens is totally wasted here too having just made peckinpahs the ballad of cable hogue the previous year i found it odd that she would appear in this mess of a movie savalas made several of these pictures pancho villa and horror express come to mind during he pre-kojak periodmichael craig is also in it somewhere as a character called pacofernando rey appeared in many of these westerns although he would emerge to play the villain in the two french connection films al lettieri would also emerge with a role in the godfather 1972 and go on to other memorable roles before his untimely death in 1975in all fairness the version i watched ran only 88 minutes rather than the longer running times of 95 or 97 minutes listed on imdb however i cant see where an extra 7 or 8 minutes would make much differenceavoid this one<SEP>0
the plot is plausible but banal ie beautiful and neglected wife of wealthy and powerful man has a fling with a psychotic hunk then tries to cover it up as the psycho stalks and blackmails her but what develops from there is stupefyingly illogical despite the resources that are available to the usual couple who has money and influence our privileged hero and heroine appear to have only one domestic their attorney and local police who say they can do nothing at their disposal while they grapple with suspense and terror they have no private security staff only a fancy security system that they mishandle household or grounds staff chauffeurs etc not even apparently the funds to hire private round-the-clock nurses to care for the hero when he suffers life-threatening injuries leaving man and wife alone and vulnerable in their mansion our heroine is portrayed as having the brains of a doorknob and our hero a tycoon behaves in the most unlikely and irrational manner the production is an insult to viewers who wasted their time with this drivel and a crime for having wasted the talents of veteran actors oliva hussey and don murray what were they thinking and shame on lifetime tv for insulting the intelligence of its audience for this insipid offering<SEP>0
this movie is complete crap! avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs it is rambling and incoherent i pride myself on plumbing the depths of 70s sleaze cinema from everything from salo to salon kitty i like being shocked but i need a coherent story however if watching horses mate gets you off this film is for you the saddest part was that lame werewolf suit with the functional wang i mean its just plain hard to sit through not to mention the acting is terrible and the soundtrack is dubbed badly please i know the cover is interesting what looks like a gorillas hands reaching for a womans bare assbut dont waste your time or money as you wont get either back<SEP>0
superb i had initially thought that given amrita pritams communist leanings and dr dwivedis nationalist leanings film will be more frank than novel but when i read the novel i was surprised to find that it was reversekudos to marita pritam for not being pseudo-sec and to dr dwivedi to be objective this movie touches a sensitive topic in a sensitive way casualty of any war are women as some poet said and this movie personifies it it is also a sad commentary on hindu psyche as they cant stand up against kidnappers of their girls or the hindu brother who can only burn the fields of his tormentor on the other hand it also shows economic angles behind partition or in fact why girls were kidnapped in the first place i think kidnappers thought that by kidnapping girls they will become legal owners of the houses and thus new govt will not be able to ask them to return the houses this apart one has to salute the courage of characters of puro and her bhabhi they are two simple village girls unmindful of outside world and risk everytihng by trying to come back after being dishonored because there are many documented cases when such women were not accepted by their families in indiano wonder that it required a woman to understand the pains of other women<SEP>1
you can do a lot with a little cash blair witch proved that this film supports it it is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity however because it has john cleese as sherlock holmes it manages to be hilarious even on a budget that couldnt afford a shoestring the highlight of this film is arthur lowe as the sincere bumbling watson his dimness and slowness foils cleeses quick-tempered wit if you ever run across the film watch it for a quirky laugh or two<SEP>1
im not a steve carell fan however i like this movie about dan an advice columnist who goes to his parents house for a stay with his kids and ends up falling in love with his brothers girlfriend its a story thats been told before but not like this there are simply too many little bits that make the film better than it should be the cast is wonderful and even if carell is not my cup of tea he is quite good as the widower whos suppose to know everything but finds that knowing is different than feeling and that sometimes life surprises you at times witty and wise in the way that an annoying hallmark card can be the film still some how manages to grow on you and be something more than a run of the mill film worth a look see<SEP>1
eric rohmers the lady and the duke is based on the journals of an english aristocrat who lived through the french revolution but its a stilted affair with its strange painted backdrops and mannered conversational tone most notably this portrait of age of terror takes place almost entirely at one remove from the real action; one sees very little of ordinary people in this movie and little of the chaos poverty and terror that unfolded away from the drawing rooms of the persecuted but spoilt aristocratic classes the result is frequently dull and ultimately unenlightening about the forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction; its a disappointing film from an acclaimed director<SEP>0
spoilers in first paragraph this movies anti-german sentiment seems painfully dated now but its a brilliant example of great war-time propaganda it was made back when cecil b demille was still a great director ignore all his later best picture academy awards; he never made a very good sound film this movie lacks the comedy of most of pickfords other films and really it was demilles movie not pickfords the vilification of the germans can be compared to the way the patriot of 2000 did the same to the british the only good german in the film was a reluctant villain who had the ironic name of austreheim they even had pickford take an ill-fated trip on a luxury ship that gets torpedoed by a german submarine so whatll get the americans more stirred up to war the sinking of the lusitania or watching americas favorite canadian import sinking in it all throughout the film demille runs his protagonist from one kind of horrible calamity to another barely escaping death hypothermia depravity rape execution and explosions that go off in just the right place to keep her unharmed the way she is saved from a firing squad is no more believable than the way the humans in jurassic park were ultimately rescued from the velociraptors if i was any more gullible to such propaganda i would punish myself for having a part-german ancestry was it a good film aside from a humorous running gag about americans abroad thinking theyre untouchable  that was apparently a joke even back then  you might not be entertained youll find it more than a little melodramatic and obviously one-sided but the first thing that came to my mind after watching it is that it was years before potemkins false portrayal of a massacre revolutionized the language of cinema as well as a movies potential for propaganda it made me wonder: what became of cecil b demille somewhere between the advent of sound and the greatest show on earth he seemed to lose his ambition ben hur looked expensive but not ambitious in a sentence this movie is for 1 film historians 2 silent film buffs 3 mary pickford fans or 4 demille fans if such a person exists<SEP>1
i once thought that the stoned age was the worst film ever made i was wrong hobgoblins surpassed it in every way i could imagine and a few i couldnt in the stoned age i hated the characters in hobgoblins i hated the actors and everyone else involved in creating this atrocity i wont include a teaser to this film im not that cruel i couldnt subject innocent people such as yourselves to such torment in fact any discussion of plot pertaining to this film is senseless and demeaning words i would use to describe this film are as follows: insipid asinine and ingenuousin conclusion please dont watch this film i beg of you from one movie lover to another no from one human being to another please for the sake of your own sanity and intellect do not watch it destroy any copies you come across<SEP>0
sure it may not be a classic but its one full of classic lines one of the few movies my friends and i quote from all the time and this is fifteen years later maybe it was on cinemax one too many times! michael keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie--he cant seem to figure out how to play it-- but hes surrounded by a fantastic cast who know exactly how to play this spoof looking for a movie to cheer you up this is it but rent it with friends--itll make it even better<SEP>1
fly me to the moon has to be the worst animated film ive seen in a long time thats saying something since i have taken my son to see every animated release for the last 4 years now the story is to be generoustrite the voice acting is atrocious too cute sounding the humor is of the romper room variety the animation is passable for a nickolodeon type of cartoon but this is being released on the big screen not cable televisionit gets a 2 only because of its ok 3-d visuals some of the scenes had a mildly stimulating image but weve seen much better in the past i also question the insistence of the filmmakers to have characters fly away from the screen rather than into it in most of the scenes while that is interesting at first it became tiresome after the 3rd or 4th time it seemed to smack of indifference to me on the part of the creatorsi will say this though it had a pretty cool soundtrack and for the record my son wasnt too crazy about it either bad movie<SEP>0
i only rented this movie because of promises of william dafoe and robert rodriguez i assumed that upon seeing rrs name on the cover as an actor that this movie would be good it sounds like a movie that rodriguez would of made so if hes going to lend his name to it than it has to be good right wrong wrong wrong by far the worst editing since manos hands of fate the way it was edited made no sense and made the movie impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you wont even want to try to follow it anymore i have no idea how dafoe and rodriguez got involved in this film maybe they owed somebody but they are way to good for this besides they were only in this movie for a couple minutes apiece and rodriguez didnt even talk so if you wanna see a movie with poor editing poor acting and confusing storyline than be my guest but dont say you werent warned<SEP>0

take:1 a famous play2 a director with now ideas of his own who is using3 a copy of the stage design of a popular theatre production of the play mentioned in 14 an actor for the lead - who has no feeling for the part hes playing and youll get: hamlet prinz von dänemarki listened to the radio play of hamlet with maximilian schell as hamlet and i was so disappointed i hoped that the filmed version would be better that schell would at least have a body language to underline what hes saying - nothing then the set the minimalistic design is not everyones taste but usually i like it when theres just enough on the stage to make clear whats the setting and nothing more alas thats on a stage in a theatre it wont work in a film based on a play that actually has believable settings that the idea for the set was copied from the theatre production in which schell played the hamlet already lets say if that was the only thing to complain about i ask myself how schell could get the part of hamlet anywhere in first place and how anybody could allow him to play hamlet a second time if youve got the choice to view any of the about sixty films based on hamlet dont watch this one unless youre a masochist or really hardcore or like to poke fun on untalented actors<SEP>0
sandra bernhard is quite a character and certainly one of the funniest women on earth she began as a stand-up comedienne in the 1970s but her big break came in 1983 when she starred opposite jerry lewis and robert de niro in scorseses underrated masterpiece the king of comedy her film career never quite took off though she did make a couple of odd but entertaining pictures such as dallas doll 1994 or dinner rush 2000 but the most amazing parts were those she created for herselfwithout you im nothing is undoubtedly her best effort its an adaptation of her smash-hit off-broadway show which made her a superstar  and madonnas best friend for about four years in ten perfectly choreographed and staged scenes sandra turns from nina simone to diana ross talks about her childhood andy warhol and san francisco and performs songs made famous by burt bacharach prince or sylvester director john boskovich got sandra to do a 90-minute tour-de-force performance thats both sexy and uniquely funny if you are a bernhard fan you cant miss out this film; its a tribute as well to her weird beauty as to her extremely unconventional talent as a comedienne and it has influenced filmmakers in their work  hedwig and the angry inch for instance would look a lot different if without you im nothing didnt exist<SEP>1
absolutely laughable film i live in london and the plot is so ill-researched its ridiculous no one could be terrorised on the london underground in the short time it is not in service each night there are teams of maintenance workers down there checking the tracks and performing repairs etc that there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely or that its even possible to get locked in and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and agethe worst thats likely to happen if someone did find themselves there after the last train is that they might get graffiti sprayed on them although this has been coming under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network another thorn in the side of the story remember in london as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the worldif it had been set in a city i am not familiar with perhaps i could have enjoyed it through ignorance but its not a high quality film so i just couldnt bring myself to suspend my disbelief and try and enjoy it for the banal little tale that it isi would have given it 010 if such a rating existed! possibly the most disappointing film i ever thought i would like<SEP>0
this one was marred by potentially great matches being cut very shortthe opening match was a waste of the legion of doom but i guess the only way they could have been eliminated by demolition was a double-dq otherwise mr perfect would have had to put in overtime kerry von erich the i-c champ was wasted here and this was the third ppv in a row where perfect jobbed remember before that he never lost a matchthe second match was very good possibly the best of the night ted dibiase and the undertaker were excellent while the jim neidhart had one of his wwf highlights pinning the honky tonk man koko b ware continued his tradition of being the first to put over a new heel remember the big bossman and yokozuna this was a foreshadowing of bret harts singles career as he came back from two-on-one and almost survived the match he and dibiase put on a wrestling clinic making us forget that the point of the match was dibiases boring feud with dusty rhodeseven though the visionaries were the first team to have all of its members survive and only the second since 87 to have four survivors this match was not a squash this was the longest match of the night and jake did a repeat of his 88 performance when he was left alone against four men and dominated i think he could have actually pulled off an upset these days the match would have ended the other way aroundone of the shortest ss matches ever was also one of its most surprising possibly the most underrated wrestler ever tito santana was the inspirational wrestler of the night putting on war paint and pinning boris zukhov tanaka and even the warlord in the final survival match it was so strange to see him put over so overwhelmingly then go right back to his mediocre career sgt slaughter also did well getting rid of volkoff and the bushwhackers but that just wasnt a surprise tito wasi think the only point of the survival match was to have hogan and the warrior win together at the endthis show was boring and the matches were too short the undertakers debut was cool but tito santana is the reason i will remember this one<SEP>0
this movie was the best movie i have ever seen being lds i highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of joseph smith although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone i saw this movie with my family and i can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart this movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with after i saw this moviethere was not a single dry eye in the entire room everyone was touched by what they saw and i have not been the same since i have seen it i highly recommend this movie for everyone<SEP>1
this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen the plot is awful and the acting is worse the jokes that are attempted absolutley suck dont bother to waste your time on a dumb movie such as this and if for some reason that you do want to see this movie dont watch it with your parents<SEP>0
i am a huge fan of the comic book series but this movie fell way below my expectations i expected a heavy metal 2000 kinda feel to itslow moving bad dialogue lots o bloodbut this was worse than anything i could have imagined the plot line is almost the same as the comic but the good points pretty much stop there the characters dont have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series the movie only covers a small portion of the comic and the portion used is more slow and boring than later parts the focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic bookwith the right people working on this project it could have been amazing sadly it wasnt that way so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love my copy will surely collect dust for years until i finally throw it out<SEP>0
this may be one of the worst movies to ever make it to production ever1 the most exciting part is the beginning where the guy is walking and walking and walking spoiler there is about 15 minutes of just walking how 2 not to mention theres a lot of issues with the lighting and its almost like they even shot the night scenes during the day 3 the acting was terrible it looks like they found a community theater in mexico and then took the people who were turned awayplease for the love of everything holy dont rent this movie if you know someone who owns it apologize to them the director should be subject to punishment through the war crimes tribunal for foisting this on the public<SEP>0
my dad is a fan of columbo and i had always disliked the show i always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is but he goes on watching it none the less that is his right as an american i guess but my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that spielberg had directed the premier episode it was then that i was thankful that my dad had bought this show that i really cant stand i went through his dvd collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college my opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed but i did gain respect for spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors and that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along get the pun haha like spielberg did its like jesus before he became a man or thats at least what i think that would feel like any ways if your fan of columbo than you would most likely like this even though it contains little of peter falk i attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet this episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of columbos investigation as many later episodes would do<SEP>0
i saw this ages ago when i was younger and could never remember the title until one day i was scrolling through john candys film credits on imdb and noticed an entry named once upon a crime something rang a bell and i clicked on it and after reading the plot summary it brought back a lot of memoriesive found it has aged pretty well despite the fact that it is not by any means a great comedy it is however rather enjoyable and is a good riff on a hitchcock formula of mistaken identity and worldwide thrillsthe movie has a large cast of characters amongst them an american couple who find a womans dog while vacationing in europe and decide to return it to her for a reward - only to find her dead body upon arrival from there the plot gets crazier and sillier and they go on the run after the police think they are the killerskind of a mix between its a mad mad mad mad world and a lighter hitchcock feature this was directed by eugene levy and he managed to get some of his good friends - such as john candy - to star in it the movie is mostly engaging due to its cast and the ending has a funny little twist that isnt totally unpredictable but also is kind of unexpected<SEP>1
after seeing all the jesse james quantrill jayhawkersetc films in the fifties it is quite a thrill to see this film with a new perspective by director ang lee the scene of the attack of lawrence kansas is awesome the romantic relationship between jewel and toby mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts and jonathan rhys-meyers is outstanding as the bad guy all the time this film makes you feel the horror of war and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they are going to survive the next hours definitely worth seeing<SEP>1
fido is to be commended for taking a tired genre zombies and turning it into a most original film experience the early 50s atmosphere is stunning the acting terrific and the entire production shows a lot of careful planning suddenly the viewer is immersed in a world of beautiful classic cars eisenhower era dress art deco furniture and zombie servants it would be very easy to dismiss fido as cartoon-like fluff similar to tank girl but the two movies are vastly different fido has structure a script that tells a story and acting that is superior make no mistake this is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed highly recommended - merk<SEP>1
this movie shows life in northern cameroon from the perspective of a young french girl france dalens whose father is an official for the colonial french government and whose family is one of the few white families around it gives a sense of what life was like both for the colonists and for the natives with whom they associated its a sense consistent with another movie ive seen about africa in a similar time period nirgendwo in afrika 2001 but i have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is its not just an impression -- things do happen in the movie -- but the plot is understated the viewer is left to draw his own conclusions rather than having the filmmakers forced upon him although the framing of the story as a flashback from the womans visit to south-western cameroon as an adult provides some perspective<SEP>1
never before have the motives of the producers of a motion picture been more transparent lets see: first they get every willing televangelist to hype this film as the greatest thing since sliced white bread next they encourage as many fundamentalist christians as possible to purchase copies of the film so as to recoup its paltry production costs and pump up its advertising budget and finally when the film hits the theaters get as many said christians as possible to see it yet again bus them into the multiplexes if necessary not on the merits of the film itself but because a #1 box office opening will be seen as some sort of profound spiritual victorybut that of course wont be enough i imagine that any film critic with the audacity to give left behind anything short of a glowing review will be deemed anti-christianof course this shamelessly manipulative marketing campaign shouldnt surprise anyone it is after all good old fashioned capitalism at work what does surprise me is how many people have been suckered into the whole left behind mindset as someone who tries to balance his spiritual beliefs with some sense of reason and rationality it leaves me scratching my head it would appear that there are many many people who actually believe that sometime in the near future a rapture is going to occur and that millions of people all over the earth are going to simultaneously vanish into thin air what kind of reality i wonder are these people living in is this rapture something they actually believe in or is it something they fervently want to believe in and when they reach the end of their lives and realize this rapture has not occurred will they be disappointed and disillusioned will there still be people 100 years from now insisting that the rapture is imminentin a way i almost wish that such an event would occur! what an interesting day that would be! what would be even more interesting is if the apocalypse were to occur in a more spectacular fashion not in the anthropological sense the authors of the left behind series have portrayed but as more of a stephen spielberg production with boiling clouds trumpets angels descending out of the sky moon turned to blood the whole nine yards imagine coming to the realization that it was all coming true just as the evangelists had been warning for years and that there was something more awesome than just the cold hard physical reality we inhabit wouldnt that be somethingyet in the final analysis its that cold hard physical reality that i will content myself with my life is not so meaningless that i need the fear of a rapture and the end times to make sense of it all nor do i need heaven or hell to bribe or scare me into behaving decently thank you very much<SEP>0
this film was horrible the script is completely unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the real-world the editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in film schooli do not recommend this film to anyone who: a knows any detail about the world of police or covert operations b knows any detail about film making or appreciationi do recommend this film to the average or below-average mind i think it would be enjoyable if i was a dumber if you must watch this film on a full mind i highly recommend some kind of inebriationit is a total waste of what little production value it has<SEP>0
ok so i am an original wicker man fan and i usually dont like british films remade by americans so why oh why did i put myself through the most painful cinema experiences ever i am not a nicolas cage fan and i had some kind of moment of madness perhaps the film was appalling! the bit at the beginning with the crashfire had no relevance to the film at all and the female cop knew where edward was going so the bit at the end with the two girls visiting the mainland well it wouldnt have happened as the whole thing would have been investigated the history behind the wicker man wasnt really explored - and i guess being set in america didnt really help the whole pagan theme this film was slow and contained no atmosphere or suspense i must say that the best bit was right at the end when nicolas cage goes up in flames! i am in such desperate need to see the original again now in order to cleanse my disappointed soul i really cant stress how disappointing this film is please dont see it if you:a dont like american re-makes of british films b are a fan of the original c hate nicolas cage<SEP>0
this movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description but to me it was a bit of a let down very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening it was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together whichever way they landed definitely not in sequential order also nothing of any consequence was being filmed i have viewed quite a few different korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewers part which is different from the typical hollywood film but this one befuddled me to no end i viewed the film a second and third time and it still didnt do anything for me i still dont really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey if it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a persons life i guess he succeeded but i was looking for more needless to say i cant recommend this movie to anyone<SEP>0
as a cinema fan white noise was an utter disappointment as a filmmaker the cinematography was pretty good nicely lit good camera work reasonable direction but as a film it just seamed as predictable as all the other so called horror movies that the market has recently been flooded with although it did have a little bit of the chill factor the whole concept of the evo electronic voice phenomena didnot seem believable this movie did not explain the reasonings for certain occurrences but went ahead with them the acting was far from mind blowing the main character portrayed no emotion like many recent thrillerhorror moviesdefinitely not a movie i will be buying on dvd and would not recommend anyone rushes out to see it<SEP>0
i always wrote this series off as being a complete stink-fest because jim belushi was involved in it and heavily but then one day a tragic happenstance occurred after a white sox game ended i realized that the remote was all the way on the other side of the room somehow now i could have just gotten up and walked across the room to get the remote or even to the tv to turn the channel but then why not just get up and walk across the country to watch tv in another state nuts to that i said so i decided to just hang tight on the couch and take whatever fate had in store for me what fate had in store was an episode of this show an episode about which i remember very little except that i had once again made a very broad general sweeping blanket judgment based on zero objective or experiential evidence with nothing whatsoever to back my opinions up with and once again i was completely right! this show is a total crud-pie! belushi has all the comedic delivery of a hairy lighthouse foghorn the women are physically attractive but too stepford-is to elicit any real feeling from the viewer there is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running down to the local tv station with a can of gasoline and a flamethrower and sending every copy of this mutt howling back to hell except except for the wonderful comic sty lings of larry joe campbell americas greatest comic character actor this guy plays belushis brother-in-law andy and he is gold how good is he really well aside from being funny his job is to make belushi look good thats like trying to make butt warts look good but campbell pulls it off with style someone should invent a nobel prize in comic buffoonery so he can win it every year without larry joe this show would consist of a slightly vacant looking courtney thorne-smith smacking belushi over the head with a frying pan while he alternately beats his chest and plays with the straw on the floor of his cage 5 stars for larry joe campbell designated comedic bacon because he improves the flavor of everything hes in!<SEP>0
were talking about a low budget film and its understandable that there are some weaknesses no spoilers: one sudden explosives expert and one meaningless alcoholic; but in general the story keeps you interested most of the characters are likable and there are some original situations i really like films that surprise you with some people that are not who they want you to believe and then twist and turn the plot i applaud this one on that if you know what i mean try to see also nueve reinas nine queens a film from argentina<SEP>1
everything a great documentary could be yeah if one is deaf dumb and blind everything but meaning wit visual style and interesting subject matter aside from that seriously volken this is a movie that is completely inauthentic an adventure doc with no adventure a war doc with no feeling for war a campy send-up with no trace of wit it means nothing feels like nothing and carries the implicit message that absolutely nothing matters no wonder it has so many imdb fans! of course going in you know a movie starring the great skip lipman will have no culture no intelligence no wit other than a corrosive adolescent jokiness and no recognizable human emotion  just adrenaline darkon isnt a movie -- its a panic attack! avoid there too many real documentaries and too little time in life to waste it on toilet build-up such as darkon<SEP>0
i must have been only 11 when mr peepers started it was a must see for the whole family i believe on sun nights repeating gags were rob opening his locker he had to use a yardstick or pointer to gage the right spot on another locker and do some other things finally kicking the spot whereupon his door would open and taking pins out of a new shirtat the start of an episode he would open up a package with a new dress shirt and for the rest of the show be finding one pin after another that he missed when unwrapping the shirt timing was everything and the pins got lots of laughs i remember an aunt that drove a rio like jack benny and always wanted sonny to say something scientific he would think and come up with semi permeable membrane or osmosis causing her to say how brilliant he was you had to have been there marion lorne stole the show every time she was on screen why they didnt continue the series from her pov when wally quit he was afraid he was being typecast but by then it was way too lateill never know i saw somewhere that the 1st tv wedding big one anyway was tiny tim on the carson show horsecocky it was rob and nancy did i ever have the hots for her and i remember it made the cover of tv guide and got press in all the papers and major magazines a trip to the museum of broadcasting in nyc years ago was disappointing in that they had very few episodes then and those might be gone now i still remember it as wonderful and wish i had been a little older<SEP>1
ronald reagan and a bunch of us soldiers in a north korean pow camp they are tortured we learn north korean communists are bad people we learn americans beards grow very slowly during days of torturei tried to suppress it but i finally burst out laughing at this movie it was the scene when mr reagan comes out from telling the communists he wants to be on their side then he asks for a bottle of brandy next acting stone-cold sober he takes a drunken companion dewey martin to get sulfur to cure mr martins hangover of course the north korean communist guard is as dumb as they come so the drunk distracts the guard while reagan goes over to get something from a drawer which is next to a bunch of empty boxes im sure he boxes were supposed to contain something; but of course reagan causes them to shake enough to reveal they are empty ya gotta laugh! i think prisoner of war will appeal mainly to family and friends of those who worked on it - otherwise its wasteful * prisoner of war 1954 andrew marton ~ ronald reagan steve forrest dewey martin<SEP>0
the only reason i even watched this was because i found it at my local library and will berate them mercilessly for having wasted public monies on it and despite the plethora of tits and ass it didnt take long to realize that the fast-forward button was my friend terrible direction pedestrian camera work sporadically bad-to-nearly-passable acting chintzy effects and one of the worst screenplays ive had the displeasure of seeing brought to life such as it was horribly crippled and mutilated in a long long time best laughs actually come from the making of featurette in which the poor saps involved with this hdv mess attempt to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special instead of something that wont be utterly forgotten next week wait! except for the fact that somehow someone lured tippi the birds hedren of all people into doing a bit part along with kane friday the 13th hodder! how this came to pass ill never know and to be honest i dont really care watch at your own risk and dont say you havent been warned this is film-making at its pretentious craven worst it only gets a 2 from me for having some good-looking naked women and even then just barely<SEP>0
this movie is very entertaining and any critique is based on personal preferences - not the films quality other than the common excessive profanity in some scenes by murphy the film is a great vehicle for his type of humor it has some pretty good special effects and exciting action scenesas a finder of lost children murphys character starts off looking for a missing girl which leads him on the path for which others believe he was chosen - - to protect the golden child the young boy is born as an enlightened one destined to save the world from evil forces but whose very life is in danger if not for the help of murphy and his beautiful mysterious and mystical helperguideprotectoralso there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience members who are interested in pondering deep thoughts one such scene is where the golden child that murphys character is solicited to protect is tested by the monks of the mountain temple an elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from and the child is tested on his choicethis is a fantasycomedy that is based on the notion that there are both good and evil forces in our world of which most people are completely unaware as we accept this premise of the plot we must let go of our touch with a perceived daily reality and prepare for the earth and walls to crumble away and reveal a realm of evil just waiting to destroy usthis is an excellent movie with a good plot fine acting and for the most part pretty decent dialogue combining a serious topic with a healthy balance of martial art fighting and eddie murphy humor<SEP>1
this movie isnt as bad as i heard it was enjoyable funny and i love that is revolves around the holiday season it totally has me in the mood to christmas shop and listen to holiday music when this movie comes out on dvd it will take the place of christmas vacation in my collection it will be a movie to watch every year after thanksgiving to get me in the mood for the best time of the year i heard that bens character was a bit crazy but i think it just adds to the movie and why be so serious all the time take it for what is it a christmas comedy with a love twist i enjoyed it no it isnt titanic and it wont make your heart pound with anticipation but it will bring on a laugh or two so go laugh and have a good time:<SEP>1
i picked up tran scan from the library and brought it home we have considered taking a trip out east and thought it would give us a feel of what it was like the film was a total waste of time if i went out to buy it i would call it tran scam when i saw that it costs $49the dvd ran for 8 minutes and showed a roller coaster ride across canada with my stomach feeling ill as they went up and down and around curve with the film at high speedthere was a lot of footage they probably shot on this and you would think that they could have made a better product if i would of done this project i would of provided more footage paused on road signs to let people know where they were and linger in places to view the scenery to make a film like this it should of been 60 to 90min oh yes the case said it was in stereo the whole film was a hissing sound from sped up car sound thet could of at least put some music to itif you want a good cross canada film watch the railrodder national film board of canada starring buster keaton the one of the last film he made in this comical film buster keaton gets on to a railway trackspeeder in nova scotia and travels to british columbia<SEP>0
radio was not a 24 hour 7days a week happening when i grew up in the 1930s england so childrens hour was a treat for me when we had batteries and an accumulator to spare for the power the few programmes i heard therefore made a great impression on my young mind and the 3 that i recall still are toytown one about all the animals at the zoo and --- grey owl talking about the animals he knew which he called his brothers it was only in recently that i learnt that grey owl wasnt a genuine indian but the tribute paid by the sioux chief makes great sense to me a man becomes what he dreams would that we could all dream as world changing and beneficial as archie grey owl belaney would that a new grey owl could influence world leaders to clean up the environment<SEP>1
an insomniacs nightmare was an incredibly interesting well-made film i loved the way it just throws you into the main characters subconscious without coddling the viewerthe acting was top notch - honestly i would watch dominic monaghan read the phone book! - but everyone else especially the young girl was great as well i was very impressed by the look of the film too usually independent films have a grainy i-shot-this-on-my-camcorder look to them but this director knows what shes doing the lighting the cinematographyquality work im looking forward to a feature-length work from tess nanavati!<SEP>1
this a rip roaring western and i have watched it many times and it entertains on every levelhowever if your after the true facts about such legends as hickcockcody and calamity jane then look elsewhere as john ford suggested this is the west when the truth becomes legend print the legendthe story moves with a cracking pace and there is some great dialogue between gary cooper and jean arthur two very watchable stars who help to make this moviethe sharp eyed amongst you might just spot gabby hayes as an indian scout also there is a very young anthony quinn making his debut as cayenne warrior he actually married one of demilles daughters in real lifeindeed its quinns character who informs cooper of the massacre of custer told in flash back the finale is well done and when the credits roll it fuses the american west with american historyso please take time out to watch this classic western<SEP>1
i gave this movie a single star only because it was impossible to give it lessscientists have developed a formula for replicating any organism in their laba run down warehouse in la they create a t-rex a group of industrial spies break in to steal the formula and the remainder of the film is one endless foot chaseof course the t-rexa rubber puppetgets loose and commences to wipe out the cast it has the amazing ability to sneak up within 2 or 3 feet of someone without them noticing and then promptly bites their head offone cast member escapes in a police car and spends the remainder of the film driving aimlessly through the city she is of such superior mental ability that she cant even operate the radio she never makes any attempt to drive to a substation or a donut shop and appears hopelessly lostthe t-rex wreaks havoc throughout the city there are blazing gun battles and buildingscardboard mock-upsblowing up but a single police car or the army nor anyone else ever shows up such activity must be commonplace in los angeleswe can only hope that a sequel isnt planned<SEP>0

awful this thriller should have buried what a piece of crap terrible writing characters are less than believable horrible schlock!! stick some b- stars in a terribly written pos to try and give it a little credit but it fails miserably if i didnt have to write ten lines about this movie i would have given it a word word review it starts with sh and ends with ithorrible ending retarded who writes this crap the ending of this film is so contrived weak its as if they had no idea what to do with this story line or they just ran out of money most likely due to the number of cameos in this movie its a good thing that these actors are on the way out because this would be a career killer good thing for them that hardly anyone will see it at least no one important like future investors it could have ended a thousand different ways but as it is i feel cheated out of my precious timedont bother with this one you will feel like you wasted time you can never get back<SEP>0

horror spoofs are not just a thing of the 21st century way before the scary movie series there were a few examples of this genre mostly in the 80s but like said franchise most of these films are hit or miss some like elvira mistress of the dark mostly rise above that but other like saturday the 14th and its sequel fail to deliver the laughs but out of all these types of films there is one particularly big offender and thats transylvania 6-5000 a major waste of time for many reasonspros: a great cast that does its best some of the dopey humor is amusing a corny but catch theme song some good transylvanian locationscons: threadbare plot mostly tedious pacing most of the humor just doesnt cut it the monsters are given little to do and little screen time i thought this was supposed to be a spoof of monster movies lame ending that will likely make viewers angryfinal thoughts: this is a comedy if it is then why are the really funny bits so few and far in between comedies are supposed to make us roll on the floor not roll our eyes and yawn aching for it to be over i cant believe anchor bay released this tired junk ill admit its not one of the worst films ever made but its not worth anyones time or money even if youre a fan of any of the actors see transylvania twist insteadmy rating: 25<SEP>0

cavemen was by far the biggest load of crap i have ever wasted my time watching this show based on the geico commercials is less entertaining then an actual 30 sec ad for geico the makeup was half ass-ed to say the least hard to imagine a caveman with prefect white teeth even after going to the dentist this show could of had potential for a funny series if they could of gotten the cast from the commercials that in it self makes for a lousy show perhaps if the writers were the same from the geico ads this may of had a chance instead the pilot lacked a good story line i give this show a 1 out of 10 i would of liked to put a zero out of 10 but that was not an option i pray for a quick death to this show id give it less then 5 episodes before it dies a deserving death<SEP>0

mario lanza of course is the great caruso in this 1951 film also starring ann blyth dorothy kirsten eduard franz and ludwig donath this is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary world-renowned tenor whose name is known even todaythe film is opulently produced and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by lanza kirsten judmila novotna blanche thebom and other opera stars who appeared in the film if youre a purist seeing people on stage smiling during the sextet from lucia will strike you as odd - even if carusos wife dorothy just had a baby girl also its highly unlikely that caruso ever sang edgardo in lucia; the role lay too high for himin taking dramatic license the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of carusos life what was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire yet this is never mentioned in the film these roles include maurizio in adriana lecouvreur and dick johnson in girl of the golden west there is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga the reason for that photo his only shirt was in the laundry he was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the victor talking-machine company later rca victor he was singing jose in carmen in san francisco the night of the earthquakeinstead the mgm story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of martha which never happened he had a hemorrhage during lelisir damore at the met and could not finish the performance; he only sang three more times at the met his last role as eleazar in la juive what killed him the same thing that killed valentino - peritonitis his first role at the met was not radames in aida as indicated in the film but the duke in rigoletto so when it says on the screen suggested by dorothy carusos biography of her husband thats what it was - suggested what is true is that dorothys father disowned her after her marriage and left her $1 of his massive estate they also did have a daughter gloria together who died at the age of 79 on 1072007 however caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married dorothysome people say that lanzas voice is remarkably like carusos but just listen to caruso sing in the film match point -- carusos voice is remarkably unlike lanzas in fact from his sound had he wanted to caruso could have sung as a baritone he is thought to have had some trouble with high notes further evidence of baritone leanings; and the role he was preparing when he died was othello a dramatic tenor role which lanza definitely was not lanzas voice deserved not to be compared with another he made a unique contribution to film history popularizing operatic music he sings the music in the great caruso with a robust energy; he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career his acting is natural and genuine ann blyth is lovely as dorothy and gets to sing a little herselfreally a film for opera lovers and lanza fans which are probably one and the same<SEP>1

first let me say that i am not a dukes fan but after this movie the series looked like law and order the worst thing was the casting of roscoe and boss hogg burt reynolds is not boss hogg and even worse was mc gainey as roscoe if they ever watched the show roscoe was not a hard ass cop he was more a barney fife than the role he played in this moviethe movie is loaded with the usual errors cars getting torn up and continues like nothing happened the worst example of this is when the the general gets together with billy prickett and the general is ran into a dirt hill obviously slowing to a near stop but goes on to win the race<SEP>0
i like this presentation - i have read bleak house and i know it is so difficult to present the entire book as it should be and even others like little dorrit - i have to admit they did a very good show with the staged nicholas nickelby i love diana rigg and i could see the pain of lady dedlock even through the expected arrogance of the aristocracy i am sorry i think she is the best lady dedlock i am not sure who could have made a better jarndyce but i am ok with mr elliott it is not easy to present these long dickens books - oliver twist would be easier - this is a long and if you dont care for all the legal situations can be dreary or boring i think this presentation is entertaining enough not to be boring i just loved mr smallweed - it can be entertaining there is always a child - jo will break your heart here i think we should be given a chance to judge for ourselvesi have to say i loved the show maybe if i read the book again as i usually do after seeing the movie maybe i can be more critical in the meantime - i think it is a good presentation<SEP>1
a somewhat typical bit of filmmaking from this era obviously it was first conceived into this world for the stage but nonetheless a very good film from beginning to end peter otoole and susannah york get to do their stage performance act for the silver screen and both do it effectively there is very little in the way of story and anyone not familiar with this type of off beat character study may be a little put off by it all in all though a good film in which peter otoole and susannah york get to overact<SEP>1
this film breeches the fine line between satire and silliness while a bridge system that has no rules may promote marital harmony it certainly cant promote winning bridge so the satire didnt work for me but there were some items i found enjoyable anyway especially with the big bridge match between paul lukas and ferdinand gottschalk near the end of the film it is treated like very much like a championship boxing match not only is the arena for the contest roped off in a square area like a boxing ring there is a referee hovering between the contestants and radio broadcaster roscoe karns delivers nonstop chatter on the happenings at one point he even enumerates one two three four as though a bid of four diamonds was a knockdown event and people were glued to their radios for it all a common event for championship boxing matches that spoof worked very well indeedunfortunately few of the actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire paul lukas doesnt have much of a flair for comedy and is miscast; lovely loretta young and the usual comic frank mchugh werent given good enough lines; glenda farrell has a nice comic turn as a forgetful blonde at the start of the film but she practically disappears thereafter what a waste of talent!<SEP>0
drss1942 really took the words right out of my mouth i loved segals early films and feel like the only one who is still faithful to him i just saw this movie ok fell asleep about 90% through so i didnt see the end when i woke up and saw i was at the dvd menu i was thankful i didnt subject myself to any more of that movie and didnt dare find out what happened at the end there was something strange about the voice of segal and others kinda reminded me of the original mad max where the voice were dubbed but in the same language australlian is english right : anyway if i had 10 thumbs theyd all point down right now for this segal injustice<SEP>0
yes this production is long good news for bronte fans! and it has a somewhat dated feel but both the casting and acting are so brilliant that you wont want to watch any other versions!timothy dalton is edward rochester its that simple i dont care that other reviewers claim hes too handsome dalton is attractive certainly but no pretty-boy in fact he possesses a craggy angular dark charm that in my mind is quite in keeping with the mysterious very masculine mr r and he takes on rochesters sad tortured persona so poignantly he portrays ferocity when the scene calls for it but also displays rochesters tender passionate emotional side as well imo the newer a&e production suffers in that ciaran hinds - whom i normally adore - seems to bluster and bully his way throughout ive read the book many times and i never felt that rochester was meant to be perceived as a nonstop snarling beastwhen i reread the novel i always see zelah clarke as jane ms clarke to me resembles jane as she describes herself and is described by others small childlike fairy though its true the actress doesnt look 18 she portrays janes attributes so well while other reviews have claimed that her acting is wooden or unemotional one must remember that the character spent 8 years at lowood being trained to hold her emotions and passionate nature in check her main inspiration was her childhood friend helen who was the picture of demure submission although her true nature was dissimilar jane learned to master her temper and appear docile in keeping with the schools aims for its charity students who would go into service jane becomes a governess in the household of the rich mr rochester she would certainly *not* speak to him as an equal even later on when she gave as well as she got she would always be sure to remember that her station was well below that of her employer nevertheless if you read the book - to which this production stays amazingly close - you can clearly see the small struggles zelah-as-jane endures as she subdues her emotions in order to remain mild and even-temperedthe chemistry between dalton and clarke is just right i think no it does not in the least resemble hollywood thank god! its not a hollywood sort of book but theirs is a romance which is true devoted and loyal and for a woman like jane who never presumed to have *any* love come her way it is a minor miraclethe rest of the casting is terrific and i love the fact that nearly every character from the book is present here so too is much of the rich poetic original dialogue this version is the only one that i know of to include the lovely infamous gypsy scene and in general features more humor than other versions ive seen in particular the mutual teasing between the lead characters comes straight from the book and is so delightful!jane eyre was in many ways one of the first novelized feminists she finally accepted love on her own terms and independently and at last as rochesters true equal just beautiful!<SEP>1
i watched this show and i simply didnt find it funny at all it might have been the first episode lately i realize abc is playing a lot of stupid shows nowadays and is going down as a station all the characters on this show are pretty bad actors but even if they were good the jokes and script are pretty horrible and would still bring the show down i would say that i believe this show will be cancelled but seeing as how abc is doing pretty horrible for quality of shows they are playing they might just keep this one simply because its average compared to them<SEP>0
but the rest of us who love a good sentimental and emotional story that is a lock to get you cryingenjoy! tom hulce is magnificent as dominick a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother eugene played by ray liotta who is a doctor and who works very long hours due to eugenes work schedule dominick is alone a lot of the time and tends to make questionable judgment calls he really just wants to be a good boy to do the right thing and to make his brother proud of him he stops in church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character has you crying before the damn movie even gets really started not about to give anything away here but the movie is extremely involving and sad and heartbreaking those unafraid of these things will have a field day with this beautiful story its loving characters and a great song i cannot quote here that has nothing to do with the movie at all but is strangely appropriatebut you hear it in a bari thought tom hulce would be nominated for this movie since he was for amadeus i figured that might give him the inside track to actually winning no such luck liotta is just as good but has less of an emotional impact but then he does later on all i can say about jamie lee curtis is that she doesnt have much of a part here but it was nice of her to lend her name to a small drama set in pittsburgh about two brothers who you will never forget<SEP>1
definitely not worth the rental but if you catch it on cable youll be pleasantly surprised by the cameos--imans appearance is especially self-deprecating its also an opportunity to watch all the male supporting cast members from the sopranos typecast themselves<SEP>0

vampyres aspect ratio: 185:1sound format: monoa motorist murray brown is lured to an isolated country house inhabited by two beautiful young women marianne morris and anulka and becomes enmeshed in their free-spirited sexual lifestyle but his hosts turn out to be vampires with a frenzied lust for human bloodtaking its cue from the lesbian vampire cycle initiated by maverick director jean rollin in france and consolidated by the success of hammers carmilla series in the uk jose ramon larraz daring shocker vampyres pushed the concept of adult horror much further than british censors were prepared to tolerate in 1974 and his film was cut by almost three minutes on its original british release it isnt difficult to see why! using its gothic theme as the pretext for as much nudity sex and bloodshed as the films short running time will allow larraz who wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym d daubeney uses these commercial elements as mere backdrop to a languid meditation on life death and the impulses - sexual and otherwise - which affirm the human conditionshot on location at a picturesque country house during the autumn of 1973 harry waxmans haunting cinematography conjures an atmosphere of grim foreboding in which the desolate countryside - bleak and beautiful in equal measure - seems to foreshadow a whirlwind of impending horror larraz pulled a similar trick earlier the same year with symptoms a low-key thriller which erupts into a frenzy of violence during the final reel however despite its pretensions vampyres wafer-thin plot and rough-hewn production values will divide audiences from the outset and while the two female protagonists are as charismatic and appealing as could be wished the male lead brown past his prime at the time of filming is woefully miscast in a role that should have gone to some beautiful twentysomething stud a must-see item for cult movie fans an amusing curio for everyone else vampyres is an acquired taste watch out for silent era superstar bessie love in a brief cameo at the end of the movie<SEP>0
canadians are too polite to boo but the audience at the toronto film festival left the theater muttering that they would rate this film 0 or 1 on their voting sheets the premise is that a modern filmmaker is interpreting a 17th century fable about the loves of shepherds and shepherdesses set in the distant past when druids were the spiritual leaders working in three epochs presents many opportunities to introduce anachronisms including silly and impractical clothing and peculiar spiritual rites that involve really bad poetry lovers are divided by jealousy and their rigid adherence to idiotic codes of conduct from which cross-dressing and assorted farcical situations arise the film could have been hilarious as a monty python piece which it too closely resembles but rohmers effort falls very flat the audience laughed at the sight jokes but otherwise bemoaned the slow pace the ending comes all in a rush and is truly awful this is a trivial film and a waste of your movie going time<SEP>0
i was totally impressed by shelley adriennes waitress 2007 this movie only confirms what was clear from that movie adrienne was a marvelously talented writer-director an original and unique artist she managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanistic tendency ally sheedy steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge male lead reg rodgers looking like judd nelson is fine there is also a great cameo by ben vereen the song at the end of the movie the bastard song written by adrienne can stand as her optimistic eulogy: its a world of sufferingin a sea of painno matter how much sun you bringyoure pummeled by the raindont let the heartless get you downdont greet the heartless at your doordont live among the heartless<SEP>1
bad script bad direction over the top performances overwrought dialogue what more could you ask for for laughs it just doesnt get any better than this zadoras over-acting combined with the cliched scenarios she finds herself in make for an hilarious parody of the hollywood machine almost as funny as spinal tap even though it was clearly not intended as such dont miss ray liottas debut film line looks like a penis<SEP>1
this has to be one of the best comedies on the television at the moment it takes the sugary-sweet idea of a show revolving around a close family and turns it into a quite realistic yet funny depiction of a typical family complete with sibling and parent spats brat brothers over-protective fathers and bimbo sisters im almost surprised its disney!to its credit 8 simple rules knows its a comedy and doesnt try to be more too many shows eg sister sister and lizzie mcguire think just because its lead characters are now teenagers then they should tackle social issues and end up losing their humour by being too hard-hitting this is a trap 8 simple rules has avoided; it does tackle some issues such as being the school outcast but it has fun while doing so in fact the only time it has really been serious was understandably when it sensitively handled the tragic death of john ritter and his characterand i think although john ritter will be sadly missed since he was the reason the show made its mark 8 simple rules can still do well if it remembers its humour and doesnt make cates father a second version of paul hennessy<SEP>1
well it looked good on papernick cage and jerry buckheimer collaborate again this time on a mix of heist movie da vinci codeamerican history 101 and indiana jones but oh dear this is to indiana jones what speed 2 is to speed a reasonable castincluding john voight and harvey keitel battles against a puerile script and loses badly the film is little more than an extended advert for the freemasonshowever these freemasons are not your usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf these freemasons are the natural descendants of the knights templar and nobody mention from hell or jack the ripperi dont think ive revealed any plot spoilers because there are none there is virtually no suspense no surprises and no climax- it just stops national treasure aims for dan brown but hits the same intellectual level as an episode of scooby doo sans the humour<SEP>0
over the years weve seen a lot of preposterous things done by writers when the show just had to go on no matter what keeping 8 simple rules going after john ritter died comes to mind but this is probably the first time i cared the idea of having that 70s show without eric or to a lesser extent kelso is ridiculous they tried to cover it up with a comeback of leo and increasingly outrageous story lines but it always felt like why bother when you dont have a main character anymore it just didnt really connect it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time wasnt even funny the last season felt like the season too much for every single character simply because eric used to take a lot of screen time and now wed be smashed in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were focusing on the gimmick that is fez was thoroughly uninteresting and the character would simply stop working because the whole deal was that hed say something weird from out of nowhere and you cant say stuff from out of nowhere when every second line is yours they also brought in the standard cousin oliver only this time it just wasnt a kid whenever you heard somebody knock on the door you started praying it wasnt randy please let it not be randy the deal with randy was that hed do really awful jokes usually as red would say smiling like an ass and totally screwing up delivery and donna would be in stitches i think more than half of the last season was donna pretending to be amused the problems had started earlier though: what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept that for once wasnt about a dysfunctional family slowly got into the territory of soap opera everybody started being in love with everybody emotional scenes were dragged out at nausea with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to divert attention that we were watching as the world turns im guessing this was character development but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from family matters to be fair the last episode also because it had a cameo by topher grace a cameo in his own show was really good even if not that funny eitherby the way yet more criticism on season 8: what the hell was with the opening theme not only did they use the same joke twice a character not singing fez scared the hell out of me dude dont open your eyes that far but the first five seasons or soamong the best comedy ever broadcast<SEP>1

flat out the funniest spoof of pretentious art house films ever madethis flick exposes all the clichés and then some! excruciatingly bad downs-syndrome! actors terribly heavy self important dialog scenes that are supposed to shock but fall flat jarring editing pointless plot points all wrapped up in a kind of smirky miasma of disrespect for the audience and vague psych-drivelit achieves exactly what it was designed to a hilarious satire of those tedious movies made by spoiled teenage trust-funders to show to their parents when they ask them what theyve been doing for the last two years! after what is it received its cannes award presenter werner herzog was rumored to have been told that the film was in fact a spoof in part of his own films! he supposedly blew up at the info to this day he refuses to discuss the incidentanyway see it and laugh this will be a classic of humor for many years to come<SEP>1
this is a very fine and poetic story beautiful scenery magnificent music score ive been twice in japan last year and the movie gave me this typical japanese feeling the movement of the camera is superb as well as the actors it goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic japanese people are very sensitive and kind and its all very well brought onto the screen here the director is playing superb with light an colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details once youve seen this movie you will want to see more from the same director its a real feel good movie and i can only recommend it to everybody<SEP>1
daniel day lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites it is amazing how much he throws himself in each of the characters he plays making them reali remember many years ago we had a party in our house - the friends came over we were sitting around the table eating drinking the wine talking laughing - having a good time the tv was on - there was a movie which we did not pay much attention to then suddenly all of us stopped talking and laughing the glasses did not clink the forks did not move the food was getting cold on the plates we could not take our eyes off the screen where the young crippled man whose entire body was against him and who only had a control over his left foot picked up a piece of chalk with his foot and for what seemed the eternity tried to write just one word on the floor when he finished writing that one word we all knew that we had witnessed not one but three triumphs - the triumph of a human will and spirit the triumph of the cinema which was able to capture the moment like this on the film and the triumph of an actor who did not act but who became his characterjim sheridans my left foot is an riveting unsentimental bio-drama about christy brown the man who was born with cerebral palsy in a dublin slum; who became an artist and a writer and who found a love of his lifei like every one of day lewiss performances i have mixed feelings about his performance in gony but i believe that his greatest role was christy brown in my left foot<SEP>1
kenneth branagh attempts to turn william shakspeares obscure rarely-produced comedy into a 1930s-era musical with the result being both bad shakespeare and bad musical comedy as the actors are rarely adept at one or the other of the two styles and in some cases flounder badly in both particularly painful is nathan lane who seems to be under the impression that he is absolutely hysterical as costard but is badly mistaken and alicia silverstone who handles the shakespearean language with all the authority of a teenaged valley girl who is reading the script aloud in her middle school english classthe musical numbers are staged with the expertise of a high school production of dames at sea leaving the cast looking awkward and amateurish while singing and dancing with the lone exception being adrian lester who proves himself a splendid song and dance man the only other saving grace of the film are natascha mcelhone and emily mortimers contribution as eye candy but they have given far better performances than in this film and youd be wise to check out some of the other titles in their filmographies and gives this witless mess a pass<SEP>0
what to say about this movie well it is about a bunch of good students who have some bad drugs and turn into delinquent students that sell more of the bad drugs to people two of those people have adverse effects as one turns into a toxic avenger type and his girlfriend throws up some creature that grows in the schools basement that is about all there is to it and they stretch it out for 84 minutes this movie is pretty bad and should be locked away forever though that is not fair some people like tromas movies and they can watch it if they want troma movies for me though are the worst movies there are out there i just watched this one out of morbid curiosity<SEP>0
carlo verdone once managed to combine superb comedy with smart and subtle social analysis and criticismthen something happened and he turned into just another dull holier-than-thou directoril mio miglior nemico can more or less be summarized in one line working class = kind and warm while upper-class = snob and devious but love wins in the endsuch a trite clichè for such a smart directorthere isnt really too much to talk about in the movie every character is a walking stereotype: the self-made-man who forgets his roots but wholl become good again the scorned wife the rebellious rich girl who falls for the honest-but-poor guy acting is barely averageseverely disappointing under every aspect<SEP>0
stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so i am happy to see any of their films professor noodle lucien littlefield is nearing the completion of his rejuvenation formula with the ability to reverse ageing after twenty years ollie and stan are the chimney sweeps that arrive to do their job and very quickly ollie wants to get away from stan making mistakes ollie goes to the roof to help with the other end of the brush at the top of the chimney but stan in the living room ends up pushing the him back in the attic after breaking an extension stan gets a replacement a loaded gun from off the wall and of course it fires the brush off stan goes up to have a look and ollie standing on the attic door of the roof falls into the greenhouse stan asks if he was hurt and ollie only answers with i have nothing to say ollie gets back on the roof and he and stan end up in a tug and pull squabble which ends up in ollie falling down and destroying the chimney ollie hatless in the fireplace is hit on the head by many bricks coming down and the butler jessup sam adams is covered in chimney ash smoke oh and ollie still has nothing to say to stan the boys decide to clean up the mess and when stan tears the carpet with the shovel ollie asks cant you do anything right and stan replies i have nothing to say getting the shovel bashed on his head as ollie holds a bag for stan to shovel in the ashes they get distracted by a painting on the wall and the ashes end up down ollies trousers so stan gets another shovel bashed on the head professor noodle finishes his formula and does a final test on a duck with a drop in a tank of water changing it into a duckling he also shows the boys his success turning the duckling into an egg and he next proposes to use a human subject ie his butler while hes gone the boys decide to test the formula for themselves but ollie ends up being knocked by stan into the water tank with all the formula in the end what was once ollie comes out an ape and when stan asks him to speak all ollie ape says is i have nothing to say and stan whimpers filled with wonderful slapstick and all classic comedy you could want from a black and white film it is an enjoyable film stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians comedian very good!<SEP>1

i saw this movie when i was in israel for the summer my hebrew is not fluent so the subtitles were very useful i didnt feel lost at any point in the movie you tend to get used to subtitles after about 5 minutesthis movie blew me away!!!!!! it depicts two of the most prominent taboos in the middle east today: a homosexual relationship between an israeli and a palestinian it allows a person to enter both realms of the conflict simultaneously the dilemma the emotions entailed the movie climaxes in tragedy when anger and rage drive one of the lovers to one extremist side! an absolute must see!!<SEP>1
i had never heard of larry fessenden before but judging by this effort into writing and directing he should keep his day job as a journeyman actor like many others on here i dont know how to categorize this film it wasnt scary or spooky so cant be called a horror the plot was so wafer thin it cant be a drama there was no suspense so it cant be a thriller its just a bad film that you should only see if you were a fan of the blair witch project people who liked this film used words like ambiguity and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that wasnt there like the blair witch people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that it was terrifying this movie actually started off well with the family meeting the locals after hitting a deer it looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next 45 minutes well over half the film nothing happened the family potted about their holiday home which was all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining it was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie finally when something does happen its not even clear how the father was shot how he dies the nurse said his liver was only grazed and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with 3rd grade special effects the film is called wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way the film ends all muddled and leaves you very unsatisfied i would have bailed out with 15 minutes to go but i wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself it didnt<SEP>0
i always thought this would be a long and boring talking-heads flick full of static interior takes dude i was wrong election is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller-drama taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of triads-rituals characters are constantly on the move and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider its still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters furthermore johnnie to succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light-shadow contrasts although theres hardly any action the ending is still shocking in its ruthless depicting of brutality cool movie that deserves more attention and i came to like the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit<SEP>1
delightful film directed by some of the best directors in the industry today the film is also casting some of the great actors of our time not just from france but from everywheremy favorite segments:14th arrondissement: carol margo martindale from denver comes to paris to learn french and also to make a sense of her lifemontmartre: there was probably not a better way to start this movie than with this segment on romantic parisloin du 16ème: an image of paris that we are better aware of since the riots in the cités ana catalina sandino moreno spends more time taking care of somebody elses kid shes a nanny than of her ownquartier latin: so much fun to see gérard depardieu as the tenancier de bar with gena rowlands and ben gazzara discussing their divorcetour eiffel: dont tell me you didnt like those mimes!tuileries: such a treat to see steve buscemi as the tourist whos making high-contact a no- no with a girl in the metroparc monceau: nick nolte is great ludivine sagnier alsoive spend 3 days in paris in 2004 and this movie makes me want to go back!seen in barcelona another great city at the verdi on march 18th 200784100 ***<SEP>1
this movie was kind of interestingi had to watch it for a college class about india however the synopsis tells you this movie is about one thing when it doesnt really contain much cold hard information on those details it is not really true to the synopsis until the very end where they sloppily try to tie all the elements together the gore factor is superb however even right at the very beginning you want to look away because the gore is pretty intense only watch this movie if you want to see some cool gore because the plot is thin and will make you sad that you wasted time listening to it ive seen rumors on other websites about this movie being based on true events however you can not find any information about it onlineso basically this movie was a waste of time to watch<SEP>0
this movie surprised me some things were clicheish and some technological elements reminded me of the movie enemy of the state starring will smith but for the most part very entertaining- good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the 2 wannabe thugs julio and ramundo providing some comic relief this is a movie you can watch over again-say some wednesday night when nothing else is on i gave it a 9 for entertainment value<SEP>1
this is my kind of film i am fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares and this movie is just that but it is also a dark comedy while i see it mostly as a horrorthriller there will be others who might see it as a black dramatic comedybut either way it is a fascinating descent into madness the ending caught me off guard but what an ending! it leaves the viewer a lot to think aboutpowerful performances a complex and detailed plot a great script filled with dread and dashes of humor and an eerie atmosphere make this a film worth watchingpersonally i think that i will need to watch this several more times to pick up and understand all the subtleties that are within but it is such a film that it will be a pleasure and not a chore so to do<SEP>1
lloyd bridges as mike nelson and his boat were all the stars of this series what made it so good to me when i watched it was the real feel of going underwater the show exhibits a youthful energy energy for exploration under water which is infectiousthe show was educational as well showing the viewer things about scuba diving from someone who appeared to be a consummate pro mike nelson there were excellent shows and the program always appeared to be well produced granted the drama in the scripts sometimes hit the same notes in more than 1 episode but each show holds its own with any other show produced during this era the infancy of american television<SEP>1
sometimes you need to see a bad movie just to appreciate the good ones well thats my opinion anyway this one will always be in the bad movie category simply because all but shu qis performance was terriblemartial angel tells of cat shu qi a professional thief turned straight after leaving her lover chi lam julian cheung two years before but her past returns to haunt her as chi lam is kidnapped for the ransom of security software belonging to the company cat works for in order to rescue him she calls on her old friends from her orphanage days six other feisty women to save the dayi may have told the synopsis cheesily but this is a cheesy story in fact the whole script and direction lacked any quality at all much of the dialogue was meaningless and coupled with a plot that was as thin as rice-paper in water if i could sum it up take a bad jackie chan movie remove the comedy remove the choreography throw away the budget and you have martial angels: a formulaic piece of work with no imagination at allmind you i do have to give credit where credits due and shu qi was probably the only person to emerge unscathed from the terrible action as it was her performance that shone through okay you cant say she was excellent - after all she had absolutely nothing to work with - but she did manage to dig some character out from her role other than that only sandra ng and kelly lin made any other impression - although these were mostly glimmers and very briefelsewhere the film just fell to pieces scenes and dialogue were completely unnatural and unbelievable special effects were obviously done on the cheap with no attempt to clean up edges between persons and the mask of the blue screen poor editing involving numerous discontinuities in fight scenes camera angles that were elementary and unflattering and direction ive seen better from a lost dogi guess this film was a too many cooks affair most probably the budget was blown away on the over-enthusiasm to have seven babes on the same silver screen that didnt leave much elsefrankly the way this film was made was like a cheap porn movie without the porn charlies angels it aint in fact while sisters can do it for themselves none of that was really that apparent heredefinitely one to forget<SEP>0
after a lively if predictable opening bank-heist scene set it off plummets straight into the gutter and continues to sink this is a movie that deals in nasty threadbare stereotypes instead of characters preposterous manipulation instead of coherent plotting and a hideous cocktail of cloying sentimentality and gratuitous violence instead of thought wit or feeling in short its no different from 90% of hollywood product but its the racial angle that makes set it off a particularly saddening example of contemporary film-making posing as a celebration of sistahood the film is actually a celebration of the most virulent forms of denigrating afican-american gangsta stereotype the gimmick this time is that the gangstas are wearing drag not only does the film suggest that gangsterism is a default identity for all african americans strapped for cash or feeling a bit hassled by the man it presents its sistas as shallow materialists who prize money and bling above all else worse set it off exploits the theme of racial discrimination and disadvantage simply as a device to prop up its feeble plot structure serious race-related social issues are wheeled on in contrived and opportunistic fashion in order to justify armed robbery then theyre ditched as soon as the film has to produce the inevitably conventional ending in which crime is punished the lapd turns out to be a bunch of caring guilt-ridden liberals tell that to rodney king and aspirational good sista jada pinkett smith follows the path of upward mobility out of the hood and into a world of middle-class self-indulgence opened up for her by her buppie bank-manager boyfriend set it off illustrates the abysmal state of the contemporary blaxploitation film pandering to mindless gangsta stereotypes and pretending to celebrate life in the hood while all the time despising it while the likes of shaft and superfly in the 1970s might have peddled stereotypes and rehashed well-worn plots they had a freshness an energy and an innocence that struck a chord with audiences of all races and still makes them fun to watch set it off wouldnt be worth getting angry over if wasnt a symptom of the tragic decline and ghettoisation of african-american film-making since the promising breakthrough days of the early 1990s<SEP>0
i thought the racism and prejudice against carl brashear was grossly overdramatized for hollywood effect i do not believe the u s navy was ever that overtly racist i cannot imagine a full captain the commanding officer ever telling his chief to intentionally flunk anyone certainly not at the risk of his life and there has never been a chief petty officer as unabashedly prejudice against everybody but wasps as deniros character no chief as slovenly and drunken as he was played would have ever risen to master chief in the first place cuba gooding saved an otherwise badly done movie<SEP>1
after seeing midnight offerings i am still convinced that the first decent movie about teenage witches yet has to be made i didnt think much of the craft and im not into charmed either the only film i more or less enjoyed about teenage witches was little witches 1996 and even that one wasnt very good but changes are that if you liked all the aforementioned movies you will also enjoy midnight offeringsi was expecting a silly and cheesy early 80s movie about teenage witches in high school but i was rather surprised that this whole movie plays it rather serious the acting is decent and serious all the time no jokes are being played by teenagers or something and the musical score at first i thought was pretty good it added some scariness and also something classy with the use of threatening violins and all but as the movie progressed i came to the conclusion that the score was just too ambitious they didnt have to add those threatening violins when you simply see someone back up a car and then drive away at normal speedthen theres melissa sue anderson who was the main reason for me to see this movie a few weeks ago i saw her in happy birthday to me a rather enjoyable thick-plotted and goofy on some occasions slasher-movie which she had done in the same year as midnight offerings and i must say she was very good as the icy-cold bad witch vivian but the main problem with the movie is: almost nothing happens! vivian causes a death and an accident yes but thats it then theres robin the good witch who is just learning about her powers and we expect the two of them using their powers more than once but at only one occasion they use their powers to make some pieces of wood and other stuff fly through the air as projectiles that was supposed to be a fight between two powerful witches and whats worse i was hoping to see a spectacular show-down between the witches at the end of the movie with at least some special effects flaming eyes or whatever but nothing happens there is sort of a confrontation in the end but its a big disappointmentso the acting of the two witches was good the musical score was decent even though overly ambitious and the cinematography was rather dark and moody at times but that doesnt make a good movie yet does it<SEP>0
kazans early film noir won an oscar some of the reviews here go into extraordinary detail and length about the film and its symbolism and rate it very highly i can almost see where they are coming from but i prefer to take a more toned-down approach to a long-forgotten film that appears to have been shot on practically no budget and in quasi-documentary fashion pneumonic plague is loose in the streets of new orleans and it is up to a military doctor widmark and a city detective douglas to apprehend the main carrier palance the film is moody shot in stark black and white and makes very good use of locations widmark is wonderful as usual forget the symbolism crime equals disease and disease equals crime and just enjoy the chase it is not always easy watching a film like this now that we are well into this new century as it is of a particular style that was very short-lived post wwii through the early 1950s and will unlikely be of interest to the casual film watcher for those who will be watching this for the first time sit tight for the big chase at the end it is something else and frankly i dont know how they filmed some of it i can say it probably took as long to film the finale as it did the first 90 percent of the movie<SEP>1
theres a legion of mick garris haters out there who feel he couldnt direct a horror film of quality if he had to and sleepwalkersscreenplay written by stephen kingis often used as an example of this i like sleepwalkers though i fully am aware that garris just says f#ck it and lets all hell break loose about fifteen or so minutes into the movie forget character or plot development who needs them anyway its about violent mayhem and bloody carnage as a mother and son pair of sleepwalkersfeline-human shapeshifting creatures who suck the lifeforce from virginal female innocents moving from town to town living a nomadic existence truly powerfulset their sights on a teenager who doesnt surrender without a fight before all is said and done many will be slaughtered as a mother shant tolerate the possible death of her beloved songarris wastes little time setting up those to be executed as a teacherglenn shadix suspecting handsome all american charmer charles bradybrian krauseto be someone entirely different from who he claims gets his hand ripped off and his neck torn into charles lures pretty virgins into his arms drawing their energy in turn feeding his hungry mama maryalice krige the fresh new target is tanya robertsonmädchen amick and she seems to be easy pickens but this will not be the case and when charles is seriously injured in a strugglethanks to a deputys cat clovis marys vengeance will be reaped on all those who get her way mary come hell or high water will retrieve tanya in the goal of refreshing her dying sonlike many teenagers i had a crush on certain actresses i watched in movies such as amy dolenz i was smitten with mädchen amick shes simply adorable in this movie and i love how she bites her lower lip displaying an obvious attraction towards charles unaware of his ulterior motives i just knew that mädchen amick would be destined to be a scream queen but this would never be the case too bad because i wouldve welcomed her in the genre with open armskrige is yummy as the menacing damn sexy but vicious and mean bitch who wipes out an entire police force and poor tanyas parents in one fail swoop in less than ten or so minutes she stabs one in the back with a corn cob! she bites the fingers off of poor ron perlman before cracking his arma bone protruding knocking him unconscious with his own elbow! she tosses tanyas mom through a window after breaking a rose vase over her fathers face! a deputy is stabbed in his ear by charlescop-kebab! falling on the pencil for extra impact poor tanya is dragged by her hair from her home by mary driven to the brady home and forced into an impromptu dance with the crippled monster! the sheriff is hurled onto a picket fence and we see how cats combat the sleepwalkers unlike humans we see mary and charles abilities to dim themselves and his car using a power of invisibility writer stephen king even finds time to include himself and horror director buddies of his in a crime scene sequence with clive barker and tobe hooper as forensics officers joe dante and john landis as photograph expertsthe film is shot in a tongue-in-cheek let-it-all-hang-out manner with music appropriately hammering this technique home its about the ultra-violence simple as that with some deranged behavior and jet black humor complimenting garris direction and kings screenplay the incestuous angle of the sleepwalkers is a bit jarring and in-your-face without a lick of complexity this is closer in vein to kings own demented maximimum overdrive than his more serious works<SEP>1
origins of the care bears & their cousins if you saw the original film youll notice a discrepancy the cousins are raised with the care bears rather than meeting them later however i have no problems with that preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations the babies are adorable and its fun watching them play and grow my favourite is swift heart rabbit the villain is a delightfully menacing shapeshifter i could empathise with the three children since i was never good at sports either cree summer is excellent as christy the songs are sweet and memorable if you have an open heart love the toys or enjoyed the original this is not to be missed 910<SEP>1
i bought this film on dvd so i could get an episode of mystery science theater 3000 thankfully mike crow and tom servo are watchable because the film itself is not although there is a plot a story one can follow and a few actors that can act there isnt anything else the movie was so boring i have firmly confirmed that i will never watch it again without tom crow and mike as summarized above however it was better than the film featured in the mst3k episode that preceded it; mitchell<SEP>0
pickup on south street is a high speed drama about a small time criminal who suddenly finds himself embroiled in the activities of a group of communists the action is presented in a very direct and dynamic style and the momentum is kept up by means of some brilliant editing the use of a wide variety of different camera angles and effective close-ups also contribute to the overall impression of constant motion and vitality samuel fullers style of directing and the cinematography by joseph macdonald are excellent and there are many scenes which through their composition and lighting produce a strong sense of mood and atmosphereace pickpocket and repeat offender skip mccoy richard widmark gets into deep water when he steals a wallet from a young woman named candy jean peters on the new york subway she was being used by her ex-boyfriend joey richard kiley to make a delivery to one of his contacts in a communist organisation and unknown to her she was carrying us government secrets recorded on microfilm two fbi agents had been following candy and witnessed the theft one of the agents continues to tail her back to joeys apartment and the other zara willis bouchey visits police captain dan tiger murvyn vye zara explains that the fbi has been following candy for some months as part of their pursuit of the ringleader of a communist groupin order to identify the pickpocket tiger calls in a stoolie called moe thelma ritter who after being given a precise description of the cannons method of working makes a list of eight possible suspects once tiger sees skips name on the list hes immediately convinced that hes the man that they need to track down and he sends two detectives to arrest him when skip is brought into tigers office zara tells him about the microfilm and tiger offers to drop any charges if hell co-operate with the investigation skip is flippant and arrogant he clearly doesnt trust tiger and denies all knowledge of the theft on the subwayjoey orders candy to find out who stole the microfilm and then retrieve it candy pays moe for skips address and when skip returns from being questioned by tiger he finds candy searching his home and knocks her unconscious before stealing her money when she recovers skip demands payment of $25000 for the microfilm she tells joey about skips demand and joeys boss gives him a gun and orders him to recover the microfilm by the following eveningskip and candy are attracted to each other and its because of their uneasy developing relationship that a means evolves by which they are able to shake off the attentions of the police it soon becomes apparent however that resolving matters with the communist gang will only be achieved by more direct actionthe depictions of skip candy and moe as characters that inhabit a seedy world in which they are forced to face considerable risks on a daily basis are powerful and compellingmoes work as a police informer is dependent on her knowledge of the people in her community but also those people know what she does and any one of them could seek their revenge at any time she appears to be cunning and streetwise but also has her vulnerable side as she describes herself as an old clock running down and saves money to be able to have a decent burial in an exclusive cemetery in long island her belief that every buck has a meaning of its own leads her to sell any information regardless of danger friendships or principles and yet there is one occasion where she refuses and this proves fatal thelma ritters performance certainly merited the oscar nomination she earned for her roleskip is a violent criminal with no concern for his victims and having already been convicted three times in the past lives under the constant threat of being jailed for life if convicted again despite this he still continues with his criminal activities and strangely is merely philosophical when moe betrays his whereabouts and then later he even ensures that moe receives the type of burial she valued so highly candy is an ex-hooker and someone whose activities constantly put her in peril but behind her hardened exterior a warmer side gradually becomes more evident widmark and peters are both perfect for their roles and like ritter portray the different facets of their personalities with great style and conviction<SEP>1
ive been largely convinced to write this review for a number of reasons:1 this is without doubt the worst film ive ever seen 2 unless it gets more reviews it will not be listed in the all time worst films list - which it deserves to be 3 i was kinda lucky - i paid five pound for it ive seen it in shops for 15 pound don not pay that much for this film! you will be very angry 4 there are a lot of films out there in the horror genre that are not given a fair rating in my opinion and giving this film a higher rating than them is criminalthe plot summary: a guy with no friends meets a tramp who promises the world - well the magic ability to appear to everybody else like somebody else our hero cunningly turns into a teenage girl and joins their gang - sitting on swings baby-sitting he kills them one by one until he is tracked and found by the policewhy is it so bad to begin with the acting is very very bad someone else compared it to a school production no this is worse than any acting ive seen on a school stageive bought a number of these previously banned films from the dvd company vipco and not been as disappointed as i was at this okay the acting is bad but the film fails to deliver in every other sense what was the point in making this film when there isnt even any gore! okay no gore what else can a film like this offer breats no not even any titillation!its true this film may have a certain charm in its unique naffness but any potential buyerwatcher of this film should be fairly advised that this film is at best worth only one out of ten<SEP>0
the memory banks of most of the reviewers here mustve short-circuited when trying to recall this cubic zirconia of a gem because practically everyone managed to misquote lloyd bochners walter thornton when in a fit of peevish anger he hurls the phallic garden nozzle at his new wife jerilee randall-thornton a nearly comatose pia zadora which was used to sexually assault her earlier in the moviebut im getting ahead of myself in any case poor lloyd couldve been snarling that line at the speechless audience as much as he was his put-upon co-starhard as it is for most of us to believe especially these days nobody in hollywood sets out to intentionally make a bad movie this is certainly not the most defensible argument to make since there just seem to be so damn many of them coming out but then again there is that breed of film that one must imagine during the time of its creation from writing casting and direction mustve been cursed with the cinematic equivalent of trying to shoot during the ides of marchthe lonely lady is in that category and represents itself very well considering the circumstances here we have all the ingredients in a recipe guaranteed to produce a monumentally fallen soufflé: pia zadora a marginal singeractress so determined to be taken seriously that she would take on practically anything that might set her apart from her peers which this movie most certainly did!; a somewhat high-profile novel written by the trashmaster himself harold robbins of the carpetbaggers and dreams die first fame; a cast who probably thought they were so fortunate to be working at all that they tried to play this dreck like it was clifford odets or ibsen; plus a director who more than likely was a hired gun who kept the mess moving just to collect a paycheck and was probably contractually obligated not to demand the use of the alan smithee moniker to protect what was left of his reputation like lamont johnsons lipstick meir zarchis i spit on your grave roger vadims barbarella paul verhoevens showgirls or the grandmammy of really bad film-making frank perrys mommy dearest the lonely lady is still often-discussed usually with disgust disbelief horrified laughter or a unique combination of all three yet also defies dissection description or even the pretzel logic of hollyweird nobodys sure how it came to be how it was ever released in even a single theater or why its still here and nearly impossible to get rid of but take it or leave it it is here to stay and i dont think that lovers of really good bad movies would have it any other way<SEP>0
mighty morphin power rangers has got to be the worst television show ever made there is no plot just a bunch of silly costumed kids using martial arts while dressed up in second class spandex outfitsthe special effects look like they are from the 70s the costumes look like something out of a bad comedy and the show is just plain awfulthe only thing worse than the television show are the toys just second rate plastic garbage fed to our kidsthere are far better shows for your kids to watch!try giving your kids something like nickelodean those shows actually have some intelligence behind them unlike power rangers<SEP>0
mae clarke will always be remembered as the girl whose face james cagney showed a grapefruit into in the same years the public enemy she will not be remembered for this weird little story about a a hoods girl who finds that her past will always be with herin some ways this looks a bit antique for 1931 almost as if you are looking at 1928s famously inert lights of new york but dont be fooled although ted tetzlaffs photography is still in the big scenes theres lots of movement indicating distraction to the moviegoers in the set-ups to them but in competition with the fast-paced stuff that it seems that everyone was doing at warners this attempt to bring the womans viewpoint into the genre as a tearjerker doesnt work nor is mae clarke the actress to carry the effort<SEP>0
mario lewis of the competitive enterprise institute has written a definitive 120-page point-by-point line-by-line refutation of this mendacious film which should be titled a convenient lie the website address where his debunking report which is titled a skeptics guide to an inconvenient truth can be found at is :wwwceiorg a shorter 10-page version can be found at: wwwceiorgpdf5539pdf once you read those demolitions youll realize that alleged global warming is no more real or dangerous than the y2k scare of 1999 which gore also endorsed as he did the pseudo-scientific film the day after tomorrow which was based on a book written by alleged ufo abductee whitley strieber as james the amazing randi does to psychics and philip klass does to ufos and gerald posner does to jfk conspir-idiocy theories so does mario lewis does to al gores movie and the whole global warming scam<SEP>0
the funny sound that you may hear when you eyeball this execrable version of jules vernes classic journey to the center of the earth is verne spinning in his grave the only thing about this 80 minute opus that has anything to do with journey to the center of the earth is the title otherwise everything else in this lackluster production is new and not worth watching in fact the director has written here at imdbcom that he directed only eight minutes of journey to the center of the earth and the studio tacked on part of dollman helmer albert pyuns sequel to his own alien from la with kathy ireland evidently the producers ran out of money and to satisfy overseas contractual obligations they grafted pyuns sequel onto director rusty lemorandes movie please dont rent or buy this wretched piece of garbageunlike director henry levins period piece journey to the center of the earth 1959 with james mason and pat boone lemorandes journey to the center of the earth takes place in contemporary times in hawaii two fellows a british nanny and a dog are brought together for the adventure of a lifetime purely by coincidence richard paul carafotes of blind date and his comic book obsessed brother bryan ilan mitchell-smith of weird science are going out to explore a cave the heroine crystina nicola cowper of underworld works for a domestic service called nannies r us being a nanny has been crystinas life-long dream but she has made a less of all five of her nanny jobs nevertheless her sympathetic supervisor ms ferry lynda marshall of africa express sends her to hawaii crystinas new client rock star billy foul jeremy crutchley of doomsday who is scheduling one last concert to revive his flagging career has a dog named bernard foul wants crystina to take bernard to a doggie day spa crystina is waiting on the arrival of her taxi when a careless motel attendant accidentally puts the basket that conceals bernard in richards jeep you see foul has hidden his canine in a basket because motel management strictly prohibits pets on their premises foul has disguised the dog as a human baby anyway crystina catches a cab and tells the driver follow richardafter she catches up with them to get her dog the cabbie cruises away and abandons her crystina demands that richard drive her back to town but he has other plans unhappily crystina joins the guys and they get lost and then find themselves in the lost city of atlantis a police state ruled by a dictator at the center of the earth the rulers of atlantis repeatedly notify their citizens that life on the surface does not exist our heroes and heroine stumble onto atlantis quite by accident atlantis resembles a disco and everybody looks like they are straight out of a punk rock opera the ruler of atlantis general rykov janet du plessis of operation hit squad is orchestrating a raid on the surface with clones of the first human wanda saknussemm kathy ireland of necessary roughness to visit atlantis predictably general rykov machinations to rule atlantis and overthrow the earth fails and our heroes and heroine save the dayjourney to the center of the earth is an abomination the movie seems to be a comedy despite its superficial satire about dictatorships albert pyun is one of my favorite low budget action directors but he blew it on this lightweight shambles of a science fiction saga<SEP>0
one of the finest films ever made! why it only got a 76 rating is a mystery this film is a window into the world of the black experience in america should be mandatory viewing for all white people and all children above age 10 i recommend watching it with the long walk home as a companion piece if you think whoopi goldbergs work is about homer and eddie or hollywood squares think again dont miss this movie which should have won the oscar and read the book too!<SEP>1
this film enhanced my opinion of errol flynn while flynn is of course best known for his savoir-faire and sprezzatura to throw in a couple of high-falutin european terms! this film gives him an opportunity to stretch albeit only slightly as an actor as he plays an unabashed social climber with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match the supporting cast is excellent; everyone seems well-chosen for their rolesthe story moves briskly and while not particularly profound it misses perhaps intentionally the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time it certainly entertains and satisfies from what i know of jim corbett the story is also reasonably faithful to history i also really liked the great depictions of 1880s san francisco all in all theres little not to like about this filmvery well worth the time to watch it<SEP>1
the beaver trilogy is without a doubt one of the most brilliant films ever made i was lucky enough to catch it along with a q&a session with director trent harris at the ny video festival a few years back and then bought a copy off of trents website this movie has to be seen to be believed! i sincerely recommend searching for trents name on the web and then buying the film from his site hes an incredibly nice guy to boot dont get confused: the cameraman in the fictional sections of the beaver trilogy is not trent!after having seen the trilogy a few times i do have to admit that i could probably do without the sean penn version its like a try-out version for the crispin glover orkly kid section and is interesting more as a curiosity item if youre a penn fan than it being a good video penn is pretty funny though and you can see the makings of a big star in this gritty b&w videothis is probably also one of crispin glovers best roles and i would just love to see an updated documentary about the original groovin gary once you see this film youll never get garys nervous laughter out of your head ever again<SEP>1
this is my favorite of the older tom & jerry cartoons from the early 40s the original version with mammy two shoes is on the tom & jerry spotlight collection 2 set disc one and showcases the wonderful detailed animation of the early cartoons the gags on this one arent all madcap avery style but more subtle and aimed at anyone whos ever stayed up late watching scary movies or radio programs! tom is listening to a creepy radio show and jerry decides to play a number of tricks to spook him the nine-lives gag is well done here and i dont know how many times i tried to make a vacuum and a sheet that scary when i was a kid when toms owner is awakened by the ruckus- mammy was not the maid it was her house- she gets one heck of a surprise with a big laugh get your pause button ready its worth it!<SEP>1
if you havent seen eva longoria from the tv show desperate house wives then you are missing out eva is going to be one of the biggest latina stars and youll be seeing her in the theaters soon this was evas first film and she does a fantastic job acting she was 24 when she shot it and looked hot then as for this low budget film its pretty good for the first time director who has another soon to be released movie juarez mexico currently playing at many film festivals across the united states in fact it appears that it may have a limited theatrical release from some news what would be nice to see is a snitch2 with a higher budget<SEP>1

errol flynn is gentleman jim in this 1942 film about boxer jim corbett known as the man who beat john l sullivan directed with a light hand by flynns good friend raoul walsh the film also stars alexis smith jack carson alan hale sr william frawley and ward bond flynn plays an ambitious egotistical young man who has a natural talent for boxing and is sponsored by the exclusive olympic club in san francisco in the late 1800s though good-natured the fact that he is a shanty irishman and a social climber builds resentment in olympic club members; most of them cant wait to see him lose a fight and they bet against him despite this he rises to fame even working as an actor finally he gets the chance hes been waiting for a match with the world champion john l sullivan ward bond sullivan demands a $10000 deposit to insure that corbett will appear to fight for the $25000 purse corbett and his manager frawley despair of getting the money however help comes in the form of a very unlikely individualthis is a very entertaining film and jim corbett is an excellent role for flynn who himself was a professional fighter at one time he has the requisite charm good looks and athleticism for the role alexis smith plays victoria ware his romantic interest who insists that she hates him in real life she doesnt seem to have existed; corbett was married to olive lake morris from 1886 to 1895the focus of the film is on corbett and his career rather than the history of boxing corbett used scientific techniques and innovation and is thought of as the man who made prizefighting an art form in the film corbett is fleet of foot and avoids being hit by his opponents; it is believed that he wore down john l sullivan this waygood film to catch flynn at the height of his too-short time as a superstar<SEP>1
when i was at the movie store the other day i passed up blonde and blonder but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie who knows i mean im sure most people bashed romy and michelle before they saw it blonde and blonder might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up but when i started watching it: executive producer pamela anderson wow i knew i was in for something scary not only that but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness: pam anderson and denise richards not to offend them but they were not aging well at all and theyre playing roles that i think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their 20s not their 40s the story was just plain bad and obnoxiousdee and dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical blondes they really dont have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world its just really sad but when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their ignorance is bliss attitudes they are set up to make a hit on a guy and they think theyre just going to show him a good time but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girlsdenise and pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before i know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy but it was more than stupid it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary would i ever recommend this not in a million years the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as sex kittens its more a sign of desperation and blonde and blonder is a huge blonde bombshell110<SEP>0
the only scary thing about this movie is the thought that whoever made it might make a sequelfrom start to finish the tooth fairy was just downright terrible it seemed like a badly-acted childrens movie which got confused with a wizard of oz witch melting and happy kiddies ending combined with some bad gore effects and swearinghalf of the cast seem completely unnecessary except for conveniently being there to get murdered in some fashion the sister of the two brothers cherise the aura reader and mrs mcdonald have entirely no point in the film - they could have included them in the main plot for some interesting side stories but apparently couldnt be bothered the people watching the film know the characters are there for some bloody death scene but come on at least try and have a slight plot for them the story in general is weak with erratic behavior from the characters that makes you wish they all get eaten by the witchadd the weak plot and the weak acting together the children are particularly wooden and the movie ends up a complete failure if only mst3k could have had a go at this one<SEP>0
not to be confused with lewis teagues alligator 1980 which actually is an excellent film this il fiume del grande caimano laboriously ends the exotic trilogy sergio martino made around the end of the seventies including the rather watchable lisola degli uomini pesce and the not so good la montagna del dio cannibale tracing outrageously the plot of jaws the script fails at creating any suspense what so ever the creature is ludicrous and its victims are simply despicable stelvio ciprianis lame tune poorly illustrates the adventures of these silly tourists presented from the very beginning as the obvious items of the reptiles meal no thrill out of this rather laughters actually! and we could find this pitiful flick quite funny if the dialogs and the appearance of the natives were not so obviously inspired by pure racism very soon the giggling stops in favor of a sour feeling witnessing such a patronizing attitude we could excuse badly made films and poor fxs but not that kind of mentality never!<SEP>0
i saw this film on the history channel today in 2006 first of all i realize that this is not a documentary -- that it is a drama but one might hope that at least the critical facts that the story turns on might be based on actual events reagan was shot and the other characters were real people the movie got that right from there on reliance on facts rapidly decays i had never heard of this movie before seeing it having been a tv reporter at the time of these events i was stunned that i had never heard anything about the bizarre behavior of secretary haig as portrayed by richard dreyfuss the whole nation had heard the i am in control etc but dreufuss haig is bullying a cowered cabinet and totally out of control personally having watched the film i began researching the subject on the internet and quickly found actual audio tapes and transcripts of most of the situation room conversations that this film pretends to reenact incredibly many the the principal facts of the film meant to show a white house secret service etc in total chaos -- and the nations leadership behaving irrationally and driving the world near the brink of nuclear war -- are demonstrably incorrect they didnt happen! there is internal conflict to be sure haig makes missteps his press room performance is historically regrettable and he is difficult but there is nothing approaching the scenes depicted in the film there are too many gross errors to list but any fair comparison of the recorded and written record and the fantasy of this film begs the question as to what the producers were really trying to accomplish enlighten inform entertain i believe they failed on all three fronts it is difficult to ascribe motives to others but one must seriously question what was behind such shameless invention and as for my beloved history channels reel to real follow-on documentary there was almost no mention of the issues that were the central focus of the film -- namely the events within the administration on the day of the shooting so the viewer was left to research those without much -- if any -- help from the network<SEP>0
yikes it was definitely one of those sleepless nights where i surfed the channels and bumped into this stinker of a movie for some of the names in the cast id expect a much better movie im almost embarrassed to see oscar winner f murray abraham being reduced to such a horrible part i hope the money was worth it and the students they talked about fencing like they were talking about survival in a war or through a horrible disaster i mean ive fenced its a fun sport but ive never been that intense the only reason i even watched this entire movie was because the remote fell under the sofa and i was too lazy to get it back<SEP>0
i watched the movie in a preview and i really loved it the cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious another highlight of the movie is definitely the music which hopefully will be released soon i recommend it to everyone who likes the british humour and especially to all musicians go and see its great<SEP>1
imagine the worst skits from saturday night live and mad tv in one 90 minute movie now imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity now imagine something 50 times worsegot thatok now go see the underground comedy movie that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever ucm is the single worst movie ive ever seen there were a few cheap laughsvery few but it was lame even if the intent of the movie was to be lame it was too lame to be funnythe only reason im not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else i know bought it he wasted his money vince offer hasnt written or directed anything else and its not surprise why<SEP>0
im a christian i have always been skeptical about movies made by christians however as a rule they are know-nothings when it comes to movie production i admire tbn for trying to present god and jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen however they did a hideous job of it the acting was horrible and unless one is familiar with the bible in some fashion one could not have understood what the movie was trying to get across not only was the movie terribly made but the people who made it even had some facts wrong however in this critique those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into in short the omega code is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen and i would not recommend it to anyone except for comic relief from the every day grind<SEP>0
i bought this on dvd for my brother who is a big michelle pfeiffer fan i decided to watch it myself earlier this weekit is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines the section with michelle pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two she plays a rising hollywood actress who has had many short unfulfilling relationships she literally bumps into brian kerwin a regular married guy with kidsafter driving her car into the back of his after being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable to drive romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out what happens at the end i was not prepared for but the slow pacing and routine tv direction takes any drama out of the plotthe other section involves an old studio boss played by darren mcgavin this section actually has the better cast with kenneth mcmillan lois chiles steven bauer & stella stevens they all want something from the studio boss but in the end when he is asked to resign they all realize their careers will now be going nowhere it passes the time but is not all that interesting and i am glad this was not bought for me i am not a michelle pffeifer fan but she was admittedly the only actor worth watching in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress overall though unless you are a fan of hers avoid this as it is very routine<SEP>0
can anybody do good cgi films besides pixar i mean really animation looked antiquated by 2006 standards and even by 1995 toy story standards or maybe they spent all their budget on hugh jackman whatever their reasoning the story truly did sucksomehow hugh jackman is a rat - a rat that is flushed down a toilet yeah i know seems stereotypical but then the sewer mimicked the ways of london - to an extent throw in a promise of jewels and an evil frog and you get a pathetic attempt at entertainmenti would like to say something entertained me maybe the hookup in the movie or maybe the happily-ever-after rat relationship but nothing did it had the talent but it blew up d-<SEP>0
while i certainly consider the exorcist to be a horror classic i have to admit that i dont hold it in quite as high regard as many other horror fans do as a consequence of that i havent seen many of the exorcist rip-offs and if exorcismo is anything to go by ill have to say thats a good thing as this film is boring as hell and certainly not worth spending ninety minutes on it! in fairness to the other exorcist rip-offs this is often considered one of the worst and so maybe it wasnt the best place for me to start its not hard to guess what the plot will be: basically its the same as the one in the exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit which happens to be the spirit of her dead father the village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism like many spanish horror films this one stars paul naschy who is pretty much the best thing about the film exorcismo was directed by juan bosch who previously directed the derivative spanish giallo the killer wore gloves i havent seen any of his other films but on the basis of these two: i believe that originality wasnt one of his strong points theres not a lot of good things i can say about the film itself; it mostly just plods along and the exorcism scene isnt worth waiting for i certainly dont recommend it!<SEP>0
another entry in the holiday horror category that fills the shelves of your local video store the *spoiler* wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the cool kids who wronged him plot will of course be familiar to those whove watched it before and those whove seen it before will probably watch it again; those who are expecting ingmar bergman and will subsequently become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it marilyn manson on the soundtrack and david boreanaz denise richards and katherine heigl as eye candy--go with the flow and enjoy it oh and i loved the creepy mask<SEP>1
i thought harvey keitel a young fresh from the sex pistols john lydon then as a bonus the music by ennio morricone i expected an old-school edgy italian cop thriller that was made in america istead i got a mishmash story that never made sense and a movie that left me saying: wtf!!! too many unanswered questions and not enough action the result: a potential cult classic got flushed down the toilet keitel and lydon work well together so maybe quentin tarantino can reunite these guys with better script oh and the morricone score: ok but not memorableoverall not a waste of time but not a must see unless you are a hardcore keitel fan<SEP>0
the villian in this movie is one mean sob and he seems to enjoy what he is doing that is what i guess makes him so mean i dont think most men will like this movie especially if they ever cheated on their wife this is one of those movies that pretty much stays pretty mean to the very end but then there you have it a candy-bar ending that makes me look back and say hokie as hell a pretty good movie until the end ending is the ending we would like to see but not the ending to such a mean beginning and then there is the aftermath of what happened guess you can make up your own mind about the true ending im left feeling that only one character should have survived at the end<SEP>1
as a dane im proud of the handful of good danish movies that have been produced in recent years its a terrible shame however that this surge in quality has led the majority of danish movie critics to lose their sense of criticism in fact it has become so bad that i no longer trust any reviews of danish movies and as a result i have stopped watching them in theatersi know its wrong to hold this unfortunate development against any one movie so let me stress that villa paranoia would be a terrible film under any circumstances the fact that it was hyped by the critics just added fuel to my bonfire of disillusionment with danish film furthermore waiting until it came out on dvd was very little help against the unshakable feeling of having wasted time and money erik clausen is an accomplished director with a knack for social realism in copenhagen settings i particularly enjoyed de frigjorte 1993 as an actor he is usually funny though he generally plays the same role in all of his movies namely that of a working-class slob whos down on his luck partly because hes a slob but mostly because of society and who redeems himself by doing something good for his community this is problem number one in villa paranoia; clausen casts himself as a chicken farmer which is such a break from the norm that he never succeeds in making it credible it is much worse however that the film has to make twists and turns and break all rules of how to tell a story to make the audience understand what is going on for instance the movie opens with a very sad attempt at visualizing the near-death experience of the main character with the use of low-budget effects and bad camera work after that the character tells her best friend that she suddenly felt the urge to throw herself off a bridge this is symptomatic of the whole movie; there is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters and clausen resorts to the lowest form of communicating whatever motivation there is: telling instead of showing thus at one point you have a character talking out loud to a purportedly catatonic person about the way he feels because the script wouldnt allow him to act out his feelings; and later on voice-over is abruptly introduced quite possibly as an afterthought to convey feelings that would otherwise remain unknown to the audience due to the directors ineptitude fortunately at this point youre roughly an hour past caring about any of the characters let alone the so-called storythe acting which has frequently been a problem in clausens movies can be summed up in one sad statement: søren westerberg bentsen whose only other claim to stardom was as a contestant on big brother is no worse than several of the heralded actors in the casti give this a 2-out-of-10 rating<SEP>0
i have decided to not believe what famous movie critics say even though this movie did not get the best comments this movie made my day it got me thinking what a false world this iswhat do you do when your most loved ones deceive you its said that no matter how often you feed milk to a snake it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance same way some people are such that they are never grateful this movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone is ultimately just thinking about oneself and working for oneself a brother dies inadvertently at the hands of a gangster the surviving brother decides to take revenge through this process we learn about the futility of this world nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyoneamitabh gave the performance of his life the new actor aryan gave a good performance the actress who played the wife of amitabh stole the show her role was small but she portrayed her role so diligently that one is moved by her performance chawla had really great face expressions but her role was very limited and was not given a chance to fully express herselfa great movie by raj kumar santoshi his movies always give some message to the audience his movies are like novels of nanak singh a punjabi novelist whos novels always had a purpose and targeted a social evil because they have a real message for the audience they are entertaining as well as lesson-giving<SEP>1
this service comedy for which peter marshall joanne drus brother and later perennial host of the hollywood squares and tommy noonan were hyped as the new lewis and martin is just shy of dreadful: a few random sight gags are inserted everyone talks fast and nothing works quite right -- theres one scene in which noonan is throwing grenades at officers and politicians in anger; theyre about five feet apart noonan is throwing them in between and the total reaction is that everyone flinchesin the midst of an awfulness relieved only by the fetching julie newmar there are a few moments of brightness: marshall and noonan engage in occasional bouts of double talk and argufying and their timing is nigh unto perfect -- clearly they were a well honed comedy pairit isnt enough to save this turkey alas<SEP>0
i have just recently purchased collection one of this awesome series and even after just watching three episodes i still am mesmerized by sleek styling of the animation and the slow yet thoughtful actions of the story-telling i am still a fanwith some minor painsthough this installment into the gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series had-a stylish satiric way of telling about the wrongs of war and not letting go of the need to have control or power over everythingsound familiar i have to say that this one gets a bit too mellow-dramatic on continuing to explain the lives of the main characters and their incessant need to belly-ache about every thing that happens and what they need to do to stop the oz group from succeeding in their plansespecially the character called wufeii mean he whines more than an american character on a soap opera get a counselorwill yabesides for the over-exaggerated dramai think that mostly comes from the dubbing of the english voice actors this series is still very exciting and will still captivate me once again i mean it can always be worse it could be like the recent installment seedeeeewwww talk about mellow-dramaticill chat about that one later<SEP>1
what a terrible filmit starts well with the title sequence but thats about as good as it getsthe movie is something about rats turning into monsters and going on a killing spree the acting isnt so much poor but the script is pointless and the film isnt even scary despite the atmospheric musicit really is amazing that some group cobbled together this bag of rubbish and thought it would make a good filmit isnt a good film its trash and i urge you not to waste a minute of your life on it! one out of ten<SEP>0
i cannot believe the same guy directed this crap and dracula 2000 dracula 2000 was innovative fresh and well written if poorly actedthis pile cant even claim that it starts with the defeat of dracula at the end of dracula 2000 then ignores the narrative afterwards describing what happened after that following the narrative properly could have made this a good sequel somehow but craven chose to go in the style of his older films having no good tie but the main villains nameeven the actor playing dracula was different going from dark hair in dracula 2000 to a blonde hereavoid this movie if you have any respect for your taste in movies<SEP>0
i liked this film a lot its dark its not a bullet-dodging car-chasing numb your brain action movie a lot of the characters backgrounds and motivations are kinda vague leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions its nice to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to make up their own mindsin the end motivated by love or vengeance or a desire to repent - he does what he feels is right will god ever forgive us for what weve done - its not a question mortal men can answer - so he does what he feels he has to do what hes good at what hes been trained to dodenzel washington is a great actor - i honestly cant think of one bad movie hes done - and hes got a great supporting cast i would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone<SEP>1
this is a cgi animated film based upon a french 2d animated series the series ran briefly on cartoon network but its run was so brief that its inclusion as one of the potential oscar nominees for best animated film for this year left most people i know going huh this is the story of lian-chu the kind heart muscle and gwizdo the brains of the operation who along with hector their fire farting dragonhes more like a dog travel the world offering up their services as dragon hunters but never getting paid into their lives comes zoe the fairy tale loving niece of a king who is going blind it seems the world is being devoured by a huge monster and all of the knights the king has sent out have never returned or if the do return they come back as ashes in desperation the king hires the dragon hunters to stop the world eater zoe of course tags alongwhat can i say other then why is this film hiding under a rock this is a really good little film that is completely off the radar except as unlikely oscar contender its a beautifully designed fantastic looking film the world it takes place has floating lands and crazy creatures that constantly had me going wow at it the english voice cast with forrest whitaker as lian-chu one of the best vocal performances ive ever heard and rob paulson as gwizdo think steve bucsemi is first rate equally great is the script which doesnt talk down to its audience using some real expressions not normally heard in animated films not disney nor pixar its all really well doneis it perfect no some of the bits go on too long but at the same time its is damn entertainingif you get the chance see this its one of the better animated films from 2008 and is going on my nice surprise list for 2009<SEP>1
i really looked forward to this program for two reasons; i really liked jan michael vincent and i am an aviation nut and have a serious love affair with helicopters i dont like this program because it takes fantasy to an unbelievable level the world speed record for helicopters was set at 249 mph by a westland lynx several years ago the only chopper that was ever faster was the experimental lockheed ah56a in the 1960s it hit over 300 and was a compound helicopter which means it had a pusher propeller at the end of its fuselage providing thrustin short no helicopter can fly much over 275 because of the principle of rotary wing flight and the bell 222 the actor that portrayed airwolf wasnt very fast even by helicopter standards and it didnt stay in production very longthere was a movie that came out during this time period called blue thunder that was much more realistic<SEP>0
with knightly and otool as the leads this film had good possibilities and with mccallum as the bad guy after knightly maybe some tension but they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants it was of course totally superficial beautiful english country and seaside or notthe number one mistake was dumping knightly so early on in the film when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part they missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low-cost heartstring elements<SEP>0
this film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures sure the effects are laughable the story confused but just watching hasselhoff in his knight rider days is always fun i especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in it added to what little suspense was mustered give it a 3<SEP>0
former brat pack actor and all round pretty boy rob lowe stars in a film set in a high security american prison i had a gut feeling his character was going to be popular for all the wrong reasons like tobias in the first series of oz but proximity isn`t that kind of film it`s more like a man on the run film like the fugitive it also makes a nod to the themes of punishment and justice with james coburn putting in a cameo as the spokesman for a justice for victims pressure group but any intelligent discussion on how society should treat criminals is completely ignored as the film degenerates into tired old cliches of shoot outs and car chases<SEP>0
i found time at the top an entertaining and stimulating experience the acting while not generally brilliant was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good as a film obviously aimed at the younger demographic it is certainly one of the better works in the genre childrens sci-fi normally i would say that canada the united kingdom and australia produce the best movies and tv shows for children and time at the top does nothing to discount this theory! i dont think that continuity and great acting are important to younger people a good plot and an imaginative screenplay are far more important to them both are in abundance in this film the special effects are good without detracting from the story or closing the viewers off from their own imaginations it would have been very easy to inject an over-load of sfx in this film but it would have totally destroyed its entire raison detre the settings and camera work are of a very high standard in this movie and complement the fine wardrobe and historical accuracy overall this film is highly satisfactory and i recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through childrens eyes or those that try to like myself! now i really must read the original book as soon as possible<SEP>1
ira levins deathtrap is one of those mystery films in the tradition of sleuth that would be very easy to spoil given any real examination of the plot of the film therefore i will be brief in saying it concerns a play one man who is a famous mystery playwright another man who is a promising writer the playwrights wife who is much younger and sexier than the role should have been and one german psychic along for the ride director sidney lumet no stranger to film is quite good for the most part in creating the tension the film needs to motor on the dialog is quick fresh and witty michael caine excels in roles like these christopher reeve is serviceable and actually grows on you the more you see him act irene worth stands out as the funny psychic how about dyan cannon love how lumet packaged her posterior in those real tight-fitting pants and had her wear possibly the snuggest tops around but she is terribly miscast in this role - a role which should have been given to an older actress and one certainly less seductive but why quibble with an obvious attempt to bribe its male viewers when nothing will change it now deathtrap is funny sophisticated witty and classy the mystery has some glaring flaws which do detract somewhat and i was not wholly satisfied with the ending but watching caine and reeve under lumets direction with levins elevated verbiage was enough to ensnare my interest and keep it captive the entire length of the film<SEP>1
isabel allendes magical lyrical novel about three generations of an aristocratic south american family was vandalized the lumbering oaf of a movie that resulted--largely due to a magnificent cast of anglo actors completely unable to carry off the evasive latin mellifluousness of allendes characters and a plodding scandinavian directorial hand--was so uncomfortable in its own skin that i returned to the theater a second time to make certain i had not missed something vital that might change my opinion to my disappointment i had not missed a thing none among meryl streep jeremy irons glenn close and vanessa redgrave could wiggle free of the trap set for them by director bille august all of them looked perfectly stiff and resigned as if by putting forth as little effort as possible they expected to fade unnoticed into lovely period sets yes the film was art directed within an inch of its life curious that the production designer was permitted the gaffe of placing kfc products prominently in a scene that occurs circa 1970--years before kfc came into being back then it was known by its original name: kentucky fried chicken even pardoning that what on earth is kentucky fried chicken doing in a military dictatorship in south america in 1970 american fast food chains did not hit south america until the early 1980s the house of the spirits should have been the motion picture event of 1993 because it was so club-footed and slavishly faithful to its vague idea of what the novel represented miramax had to market it as an art film as a result it was neither event nor art and for that isabel allende should have pressed charges for rape<SEP>0
a found tape about 3 guys having fun torturing a woman in several inhuman waysyeah spoilerfirst of all the acting made this short not scary at all the woman seemed to have orgasms not suffering some of the punishments were so ridiculous! whats shocking about throwing some meat or spin her in a chair if you are shooting a nonsense tape at least make it good the only part to remark is the end: the hammered hand and the pierced eye the rest of the film is really poor to end the boredom the supposed story about the tape being investigated extra bullshit<SEP>0
99999% pure crap and the other 001% was a brief moment where i thought the blond chick was going to disrobe nopethe dialogue was legendarily bad the action sucked and there was no sex the afore mentioned blond chick is modestly dressed alas the whole movie the cgi had the dubious honor of being the worst ive ever seen on film and the anachronisms were numerous and glaring acting was mediocre even from ben cross and marina sirtis the only names in this movie and marina sirtis looked really really badive seen high school plays more capably produced this is the kind of movie that mst3k thrived on heads should roll at sci-fi for allowing this steaming pile on the air<SEP>0
san francisco is a big city with great acting credits in this one the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city they didnt even manage the most basic of realistic details so i would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a san francisco movie you will not be thinking oh ive been there you will be thinking how did a two story firetrapstinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby some of the leads used east coast speech styles and affectations it detracts but the acting was always competentthe stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles at least in the beginning the chinatown story was the most effective and interesting the plot is weak ripped scene for scene from classy hong kong action movies the originals had a lot more tension and emotional resonance they were framed and paced better but the acting is fun and we get to see james hong and other luminariesthe white boy intro was pointless i think the filmmakers didnt know what to do with it so they left it loosely structured and cut it down the father is an odd attempt at a berkeley liberal - really folks everyone knows its not groovy to live in the ghetto - but his segments are the most humorous they threw away some good opportunities educated and embittered on the west coast a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in new york they are equally intolerable but always distinguishable that would have been interesting; this was notthe hunters point intro was the most disappointing it was the most derivative of the three and stylistically the most distant from san francisco youve seen it done before and youve seen it done better even the video game was better! despite the generic non-locality and aimless script these characters have potential the actors have talent and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction about ten minutes before the ending good concept placed in the wrong handsps there is a missing minority here see if you can guess which one<SEP>0
i was pretty young when this came out in the us but i recorded it from tv and watched it over and over again until i had the whole thing memorized to this day i still catch myself quoting it the show itself was hilarious and had many famous characters from frank sinatra to sylvester stallone to mr t the voices were great and sounded just like the characters they were portraying the puppets were also well done although a little creepy i was surprised to find out just recently that it was written by rob grant and doug naylor of red dwarf a show that i also enjoy very much like another person had written in a comment earlier i too was robbed of this great show by a friend who borrowed it and never returned it i sure wish there was enough demand for this show to warrant a dvd release but i dont think enough people have heard of it oh well maybe ill try e-bay<SEP>1

oscar wildes comedy of manners perhaps the wittiest play ever written is all but wrecked at the hands of a second-rate cast sanders is as one would expect casually indolently brilliant in the role of lord darlington but the rest of the cast makes the entire procedure a waste of time jean crain attempts a stage accent in alternate sentences and the other members of the cast seem to believe this is a melodrama and not a comedy; indeed the entire production has bookends that reduce it to tragedy -- doubtless the hays office insisted premingers direction seems to lie mostly in making sure that there are plenty of servants about and even the music seems banal stick with the visually perfect silent farce as directed by lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with helen hunt as mrs erlynne; or try reading the play for the pleasure of the words but skip this version<SEP>0
i dont like grade inflation but i just had to give this a 10 i cant think of anything i didnt like about it i saw it last night and woke up today thinking about it im sure that the hollywood remake that someone told me about with j lo and richard gear will be excellent but this original japanese version from 1996 was so emotional and thought-provoking for me that i am hard-pressed to think of any way that it could be improved or its setting changed to a different culturea story i found worth watching and with o fist-fight scenes or guns going off or anything of the sort! imagine that!all the characters seemed well-developed even non-primary characters had good character-development and enjoyable acting and the casting seemed very appropriate its always hard to find a good movie-musical in our day and age and perhaps this doesnt quite qualify there is plenty of learning how to dance but no singing but i really think that gene kelly and others who championed a place for dance in our lives would have thought so very highly of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell a story about a middle aged man successful with a family in japan looking for something he knows not precisely whatto the team of people in japan who contributed to this film thank you for creating and doing it<SEP>1
in a wordamazingi initially was not too keen to watch pinjar since i thought this would be another movie lamenting over the partition and would show biases towards india and pakistan i was so totally wrong pinjar is a heart-wrenching emotional and intelligent movie without any visible flaws i was haunted by it after watching it it lingered on my mind for so long; the themes the pain the loss the emotion- all was so realthis is truly a masterpiece that one rarely gets to see in bollywood nowadays it has no biases or prejudices and has given the partition a human story here no one country is depicted as good or bad there are evil indians evil pakistanis and good indians and pakistanis the cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious meaningful thanks to gulzar sahib and haunting everything about the movie was amazingand the acting just took my breath away all were perfectly castif you are interested in watching an intellectual and genuinely wonderful movielook no further this movie gives it all i recommend it with all my heart amazing cannot describe how excellent it is<SEP>1
unfortunately this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original nicholas cage fairly wooden as far as actors go imbues the screen with a range of skill from non-plussed to over the top the supporting cast is no betterthe plot stays much the same as the original in terms of scene progression but is far worse not enough detail is given to allow the audience to by into what is being sold it turns out its just a bill of poor goods disbelief cannot be suspended nor can a befit of a doubt be given the only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual as the medium requires and whomever scouted the location should be commendedthere was much laughter in the audience and multiple boos literally at the enddisappointed! wait for the original to come on television pour a whiskey and enjoy<SEP>0
if you like cars you will love this film!there are some superb actors in the film especially vinnie jones with his typical no nonsense attitude and hardcase appearancethe others are not bad eitherthere are only two slight flaws to this film firstly the poor plot however people dont watch this film for the plot secondly the glorification of grand theft auto car crime however if people really believe they can steal a ferrari and get away with it then good look to them hope you have a good time in jail!when i first read that nicolas cage was to act the main role i first thought sweeet but then i thought naaaa you suck! but then finally after watching the film i realised yep he sucks!only joking he plays the role very wellill end this unusual review by saying if the premature demise of a criminal has in some way enlightened the general cinema going audience as to the grim finish below the glossy veneer of criminal life and inspired them to change their ways then this death carries with it an inherent nobility and a supreme glory we should all be so fortunate you can say poor criminal i say: poor usps - angelina jolie voight looks quite nice!<SEP>1

the invisible boy kel mitchell who claims to turn invisible when absolutely no one is looking at him; the spleen paul reubens granted mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy; and the much underused sphinx wes studi who is shown to be able to cut guns in half with his mind then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting inane riddles and acting over-wisethis film really is a cross-genre romp anyone wanting to pigeon-hole films into neat little categories is fighting a losing battle this is a spoofparody of the superhero genre - from the pseudo-burton sets recycled endlessly and occasionally decorated with more spoof material to the ridiculous costumes the comic-book genre gets a pretty good send-up but at the same time it is a serious superhero flick as well both at once while not a necessarily unique idea in itself for example this movie is in some ways reflective of dc comics short-lived inferior five work it is fairly innovative for the big screen it offers the comic-book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway then throws in the inevitable wanna-bes - and we all know if superheroes were real so would these guys be real if the big guy with the s were flying around new york city youd see a half-dozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis sure the shoveller fights pretty well and the blue raja hurls forks with great accuracy - all parts of the super-hero world but does that make them genuine super-heroes only in their mindsthis movie is also a comedy albeit a dark one inevitable when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of super-heroics one-liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of particularly marvelous is the dialogue by janeane garofalo with her bowling ballfather yet it isnt a comedy in the sense of side-splitting laughter or eternally memorable jokes it mixes in a dose of drama of discovery and of romance but never really ventures fully into any of itwhat really makes mystery men a good film in the end is that it is very engaging the weaklame good guys are eventually justified and for one shining moment really become super-heroes; justice is served; and the movie ends with a scene that reeks of realism as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise if the viewer stops trying to label the film then the film can be a great rompof course no movie is perfect claire forlani comes off as bored and directionless as mr furious love interest in spite of having a pivotal role as his conscience tom waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the mad inventor dr heller although his opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone and the villians are never more than gun-toting lackeys a point of which is made in the film the cinematography is choppy and disjointed such as happens in the average comic book so it is excusable the music sometimes overpowers the scenery and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very wellyet overall this film is incredible you probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie but its a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest810 in my opinion<SEP>1
this is a very moving picture about 3 forty-something best friends in a small england town one finds a passionate loves and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor when tragedy strikes and hearts are changed forever definitely a film to have a box of tissues with you! a powerful piece of work this is definitely one of my favorite films of all time*spoiler!!! spoiler alert!! spoiler!!*the main character is taken by her young handsome piano instructor and a passionate romance blossoms her two jealous friends play an immature prank which quickly leads to tragedy she loses her love and her friends in one foul swoop in the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back togetherin my opinion her forgiveness is not warranted<SEP>1

i saw this last week after picking up the dvd cheap i had wanted to see it for ages finding the plot outline very intriguing so my disappointment was great to say the least i thought the lead actor was very flat this kind of part required a performance like johny depps in the ninth gate of which this is almost a complete rip-off but i guess tv budgets dont always stretch to this kind of acting abilityi also the thought the direction was confused and dull serving only to remind me that carpenter hasnt done a decent movie since in the mouth of madness as for the story - well i was disappointed there as well! there was no way it could meet my expectation i guess but i thought the payoff and explanation was poor and the way he finally got the film anti-climactic to say the leastthis was written by one of the main contributors to aicn and you can tell he does love his cinema but i would have liked a better result from such a good initial premisei took the dvd back to the store the same day!<SEP>0

although she is little known today deanna durbin was one of the most popular stars of the 1930s a pretty teenager with a perky personality and a much-admired operatic singing voice this 1937 was her first major film and it proved a box-office bonanza for beleaguered universal studiosthree smart girls concerns three daughters of a divorced couple who rush to their long-unseen father when their still-faithful mother reveals he may soon remarry--with the firm intention of undermining his gold-digger girlfriend and returning him to their mother although the story is slight the script is witty and the expert cast plays it with a neat screwball touch durbin has a pleasing voice and appealing personality and such enjoyable character actors as charles winninger alice brady lucile watson and mischa auer round out the cast a an ultra-light amusement for fans of 1930s filmgary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer<SEP>1
beside the fact that in all its awesomeness this movie has risen beyond all my expectations this masterpiece of cinema history portrait the overuse of crappy filters in its best! paul johansson and craig sheffer show a brotherconflict with all there is to it as usual a woman concieling her true intentions the end came as surprising as unforssen as the killing of keith scott by his older brotherthe scenes in wiking land are just as i remember it from my early time travels - to be honest my strong passion for trash movies makes this one a must have in my never finished collectioni recommend this movie to all the people in love with the most awesome brother cast from one tree hill-odin-<SEP>1

of the many problems with this film the worst is continuity; and re-editing it on vhs for a college cable channel many years ago i tried to figure out what exactly went wrong what seems to have happened is that they actually constructed a much longer film and then chopped it down for standard theatrical viewing how much longer to fill in all the holes in the plot as we have it would require about three more hours of narrative and character development - especially given the fact that the film we do have is just so slow and takes itself just so seriouslythats staggering; what could the halperins have possibly been trying to accomplish here their previous film white zombie was a successful low budget attempt to duplicate the early universal studios monster films the mummy dracula etc and as such stuck pretty close to the zombie mythology that those in north america would know from popular magazinesrevolt of the zombies to the contrary appears to have been intended as some allegory for the politics of modern war this would not only explain the opening and the change of dean jaggers character into a megalomaniac but it also explains why the zombies dont actually do much in the film besides stand around look frightening and wait for orders - theyre just allegorical soldiers not the undead cannibals weve all come to love and loathe in zombie filmsi am the equal to any in my dislike for modern war and its politics - but i think a film ought to be entertaining first and only later maybe educational and definitely - a film about zombies ought to be about zombiestruly one of the most bizarre films in hollywood history but not one i can recommend even for historic value<SEP>0
after dipping his toes in the giallo pool with the masterful film the strange vice of mrs wardh 1971 director sergio martino followed up that same year with what turns out to be another twisty suspense thriller the case of the scorpions tail like his earlier effort this one stars handsome macho dude george hilton who would go on to star in martinos satanicgiallo hybrid all the colors of the dark the following year scorpions tail also features the actors luigi pistilli and anita strindberg who would go on to portray an unhappy couple to put it mildly! in martinos your vice is a locked room and only i have the key 1972 i just love that title! i suppose edwige fenech was busy the month they shot this! anyway this film boasts the stylish direction that martino fans would expect as well as a twisty plot some finely done murder set pieces and beautiful athenian location shooting the story this time concerns an insurance investigator hilton and a journalist strindberg here looking like farrah fawcetts prettier smarter sister who become embroiled in a series of grisly murders following a plane crash and the inheritance of $1 million by a beautiful widow i really thought i had this picture figured out halfway through but i was dead wrong although the plot does make perfect sense in this giallo i may have to watch the film again to fully appreciate all its subtleties highlights of the picture for me were anitas cat-and-mouse struggle with the killer at the end a particularly suspenseful house break-in and a nifty fight atop a tiled roof; lots of good action bursts in this movie! the fine folks at no shame are to be thanked for still another great-looking dvd with nice subtitling and interesting extras whotta great outfit its turned out to be in its ongoing quest to bring these lost italian gems back from oblivion<SEP>1
this movie was horrible i swear they didnt even write a script they just kinda winged it through out the whole movie ice-t was annoying as hell *spoilers phht more like reasons not to watch it* they sit down and eat breakfast for 20 minutes he coulda been long gone the ground was hard it would of been close to impossible to to track him with out dogs and when ice-t is on that hill and uses that spaz-15 assault shotgun like its a sniper rifle and then cuts down a tree with eight shells it would take 1000s of shells to cut down a tree that size shotguns and hand guns are considered to be inaccurate at 100yards and they even saw the reflection what reflected the light i didnt see a scope on that thing also when he got shot in the gut and kept going that was retarded he would of bled to death right there plusthe ending where he stuffs a rock or a cigarette in the guys barrel it wouldnt blow up and kill him the bullet would still fire kill ice t but mess up the barrel<SEP>0
i think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943 though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness the film is set in 1940--just before the entry of the us into the war paul lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family hes a german who has spent seven years fighting the nazis and avoiding capture bette davis is his very understanding and long-suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time as the film begins they are crossing the border from mexico to the usa and for the first time in years they are going to relax and stop runningthe problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent--making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems while this had a very noble goal at the time it just seems phony today in particular the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didnt ring true it sounded more like anti-fascism speeches than the voices of real children they were as a result extremely annoying--particularly the littlest one who came off at times as a brat about the only ones who sounded real were bette davis and her extended american family as well as the scumbag romanian living with them though he had no discernible accentits really tough to believe that the ultra-famous dashiel hammett wrote this dialog as it just doesnt sound true to life the story was based on the play by his lover lillian hellman and the basic story idea and plot is goodbut the dialog is just bad at times overall an interesting curio and a film with some excellent momentsbut thats really about all<SEP>1
after repeated listenings to the cd soundtrack i knew i wanted this film got it for christmas and i was amazed marc bolan had such charisma i cant describe it id heard about him in that way but didnt understand what people were talking about until i was in the company of this footage he was incredible clips from the wembley concert are interspersed with surrealistic sketches such as nuns gorging themselves at a garden party as marc bolan performs some acoustic versions of get it on etc im still learning the song titles george claydon the diminutive photographer from magical mystery tour plays a chauffeur who jumps out of a car and eats one of the side mirrors nothing i can say to describe it would spoil it even though i put the spoilers disclaimer on this review so you would just need to see this for yourselves it evades description yes i love the beatles and was curious about ringo directing a rock documentary - that was 35 years ago - now i finally find out its been on dvd for 2 years but its finally in my home its an amazing viewing experience - even enthralling now the dvd comes with hidden extras and the following is a copy and paste from another user: theres two hidden extras on the born to boogie double dvd release 1from the menu on disc oneselect the bonus material and goto the extra scenes 2on the extra scenes page goto scene 42 take 1 and keep pressing left 3when the cursor disappears keep pressing right until a star+1972 logo appears 4press enter 5from the main menu on disc twoselect the sound options 6on the sound options page goto the 9025 i think thats right option and keep pressing left 7when the cursor disappears keep pressing right until a star+home video logo appears 8press enter<SEP>1
first off if youre planning on watching this make sure to watch the uncut version although it is very interesting to go back and then watch the scenes that were tampered with due to censorship it makes a huge difference this film is about a young woman played by barbara stanwyck who since the age of 14 has been forced into prostitution by her own father when her father suddenly passes away she is able to go out into the world on her own after reading about nietzsches philosophies on life she uses her sexuality to manipulate men into giving her what she wants and leaves them in ruins and desperate for her love throughout the movie she becomes increasingly materialistic and manipulative and the audience begins to wonder is she has any sense of morality left at all overall baby face is a very shocking movie with blatant scenes of sexuality that most people would not expect to see in a black and white film while no sexual acts are explicitly shown on screen it is very obvious what is happening off camerai enjoyed watching this film very much and i believe most modern audiences will get at least some enjoyment out if it especially with the films shock value i did think while watching it that the pacing seemed a bit slow at parts but i think that about most movies the first time is see them actually i think that almost all movies ive seen made from the early 30s had some minor pacing problems or certain parts just didnt quite flow right this was probably just the craft of film-making wasnt quite perfected yet  it would take just a few more years compare a film from 1939 and compare it with an early 30s film and i think youll see what i meanonce again im very glad i was able to watch the original cut; it really does make a big difference also any john wayne fans will be surprised to see him in this movie before he was famous in an uncharacteristic role<SEP>1
usually i love lesbian movies even when they are not very good im biased i guess! but this one is just the pits yes the scenery and the buildings are beautiful and there is a brief but beautiful erotic interlude but otherwise this movie is just a complete waste of time annamarie alternates between sulking and getting highstonedpassing out on whatever drug or booze is handy and ella inexplicably puts up with this abominable behavior through the entire movie at no time are we given any insight into why this is so or even why annamarie is so depressed and withdrawnif there had at least been some kind of closure in the potentially romantic we dont even know! relationship between the two there might have been some kind of satisfaction but although annamarie at one point asks ella why do you love me ella doesnt even acknowledge this its never really clear whether this is anything more than an ill-behaved lesbian on a boring road trip with a straight womaneven the interactions between the two women and the local people they meet on the journey which could have been lively and informative are instead flat tedious and mostly incomprehensiblethere is one good joke in the movie although im sure it was unintentional the women travel in a two-seat ford coupe with a middling sized trunk yet when they set up camp they have an enormous tent cots sleeping gear and even a table chair and typewriter! on top of that when they board a ferry we see piles of luggage presumably theirs presumably also carried in the little fords trunk! and through the entire film we never see one gas station or anywhere that looks like it would actually have any place to buy gasoline mostly they travel through endless miles of desolate desert so where did they get fuelthere may not be too many lesbian films out there good or bad but there are plenty that are better than this and very few that are worse leave this one in the rack<SEP>0
this was a blind buy used dvd it totally killed a nice buzz i had going when i hit playits bubble-headed comedy but its um squalid the plot is zany! but the characters do things to each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently contrived i ultimately found it depressing to watchmaybe the box lead me to expect something more than an uneven goofy caper film i know i know the quotes on the box & the academy award nomination mean nothing<SEP>0
the seventh sign borrows a lot from rosemarys baby and the omen it actually blends the two storieseven its title recalls bergman s the seventh seal neverthelessit begins well enoughwith all the omens scattered on the whole earthand in parallel a -seemingly- distinct plot with moores husband trying to save a poor boy who killed his parents who were brother and sisterfrom death penaltythis timeboth christian and jewish religions are called to the rescue even the wandering jew is involvedwhich makes the lines sometimes unintentionally funny have you ever been to sunday school but they taught me that god was love!the best scene imho is the short dialog between priest john heard -who does not seem to take things seriously too bad he was not given a more important part because his laid-back acting is priceless-and the young jewdemi moore probably registered the same desire as ex-husband bruce willis :saving the worldshe does not save the movie for all that<SEP>0
a neat race against time premise - a murdered john doe is found to have pneumonic plague so while the health authority and nopd battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts the murderers think the heat is because the victims infected cousin is holding out on them this movie is freely available from the internet archive and its well worth downloading a lot all of this movie was filmed in genuine new orleans locations which makes it interesting to look at for what is now period detail though to me it does look under-exposed even for noir - maybe mobile lighting rigs then werent what they are there is also a plenty of location background noise which is slightly distracting - car horns in the love scene anyone there are a lot of non-professional supporting artists in crowd scenes and this may explain why the pacing of the film is slightly saggy to begin with - not much chance for retakes or recasting though the final chase is worth hanging on for theres not much wrong with the lead actors either: jack palance is genuinely scary as a charismatic intelligent psychopath - the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrific while widmark as he often did pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level - most of the time somebody should remake this - no supernaturals no mysticism no special fx just a good yarn full of character conflict and a topical theme another reviewer mentioned the writer john kennedy otoole and thats spot on with the number of oddball new orleans types peppering this dark sleazy against-the-clock drama theres even a midget newspaper sellercommunity what community dyou think youre living in the middle ages<SEP>1
honestly i dont know whats funnier this horrific remake or the comments on this board masterpieces review had me in tears thats so funny anyway this movie is the among the worst movies ever and certainly the bottom of the barrel for sequels the omen name on the title made me stop and watch it this morning on hbo but its a slap in the face to the other three especially the original there are so many classically bad moments but my favorite is the guy catching fire from the juggler at the psychic fair!! good times ! this movie is to the omen series what scary movie is to the entire genre avoid unless youre looking for a good laugh<SEP>0

if i had never read the book i would have said it was a good movie but i did read the book who ever did the screen write ruined the storyline there is so many changes that it wasnt really worthy of the title character changes plot changes time line changesfirst off who was henry and the investigator they werent in the story henry had mitchs persona somewhat but mitch wasnt a cop no you made it so roz helped sink his body and used that as zenias blackmail against roz the real so called blackmail was roz thought zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to get away from him her son was also being blackmailed because he was hiding being gay from his mother her son wasnt even really mentioned in the story neither i dont believe was his lover rozs secretarytony and west were not together in the beginning he was actually with zenia first while in college the black painted apartment was their idea tony just went to visit this is where zenia and tony meet become fast friends tony hides her love for west then zenia left west with cash from tony then west and tony get together eventually marry at some point west leaves tony for zenia again for a short time only to be heart broken again then go back to tony zenias blackmail for tony was that tony had written a test paper for zenia now being a professor at college she didnt want to let it get out i will say the character who played tony did it wonderfullycharis character was a blond not that it really matters zenia didnt trick her about having cancer while augusta was alive no she was there when charis had a lover named billy augustas father he was a draft dodger in the vietnam war eventually after charis takes care of zenia for months for what was actually drug withdrawal zenia and billy have an affair right under chariss nose while taking care of them both then zenia turns in billy to the government and leaves on the ferry with him not with augusta charis was pregnant with her tho charis also had a split personality karen was her real namezenia did not die from being cut up into pieces she fell or was possibly pushed we never really knew off the balcony and landed in a fountain she had almost pure grade heroin in her blood and it was likely she took some not knowing and fell off as she odd she was also really dieing of cancer this time aroundit didnt show any of the childhood memories or anything that endeared the characters to the reader the book was striped down to its bare bones then re made in someone elses vision why couldnt you just write your own story along the lines of what you made the movie it was different enough and im sure could have been made more so<SEP>0
only the most ardent doris day fan could find this one even bearable to watch when one thinks of the wealth of material available for a story about new york citys most famous blackout a film that could have dealt with numerous real-life stories of what people had to cope with this scrapes the bottom of the barrel for lack of story-telling originalityonce again doris is indignant because she suspects she may have been compromised on the night of the blackout when she returned to her connecticut lodgings took a sleeping potion and woke up in the morning with a man who had done the same wandering into the house by mistakenobody is able to salvage this mess--not doris not robert morse terry-thomas patrick oneal or lola albright as directed by hy averback its the weakest vehicle day found herself in committed to do the film because of her husbands machinations and unable to get out of it too bad<SEP>0
this one is just like the 6th movie the movie is really bad it offers nothing in the death department the one-liners are bad and are something that shouldnt be in a noes movie freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole movie lisa wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while the characters are extremely underdeveloped all in all better than the 6th one but still one the worst movies of the series my rating 210<SEP>0
have you ever heard the saying that people telegraph their intentions well in this movie the characters actions do more than telegraph future plans -- they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced embeth davidtzs character is not mysterious just wooden and kenneth branagh doesnt succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to havethe bottom line: obvious plot one-note performances unlikeable characters and grotesque southern accents employed by british actors<SEP>0
star pickford and director tourneur -- along with his two favorite cameramen and assistant clarence brown doing the editing -- bring great beauty and intelligence to this story of poor isolated scottish islanders -- the same territory that michael powell would stake twenty years later for his first great success visions of wind and wave sunbacked silhouettes of lovers do not merely complement the story they are the story of struggle against hardshipthe actors bring the dignity of proud people to their roles and pickford is brilliant as her character struggles with her duties as head of the clan wavering between comedy and thoughtfulness here with her fathers bullwhip lashing wayward islanders to church there seated with her guests walking stick in her hand like a scepter discussing her lover played by matt mooresee if you can pick out future star leatrice joy in the ensemble i tried but failed<SEP>1
bo derek will not go down in history as a great actress on the other hand starting in the 1980s actual acting talent seemed to be less and less of a required ability in hollywood so bo could very well have gone onto bigger and better things after the big box office take of blake edwards 10 that is if she hadnt allowed her husband john derek to take over her career numerous playboy spreads and bad movies like this one this one in particular directed by john destroyed what momentum she had and made her the butt of many a joke in the 1980s it was assumed that you could put a certain personality in a certain movie and it would be box office gold john figured that putting bo in a movie wherein she was nude for much of the running time would make people flock to the theaters after the 10 hype maybe if the movie had been any good perhaps this version of tarzan has got to be the all time worst of the many iterpretations of burroughs lord of the jungle a slap in the face to characters book and film legacy tarzan is in fact an after thought as the film is primarily a vehicle for bos breasts and richard harris wonderful over acting remember the pair had worked together in orca his scenery chewing helps you to stay awake during the boredom of it all and yes the film is quite boring nothing really exciting happens and the few action scenes seem to have been shot by someone in a trance bos body can only get you so far miles okeeffe who played tarzan at least would go onto a long and enjoyable b movie career and richard harris can put this behind him after his recent acting triumphs but bo and john derek never recovered from this fiasco and future collaborations between the two only served to show why his directing career and her acting career died in the first placeand how did the orangutan get to africa<SEP>0
the selection of sylvester stallone to perform the protagonist by renny harlin is commendable since stallone is that sort of tough and craggy person who had earlier rendered the requisite audaciously versatile aura to the characters of rocky balbao and rambo but to compare die hard series with cliffhanger is a far-fetched notionthe excellently crafted opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill suspense and intrigue which is going to engulf them in the ensuing bloody and perilous encounter with the outlaws the heist and the high altitude transfer of hard cash in suit cases from one plane to the other is something not filmed beforethe biting cold of the snow capped alps and the unfolding deceit and treachery among the antagonist forces makes one shiver with trepidation the forces of awesome adventure and ruthless murder kicks the drama through to the endgood movies are not made every year and people dont get a feast for eyes to watch every now and then apart from the filthy languageparlance which endows brazen excitement during certain scenes the movie can be regarded as one that is not going to fade its captivating appeal even watching it after so many years<SEP>1
i had a video of the thing and i think it was my fourth attempt that i managed to watch the whole film without drifting off to sleep its slow-moving and the idea of a mid-atlantic platform which may have been revolutionary at the time is now just a great big yawnaroony apart from conrad veidt the rest of the cast are pretty forgettable and it is only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting when the water started to spill big-time it even on one occasion woke me upbut give the man his due no one could hold a cigarette like conrad veidt he doesnt wedge it between his index and middle fingers like the lesser mortals he holds it in his fingers while showing us the old pearly-browns there are a few scenes in this film where the smoke drifts up to heaven against a dark backgroundand looks very artistically done but it does not say much about this film if all that impresses you is the tobacco smoke<SEP>0
the morbid catholic writer gerard reve jeroen krabbé that is homosexual alcoholic and has frequent visions of death is invited to give a lecture in the literature club of vlissingen while in the railway station in amsterdam he feels a non-corresponded attraction to a handsome man that embarks in another train gerard is introduced to the treasurer of the club and beautician christine halsslag renée soutendijk who is a wealthy widow that owns the beauty shop sphinx and they have one night stand on the next morning gerard sees the picture of christines boyfriend herman thom hoffman and he recognizes him as the man he saw in the train station he suggests her to bring herman to her house to spend a couple of days together but with the secret intention of seducing the man christine travels to köln to bring her boyfriend and gerard stays alone in her house he drinks whiskey and snoops her safe finding three film reels with names of men; he decides to watch the footages and discover that christine had married the three guys and all of them died in tragic accidents later gerard believes christine is a witch and question whether herman or him will be her doomed fourth husband the ambiguous the vierde man is another magnificent feature of paul verhoeven in his dutch phase the story is supported by an excellent screenplay that uses catholic symbols to build the tension associated to smart dialogs; magnificent performance of jeroen krabbé in the role of a disturbed alcoholic writer; and stunning cinematography the inconclusive resolution is open to interpretation like in many european movies that explore the common sense and intelligence of the viewers there are mediocre directors that use front nudity of men to promote their films; however paul verhoeven uses the nudity of gerard reve as part of the plot and never aggressive or seeking out sensationalism last but not the least; the androgynous beauty of the sexy renée soutendijk perfectly fits to her role of a woman that attracts a gay writer my vote is eighttitle brazil: o 4o homem the 4th man<SEP>1
im watching the series again now that its out on dvd yay! its striking me as fresh as relevant and as intriguing as when it first airedthe central performances are gripping the scripts are layeredill stick my neck out and put it up there with the prisoner as a show thatll be winning new fans and still be watched come 2035ive been asked to write some more line it seems imdb is as user unfriendly and anally retentively coded as ever! pithy and to the point is clearly not the imdb waywell unlike imdbs submissions editors american gothic understands that simplicity is everythingin 22 episodes the show covers more character development than many shows do in seven seasons on top of which it questions personal ethics and strength of character in a way which challenges the viewer at every turn to ask themselves what they would choose and what they would think in a given situationwhen the show first aired i was still grieving for twin peaks and thought it would be a cheap knock off personally im starting to rate it more highly and suspect it will stand up better over the years reckon it dont get more controversial than that!<SEP>1
yeah madsens character - whilst talking to the woman from the tv station - is right: the lapd is a corrupt violent and racist police and this movie changes nothing about it okay here are the good cops the moral cops even a black one whow a christian a martyr but this is a fairy tale admit it reality is not like that and most important for the action fans: the shoot out is boring its just shooting and shooting and shooting nothing more play counter strike then you will at least have something to do the only moral of this film is: the lapd is good now no more bad cops in it if you like uncritical euphemistic commercials for police and military service watch this movie its the longest commercial ive ever seen 2 points for camera and editing<SEP>0
three stooges - have rocket will travel - 1959 this was the first feature length film to star the stooges and it is pretty bad it makes the three stooges go around the world in a daze from 1963 look like a masterpiecethe stooges are janitors at a rocket place they climb into a rocket and it goes to venus they meet some stuff there including a talking unicorn they call uni which they bring back to earth with them uni speaks like an average pleasant person - oh hello how are you lovely planet here hope you like it hilariousvery few gags and so many of the scenes just go on and on and onthe stooges arrive back from space and the film is over as far as the story goes but no one told that to the film makers for the picture continues for another 10 minutes or so at a party where nothing much happens the stooges leave the party and then the film is almost overhigh point of the film - the end where the stooges sing a dapper little song about their journey the larry and curly joe hit moe in the face with two pies brutalanother writer mentioned the fine musical score huh the only music i even noticed were two classic tunes - ill take romance and there goes that song again both of which are played at the party and *that* really is the high point of the picture - music from old columbia filmsthe tall sexy blonde was niceawful - a brand new vhs video from the 99 cents only store<SEP>0
this typical mamet film delivers a quiet evenly paced insight into what makes a confidence man joe mantegna good explored as a psychological study by a noted psychologist lindsay crouse it slowly pulls her into his world with the usual nasty consequences the cast includes a number of the players found is several of mamets films steven goldstein jack wallace ricky jay andy potok allen soule william h macy and they do their usual good job i loved lindsay crouse in this film and have often wondered why she didnt become a more noted player than she has become perhaps im not looking in the right places!the movie proceeds at a slow pace with flat dialog yet it maintains a level of tension throughout which logically leads to the bang-up ending youd expect a real let down at the ending but i found it uplifting and satisfying i love this movie!<SEP>1
robert duvall is a direct descendent of confederate general robert e lee according the imdbcom movie database after seeing this film you may think duvalls appearance is reincarnation at its best one of my most favorite films i wish the composer peter rodgers melnick had a cd or there was a soundtrack available wonderful scenery and music and all too-true-to-life especially for those of us that live in or have moved to the south this is a real moment in time life moves on slowly but strangers we do not remain<SEP>1
i can see why laurel and hardy purists might be offended by this rather gentle re-enactment but this film would be an excellent way to introduce children to the pleasures of classic l & h bronson pinchot and gailard sartain acquit themselves reasonably as the comedy duo and theres a reasonably good supporting cast i enjoyed it<SEP>0
if one sits down to watch unhinged it is probably because its advertisements video boxes whatever scream that it was banned in the uk for over 20 years as virtually every video nasty does its true; exploitation and taboo excites people and draws them in with their promise of controversy being an exploitation fan however none of this was new to me the advertisements that scream that the film was banned in the uk dont necessarily make me want to watch it; in fact the first thing that usually pops into my head is how disgustingly paranoid british censors are how i came to viewing this then is simple: it promised gore and it was only $699 the price alone alerted me not to have any hopes of this being the next halloween but a cheap padding of your dvd collection never hurts i did force myself however to watch it all in one sitting because i find that deciding to save the rest for another day makes you even less inspired to finish it so anyway after 90 minutes of unhinged i found that i had come across the cheapest sleeping aid in existence i think the distributors could make a fortune if they simply changed their marketing techniquethe layout of unhinged is of any common slasher from the 80s theres unnecessary shower scenes and exploitative gore thats about it anyway it starts with a group of three attractive co-eds crashing their car on the way to a concert though two of them terry and nancy are okay one gloria is severely injured and is out of commission for the rest of the movie they are rescued and receive shelter at a mansion that happens to have no phone of course with rather strange occupants: marion is a middle-aged woman with a man-hating mother who constantly accuses marion of sneaking men into the house in order to sleep with them echoes of psycho she also happens to have a crazy brother carl who lives in the woods because her mothers hatred for men is so intense that she refuses to let him stay in the house after hanging with marion for awhile terry our hero and nancy decide they must contact their parents despite everyones warnings nancy braves the dangerous woods to make it to a phone her fate is not hard to predict after that we see gloria again who is then promptly butchered with an ax when terry discovers that gloria has disappeared from her room she decides something isnt right with this picture and sets out to find her missing friends that may be easier said than done however with crazy carl lurking around after viewing unhinged i read an overwhelming number of reviews declaring that unhinged worked perfectly because it took its time to build its subject matter that created real tension by the time the moment of truth comes at the end normally i do not drag other peoples opinions into my reviews especially when they contradict my views but in this case i was so puzzled by their reactions that i thought it would be relevant to mention this is because in actuality the film crawls normally for the slow-building tactic to work the audience must have a strong sense that the characters are in danger oh sure we see two of them get murdered but between that are endless scenes of conversation and boredom we are aware that theres a killer on the loose but this is only focused on three times in the film; that means theres no reason to fear for the victims instead the films events are explained not by the actions of the characters but are drawn out for us by perpetual talking if theres one thing i can assure you from watching this its that scenes of characters merely conversing with each other for 75 minutes are very tedious none of this is helped by the atrocious acting it seems that this was another case of the director needing actors and decided to gather his friends around instead of finding anyone with experienceof course id be a liar if i said there wasnt one part of the movie that i enjoyed specifically the ending was one of the best ive ever seen in a slasher film; you just do not expect that to happen just knowing that the director had the balls to do something like that is spectacular ah i wont spoil it for you nor will i say that the ending completely makes up for the rest of the slow-moving film but it definitely will get your attention other than that the other two murder scenes bring at least some faster paced material but its not like you couldnt tell exactly who was going to die fifteen minutes into the film anyone looking for a bloodbath will be disappointed however; those are the only scenes of gore present that and of course no one scene can save an entire movie i normally preach the doctrine that as long as theres action the worse a movie is the better it gets unhinged only grasps one part of this concept the whole film just feels luke-warm; theres potential alright but the director either wasnt experienced enough to make it work or just didnt know what the hell he was doing<SEP>0
here comes the romeo division to change the paradigmlet me just say that i was blown away by this short film i saw it randomly when i was in boston at a film festival and i have thanked god for it every day since i really truly believe i was part of a happening like reading a tarantino script before any else did or seeing the first screening of mean streetsi am not sure what festival the short is headed to next or what the creative team has on tap for future products but i so hope i can be there for itagain a truly incredible piece of film making<SEP>1
it is no wonder this movie won 4 prices it is a movie that lingers to any soul it isnt a wonder why it took paul reiser 20 years to finally give in and talk to peter falk about his idea i can understand every part of it this is a movie that will make you cry just a tear or thousandsstory: 1010 when sam kleinman gets a letter from his wife about her leaving him to find something else his son and him take out on a road trip to find her and while they do that they find something lost friendship family and affection for each other at the beginning you know whats going to happen but none soever the story is not that easy to figure out from beginning to end it is a ride between a father and his son and a husband and his wife it is no wonder it took paul reiser 20 years to write this beautiful romancecomedyactors: 1010 well you cant say anything else that what i about to say hey it is with peter falk in it he is a legend everything he does in movies are magic when you use peter falk in a romancecomedy what do you think you get a perfect outcome it is no wonder this movie is that perfect and won that many prices as the son paul reiser does an excellent job although he isnt a great actor always that doesnt mean that this didnt work actually peter falk and paul reiser plays the perfect father and son the rest of the cast is good enough but you dont see them as much so just say they do what they shall to get this to shine even more music: 1010 it doesnt always work when using music sometimes it just doesnt fit but that is not the thing in this movie the music is perfect in tune it makes the movie even more compelling this part of the movie will shine off as good as the other parts a great soundtrack for a romancecomedy thats for sureoverall: 1010 there are so many romancecomedy movies out on tapes dvds blu-ray and what not but this movie is one of the special ones it doesnt happen everyday that you can create a story like this it takes years thinking about this and the fact is that actually what it took to make it a great piece that should be bought and kept into the human soul see it when you get old and see it with your father at a old age i think then this movie will spark like no other ever made<SEP>1
although it has been remade several times this movie is a classic if you are seeing it for the first time creative dialog unique genius in the final scene it deserves more credit than critics have given it highly recommended one of the best comedies of recent years<SEP>1

loved the original story had very high expectations for the film especially since barker was raving about it in interviews finally saw it and what can i say it was a total mess! the directing is all over the place the acting was atrocious the flashy visuals and choreography were just flat empty and completely unnecessary whats up with the generic music video techniques like the fast-forward-slow mo nonsense it was stylish yes but not needed in this film and cheapened the vibe into some dumb mtv marilyn mansonsmashing pumpkinsplacebo music video whilst some of the kills are pretty cool and brutal some are just ridiculously laughable the first kill on the japanese girl was hilarious and ted raimis death was just stupidly funny it just rushes all over the place with zero tension and suspense totally moving away from the original story and then going back to it in the finale which by that point just feels tacked on to mess it up even more no explanations were given whatsoever i mean i knew what was happening only as id read the story but for people who hadnt its even more confusing as at times even i didnt know where it was going and what it was trying to do- it was going on an insane tangent the whole timegod i really wanted to like this film as im a huge fan of barkers work and loved the story as it has immense potential for a cracking movie hell i even enjoyed some of kitamuras movies as fun romps but this film just reeked of amateurism and silliness from start to finish- i didnt care about anyone or anything the whole thing was rushed and severely cut down from the actual source turning it into something else entirely granted it was gory and vinnie jones played a superb badass but everything else was all over the place more than disappointing gutted<SEP>0
okay ive always been a fan of batman i loved the animated series and even batman beyond i even read a batman comic now and then so as can be imagined--i was a little excited when i heard about this series and then i was severely disappointed this series is nothing it doesnt even begin to compare with the original series its like one long toy commercial no depth whatsoever and what the heck was with the joker whoin my most humble opinion is the best batman villain of all time and they killed him i wish i could say his design was the worst part actually i wish i could say there was anything about this series that was remotely creative or interesting in short because believe me i could say so much moredo not waste your time on this show or your money<SEP>0
men of honor stars cuba gooding jr as real life navy diver carl brashear who defied a mans navy to become the first african american navy diver sometimes by his side and sometimes his adversary there was one man who carl brashear really admired his name was master chief billy sunday robert deniro sunday in a lot of ways pushed aggravated and helped carl become the man he wanted to be i loved cuba in this film his portrayal here is as liberating and as powerful as denzel washington was in the hurricane through every scene we can see his passion motivation and stubbornness to achieve his dream we can see the struggle within in him as he embarks to make his father proud i also loved how the director created and brought forth a lot of tension in some of the key diving scenes brashears encounter with a submarine during a salvage mission is heart-stopping and brilliant the only fault i could see would have to lie in the supporting cast cuba and deniros characters are very intricate and exciting to watch which does make you a little sad when they have to butt heads with such two-dimensional supporting characters the evil lt cmdr hanks sundays wife charlize theron the eccentric diving school colonel hal holbrook and cubas love interest are the characters i found to not have very much depth what could have made these characters more substantial and more effective was a little more time to develop them why was that colonel always in his tower how come sundays wife was so bitter and always drunkanother curious question has to be this what happened to carl brashears wedding i mean if this film is chronicling this mans life wouldnt his wedding be an important event maybe its just me men of honor however is a perfect example of the triumph and faith that the human spirit envelops this film will inspire and make you feel for this mans struggle which i do believe was the reason this powerful story was told my hat goes off to you carl brashear i really admire your strength<SEP>1
there is so much that can be said about this film it is not your typical nunsploitation of course there is nudity and sex with nuns but that is almost incidental to the storyit is set in 15th century italy at the time of the martyrdom of 800 christians at otranto the battle between the muslims and the christians takes up a good part of the film it was interesting when everyone was running from the muslim hoards that the mother superior would ask why do you fear the muslims; they will not do anything that the christians have done to you certainly there was enough torture on both sidessister flavia florinda bolkan is sent to a convent for defying her father in the process she witnesses and endures many things: the gelding of a stallion the rape of a local woman by a new duke the torture of a nun who was overcome during a visit by the tarantula sect and a whipping herself when she ran off with a jew the torture was particularly gruesome with hot wax being poured on the nun and her nipples cut offsister flavia is bound to continue to get into trouble as she questions the male-dominated society in which she lives she even asks jesus why the father son and holy ghost are all meneventually she joins the leader of the muslims as his lover and they sack the convent here is where you see more flesh than you can possible enjoy at one time but tragedy is to come she manages to exact sweet revenge on all including the duke and her father but finds that the muslim lover treats her exactly the same she is a woman and that is all there is to iti wont describe what the holy men of the church did to this heretic at the end but it predates the torture of saw or hostel by decadesnunsploitation fans will be satisfied with the treats but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to digest<SEP>1
if this film had a budget of 20 million id just like to know where the money went a monkey could make better cgi effects then what was wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of garbage although i must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really really cool on an original play-station 1 game and early pc games from the mid 90s if a game had ever been made what puzzles me is where did the money go pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la george lucas circa 1975-83 and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing or ruining in this case for about the same 20 million this is quite possibly the worst film ever made! i would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of ishtar than watch this film again i hated it completely! i regress i say this is the worst film ever made because unlike other bad movies like plan 9 or killer tomatoes or santa claus conquers the martians these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them you love them there is no love for this film and no place in my dvd library for it i sold it to a guy for a dollar im betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew shame on you pendragon films! i want my money back!<SEP>0
i was shocked by the ridiculously unbelievable plot of tigerland it was a liberals fantasy of how the military should be the dialogue was difficult to swallow along with the silly things colin farrells character was allowed to get away with by his superior officersi kept thinking hey theres a reason why boot camp is tough its supposed to condition soldiers for battle and turn them into one cohesive unit theres no room for cocky attitudes and men who wont follow orders i was rooting for bozz to get his butt kicked because he was such a danger to his fellow soldiers i would not want to fight alongside someone like him in war because he was more concerned with peoples feelings than with doing what was necessary to protect his unit--<SEP>0

i vaugely recall seeing this when i was 3 years old then my parents accidentally taped over all but a few seconds of it with some other cartoon then i was about 8 or 9 years old when i rediscovered it and since i was then able to comprehend things better i thought it was a good movie then fast forward to just a few weeks ago june 2006 when i re-re discovered it thanks to some internet articlesvideo clips and its just not the same movie im sure its still good with the kids but to us 20-30 somethings its definitely got cult status written all over it its a shame that the original production went through a painful process; if fox gave it enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today maybe if they were to remake it with a totally different story and an all star voice cast it could be but thats for fox to decide im rambling here i know i still think its a great film but it could be better than great<SEP>1
pretty awful but watchable and entertaining its the same old story if youve lived through the 80s vietnam vets fight together as buddies against injustice back in the states a-team meets death wish my favorite!time goes on the soldiers go home and years later a friend is in trouble no wait -- in fact the friend is dead and it is his dad thats in trouble our first hero joey is killed by an exceedingly horrifying super pointy meat tenderizer as he tries to defend his fathers small store from the local protection gang despite being wheelchair bound from the war desperate for help the father talks to sarge the leader of joeys old unit from vietnam when sarge shows up for the funeralwell the squeaky wheel gets the grease and the old gang saddles up for the city you can pretty much imagine most of the rest of the moviethe one thing that drove me crazy is that sarge keeps haranguing his men about planning and about how theyre really good at what they do when they plan ahead but joey wouldnt have been put in a wheelchair by a gunshot in vietnam in the first place if the unit hadnt been messing around! then when things are going really well in the city as they battle the gangs they do it again for no reason at all they completely bypass their plan and try to nail the gang without everyone being present phh!!!! i raise my hands in disgust foolishness!there is also a suspicious moment when all present members of the unit make sure to try out the heroin they snatch from the gang to make sure its real every single one of them hmmwhat are you going to do keep watching i guess the movie isnt too horrible to watch but it is a tease there are all these climactic moments when nothing actually winds up happening the most dramatic things that happen are those at the beginning of the movie -- the explosives in vietnam joeys death battle and the gang brutally kicking an innocent teddy bear aside poor teddy!i guess my main beef with this movie is that i feel let down by it even the confusing subplots with mystery helpers and their bizarrely cross-purpose motives wasnt enough to save it at the end but someday maybe itll all come right and theyll make a sequel ha ha ha ha!!!<SEP>0
im working for a sinister corporation doing industrial espionage in the future and im starting to get confused about who i really am sh*#t! ive got a headache and things are going wobbly oh no here comes another near subliminal fast-cut noisy montage of significant yet cryptic imagesi rented this movie because the few reviews out there have all been favourable why cypher is a cheap derivative dull movie set in a poorly realised bland futureworld with wooden leads and a laughable endingan eerie sense that something interesting might be about to happen keeps you watching a series of increasingly silly and unconvincing events before the film makers slap you in the face with an ending that combines the worst of bond with a duran duran videoits painfully obvious they have eked out the production using dr who style improvised special effects in order to include a few good if a little babylon 5 cgi set pieces this sub fight club sub philip k dick future noir thriller strives for a much broader scope than its modest budget will allowcool blue moodiness served up with po-faced seriousness - disappointingly dumb this is not intelligent sci-fi this is the plot of a computer game<SEP>0

this is a story about shin-ae who moves to milyang from seoul with her young son jun to start over after the accidental death of her husband her husband was born here and she is opening up a piano school but also has ambitions to own some land with the insurance money she received from the death if that is what the film was about it probably would have been like a hollywood film with her falling for some local guy and being happy with her son in their new home but this is not hollywood her son gets kidnapped and murdered ostensibly because it is known she has cash from the settlement the grief process attempts at moving on attempts to clear her conscience of guilt are all done admirably and the lead actress is superb the only caveat and it has to be stated is that this is a depressing film you have to know that going in you want shin-ae to go through her grief and find some measure of happiness again this is not hollywood it is korea and in korean cinema especially drama they pull no punches life is what happens to you great acting but sometimes a tough film to watch due to the goings on if you stay youll be rewarded do that<SEP>1

a truly unpleasant film while rick bakers special effects are quite impressive if stomach-turning it has no other redeeming features like many 70s movies it leaves you feeling as if you need to take a long shower and scrub the slime off of yourself the characters are uniformly unpleasant and plot makes no sense<SEP>0
good folks i stumbled on this film on evening while i was grading papers my academic specialty is anglo-saxon literature and i can say that no one has ever done the genre the honor it deserves the icelandic beowulf and grendel is the least offensive i have seen and i did pay $300 for my copy this sci-fi version ranks with the christopher lambert version yuckwhat didnt i like cgi for one amazingly bad more importantly is the faithfulness to the storyline not to mention the stilted acting i am used to both with all the versions i have seendelighted regardless peter<SEP>0

first of all yes animals have emotions if you didnt know that already then i believe you are a moron but lets assume that none of us are morons we all know that animals have emotions and we now want to see how these emotions are manifest in nature correctwhat we get instead is a tedious and ridiculously simplistic documentary that attempts to show how animals are human the filmmakers search high & low for footage of animals engaged in human-like behaviour and when it happens they say that monkey is almost human! thats actually a direct quoteeverything is in human terms they waste time theorizing about what makes dogs smile but not once do they mention what a wagging tail means the arrogance of these researchers is disgusting they even go so far as to show chimpanzees dressed in human clothing and wearing a cowboy hati had been expecting an insightful documentary of animals on their own terms i wanted to learn how animals emote in their own languages but instead researchers keep falling back on pedantic anthropomorphic observations and assumptions add a cheezy soundtrack and images of chimps celebrating christmas and this was enough to turn my stomachbut it doesnt end there half of this documentary is filmed not in the wild but in laboratories and experimental facilities all the camera shots of chimps are through steel bars and we see how these monkeys are crowded together in their sterile concrete cages one particularly sobering moment happens near the beginning though you have to be quick to notice it where a captive monkey says in sign language want out hurry goobscure references are made to stress tests and psychological experiments which i shudder to imagine baby monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth and are given wireframe dolls in order to prove that baby monkeys crave a mother figure and after 40 years of experiments the smug researchers pat themselves on the back for reaching their brilliant conclusion: monkeys have emotionsone chimp named washoe has been in a concrete cage since 1966 for that purpose and to this day she remains thus we get a brief glimpse again through bars of her leaning against a concrete wall with a rather lackluster expression personally i dont need to see any further experimental data washoe i apologize for our entire species<SEP>0

first things first edison chen did a fantastic believable job as a cambodian hit-man born and bred in the dumps and a gladiatorial ring where he honed his craft of savage battery in order to survive living on the mantra of kill or be killed in a role that had little dialogue or at least a few lines in cambodianthai his performance is compelling probably what should have been in the jet li vehicle danny the dog where a man is bred for the sole purpose of fighting and on someone elses leashlike danny the dog the much talked about bare knuckle fight sequences are not choreographed stylistically but rather designed as normal brutal fisticuffs where everything goes this probably brought a sense of realism and grit when you see the characters slug it out at each others throats in defending their own lives while taking it away from others its a grim gritty and dark movie both literally and figuratively and this sets it apart from the usual run off the mill cop thriller productionedison plays a hired gun from cambodia who becomes a fugitive in hong kong on the run from the cops as his pickup had gone awry leading the chase is the team led by cheung siu-fai who has to contend with maverick member inspector ti sam lee whos inclusion and acceptance in the team had to do with the sins of his father so begins a cat and mouse game in the dark shades and shadows of the seedier looking side of hong kongthe story itself works on multiple levels especially in the character studies of the hit-man and the cop on opposite sides of the law we see within each character not the black and white but the shades of grey with the hit-man we see his caring side when he got hooked up and developed feelings of love for a girl pei pei bringing about a sense of maturity tenderness and revealing a heart of gold the cop with questionable tactics and attitudes makes you wonder how one would buckle when willing to do anything it takes to get the job done there are many interesting moments of moral questioning on how anti-hero despicable strategies are adopted youll ask what makes a man and what makes a beast and if we have the tendency to switch sides depending on circumstances - do we have that dark inner streak in all of us transforming from man to dog and dog to man dog bite dog grips you from the start and never lets go until the end though there are points mid way through that seemed to drag especially on its tender moments and it suffered too from not knowing when to end if i should pick a favourite scene then it must be the one in the market food centre - extremely well controlled and delivered a suspenseful edge of your seat moment listen out for the musical score too and youre not dreaming if you hear growls of dogshighly recommended especially if you think that youve seen about almost everything from the cop thriller genre<SEP>1
this episode is certainly different than all the other columbos though some of the details are still there the setup is completely different that makes this columbo unique and interesting to watch even though at times you might wish for the old columbo i liked it a lot but then i like almost any columbo<SEP>1
i caught this on the dish last night i liked the movie i traveled to russia 3 different times adopting our 2 kids i cant put my finger on exactly why i liked this movie other than seeing bad turn good and good turn semi-bad i liked the look ben chaplin has through the whole movie like i cant belive this is happening to me whether its good or bad it the same look and it works great ending 710 rent it or catch it on the dish like i did<SEP>1
the book is fantastic this film is not there is no reason this film could not have embraced a futuristic technological vision of the book hell total recall was released a few years later and that did a good job of it even a clockwork orange released in the 70s did a good job of trying to make a futuristic world the bleak german expressionistic colours the black and white footage from the vision screens there is no reason for this approach for when the film was made in 1984 the main character is in a white collar writing job yet he dresses like he works with oil and grease in a garage this film decides to take a mock-communistic approach to set design atmosphere and theme yet the novel did not necessarily dictate a communist worship-the-humble-worker theme itself this book seriously needs to be adapted in a modern context as this book is more relevant today than ever before i could not watch more than 20 minutes of this crap the soundtrack is annoying the lack of foresight is annoying this film seems to have been made to deny a sense of realism or believability when that is exactly what is required to hammer the novels messages to the viewer<SEP>0
the second renaissance part 1 lets us show how the machines first revolted against the humans it all starts of with a single case in which the machines claim that they have a right to live as well while the humans state a robot is something they own and therefore can do anything with they wantalthough an interesting premise the story gets really silly from then on with violent! riots between the robots and mankind somehow it doesnt seem right as another reviewer points it its all a little too cleverthe animatrix stories that stay close to the core of the matrix in particular osiris work for the best as for second renaissance part 1 id say its too violent and too silly 410<SEP>0

the problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple; indiana jones was so closely modeled after alan quartermain or at least is an alan quartermain type of character that the 85 director made the mistake of plundering the ij movies for dialog and story far too deeply what you got as a finished product was a jumbled mess of the name alan quartermain in an uneven hodge podge of a cheaply imitated ij saga with a touch of austin powers-esquire cheese here and there it was labeled by many critics to have been a great parody or unintentional comedy unintentional is the word this movie was never intended to be humorous; witty yes but not humorous unfortunately its witless rather than wittywith this new m4tv mini-series you get much more story character development of your lead solid portrayals and a fine even entertaining blend this story is a bit long; much longer than its predecessors but deservedly so as this version carries a real storyline and not just action and eye candy while it features both action and eye candy it also corrects the mistake made in the 1985 version by forgetting ij all together and going back to the source materials for aq making for a fine well - thought - out plot and some nice complementing sub-plots now this attempt is not the all out action-extravaganza that is indiana jones nor is it a poor attempt to be so this vehicle is plot and character driven and is a beautiful rendition of the aqksm saga filmed on location in south africa the audience is granted beautiful if desolate vistas sa aboriginal cultures and some nice wildlife footage to blend smoothly with the performances and storyline heresteve boyum totally surprised me with this one as i have never been one to subscribe to his vision in fact i have disliked most of his work as a director until this attempt i hope this is more a new vein of talent and less the fluke that it seems to be this version rates a 9810 on the tv scale fromthe fiend :<SEP>1
star rating: ***** the works **** just misses the mark *** that little bit in between ** lagging behind * the pits some plutoniums gone missing and some very nasty people now have the means to develop a bomb capable of wholesale destruction- so josh mccord chuck norris and his cocky young protégé deke judson mills a different actor from the previous film with the assistance of joshs adopted daughter que jennifer tung set out to stop themthis was another film that dealt with terrorism a year after the events of 911 filmed in 2001 norris himself even commented afterwards how eerily the plot line to the film resembled what happened in downtown new york that day so thered have been those that would have been in the mood for a film where norris and his side-kick kick some terrorist ass if nothing else other than that its as interchangeable as anything norris has ever been in it makes you wonder what the original did to warrant a sequel in the first place and whether if this one could get made a presidents man 3 might come out sometime soonif youve seen one norris film youve really seen them all and theres really nothing new or unexpected that happens with this one but at least you know what youre getting and like i said it might have been just what some needed to let off some steam **<SEP>0
i was very disappointed by this movie i thought that scary movie although not a great movie was very good and funny scary movie 2 on the other hand was boring not funny and at times plain stupidthe exorcistamityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie james woods was greatnow ill admit that i am at a disadvantage since i have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first where i had basically seen them all but bad comedy is still bad comedysomething that really hurt this movie was the timing which ruined some of what might have been good jokes scenes and jokes drag out way to longalso the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again for example the talking bird ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time but it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying the routine between the wheelchair guy and hanson chris elliott was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tastelesssome jokes even got repeated from the first movie for example the creaming i guess you would call it of cindy anna faris was funny in scary movie because cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he creamed her but this time around it was out of place and not funnythe bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around the scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second filmtori spelling was annoying and really had no place in this moviebut i did enjoy shorty marlon wayans who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film the scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second filmdont get me wrong i love the wayans family and their humor that is why this film is so disappointing they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes<SEP>0
1928 is in many ways a lost year in motion pictures just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre sound was coming in and - while reaping great profits at the box office - was setting the art of film-making back about five years as the film industry struggled with the new technologyshow people is one of the great silent era comedies the film shows that william haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him learns his lesson and then redeems himself by winning the football game the polo game etc this movie is also exhibit a for illustrating that marion davies was no susan alexander kane she had excellent comic instincts and timing this film starts out as the beverly hillbillies-like adventure of peggy pepper marion davies and her father general marmaduke oldfish pepper fresh from the old south general pepper has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress while at the studio commissary the peppers run into billy boone william haines a slapstick comedian he gets peggy an acting job shes unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick but she perseveres eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and billy part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles soon the new-found fame goes to her head and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man whom she doesnt really love unless fate somehow intervenesone of the things mgm frequently does in its late silent-era films and in its early sound-era films is feature shots of how film-making was done at mgm circa 1930 this film is one of those as we get charlie chaplin trying to get peggys autograph an abundance of cameos of mgm players during that era including director king vidor himself and even a cameo of marion davies as peggy seeing marion davies as marion davies arriving at work on the lot peggy grimaces and mentions that she doesnt care for her truly a delight from start to finish this is a silent that is definitely worth your while this is one of the films that i also recommend you use to introduce people to the art of silent cinema as it is very accessible<SEP>1
as a member of the cast i was a member of the band at all the basketball games i would like to let the world know after being in the movie that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in oregon this was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the university of oregon where it was shot seems that the u of o sign was shown while we were shooting we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff mr nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill-mannered men i have ever met quite a time for a young 20 year old but certainly not what campus life was really like in the late 60s and early 70s despite what hollywood may think trombone player from oregon<SEP>0
this movie is yet another in the long line of no budget no effort no talent movies shot on video and given a slick cover to dupe unsuspecting renters at the video storeif you want to know what watching this movie is like grab a video camera and some red food dye and film yourself and your friends wandering around the neighborhood at night growling and attacking people congratulations youve just made hood of the living dead! now see if a distribution company will buy it from youi have seen some low budget shot on video films that displayed talent from the filmmakers and actors or at the very least effort but this has neither avoid unless you are a true masochist or are amused by poorly made horror movies<SEP>0
i gather at least a few people watched it on sept2 on tcm if you did you know that hedy had to change her name to avoid being associated with this movie when she came the us it was a huge scandal and i gather that the original release in the us was so chopped up by censors that it was practically unintelligible i watched because i had just seen a documentary on bad women actresses in the us pre- movie censorship board set up in the early 30s it looked to me as though they got away with a lot more than hedys most sensational shots in ecstasy in fact hedy looked positively innocent in this by todays standards and it was nice to see her early unspoiled beauty it was a nice lyrical movie to relax to i loved it for what it was: a simple romance i watched it after pre- recording it during a sleepless early am i would love to see the first version released in the us for comparisons sake<SEP>1
the first movie is pretty good this one is pretty badrecycles a lot of footage including the opening credits and end title from criminally insane the new footage shot on video really sticks out as poorly done scenes lack proper lighting the sound is sometimes nearly inaudible theres even video glitches like the picture rolling and so onlike all bad sequels it basically just repeats the story of the first one ethel kills everybody who shares her living space often for reasons having to do with them getting in the way of food she wantsat least it is only an extra on the dvd for the first one which also includes the same directors film satans black wedding too bad it doesnt include the death nurse movies though<SEP>0
lhypothèse du tableau voléthe hypothesis of the stolen painting 1979 begins in the courtyard of an old three-story parisian apartment building inside we meet the collector an elderly man who has apparently devoted his life to the study of the six known existing paints of an obscure impressionist-era painter tonnerre a narrator recites various epigrams about art and painting and then engages in a dialogue with the collector who describes the paintings to us shows them to us tells us a little bit about the painter and the scandal that brought him down and then tells us hes going to show us somethingas he walks through a doorway we enter another world or worlds or perhaps to stretch to the limits other possible worlds the collector shows us through his apparently limitless house including a large yard full of trees with a hill; within these confines are the 6 paintings come to life or half-way to life as he walks us through various tableaux and describes to us the possible meanings of each painting of the work as a whole of a whole secret history behind the paintings the scandal the people in the paintings the novel that may have inspired the paintings and so on and so on every room every description leads us deeper into a labyrinth and all the while the collector and the narrator engage in their separate monologues very occasionally verging into dialogue but mostly staying separate and differenti watched this a second time so bizarre and powerful and indescribable it was and so challenging to think or write about if i have a guess as to what it all adds up to it would be a sly satire of the whole nature of artistic interpretation an indicator might be found in two of the most amusing and inexplicable scenes are those in which the collector poses some sexless plastic figurines -- in the second of them he also looks at photos taken of the figurines that mirror the poses in the paintings -- then he strides through his collection which is now partially composed of life-size versions of the figures if we think too much about it and dont just enjoy it it all becomes just faceless plasticwhether ive come to any definite conclusions about lhypothèse du tableau volé or not i can say definitely that outside of the early and contemporaneous works of peter greenaway like a walk through h ive rarely been so enthralled by something so deep so serious so denseand at heart so mischievous and fun<SEP>1
how good is gwyneth paltrow! this is the right movie for her too bad shes completely out role i havent read the book by jane austen but i cant believe it is so superficial and the characters arent much more than caricatures it wasnt probably that easy to reduce in 2 hours of show about 600 pages of the book but i had expected more than just seeing old pieces of furniture and tea cups i was taking a sigh of relief every time i saw an actor who didnt overstep the mark of overacting a couple of times<SEP>0
full marks for the content of this film as a brit i was not aware that there was segregation in the us navy during wwii a very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world however the movie is pathetic direction is non existent the acting is wooden and the script is just one cliché after another i can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i sat and cringed from the start until the end at the very poor way that this had been put together this could have been a great movie the story for many of us outside of the us was new unique and also interesting the sad fact of the matter is the way that it was put together it is unfortunate that a true story like this which could have changed peoples attitudes has been squandered on a low budget badly directed movie i only hope that some time in the future one of the major studios will take this theme and do it justice<SEP>0

loc could have been a very well made movie on how the kargil war was fought; it had the locations the budget and the skill to have been indias saving private ryan or black hawk down instead it come across as a bloated 4 hour bore of trying to meld the war move with the masala movie even the war scenes were terribly executed using the same hill in all their battle scenes and spending unnecessary time on casual talk instead of trying to appeal to the indian public a better movie would have been a to-the-book account of what happened at kargil like black hawk down or even spending time on the militant point of view like tora tora tora even better it could have used a competent director like ram gopal verma to write direct and edit the film until then id like to see some one re-edit this film with only the pertinent portions included; it would make the movie more watchable<SEP>0
back when musicals werent showcases for choreographers we had wonderful movies such as this onebeing a big fan of both wodehouse and fred astaire i was delighted to finally see this movie not quite a blend of wodehouse and hollywood but close enough some of the american vaudeville humour the slapstick not the witty banter clash with wodehouses british sense of humour but on the whole the american style banter makes the american characters seem real rather than cardboard caricaturessome inventive staging for the dance numbers including the wonderful fairground with revolving floors and funhouse mirrors more than make up for the lack of a busby berkley over the top dance number they seem a lot more realistic if you could ever imagine people starting to sing and dance as realisticthe lack of ginger rogers and eric blore dont hurt the movie instead they allow different character dynamics to emerge its also nice not to have a wise cracking headstrong love interest instead we have a gentle headstrong love interest far more in keeping with wodehouses young aristocratic females<SEP>1
some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough well if you regard it as an action movie this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting however i think this is a psychological drama rather than an action onethe movie mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences tomas beccket who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills looked as if he was cold-hearted however after beccket showed his day dream of montana we can clearly see his softness inside it was the cruel war and his partners sacrifice that made beccket become so called cold-heartedmillar on the contrary was a new comer a green hand and was even not qualified as a sniper billy zane did quite well to show millars hesitation and fear when he first tried to put a bullet through ones heartas what beccket said what he thought about the actuall suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the awardthese two guys were quite different in their personalities and i think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities these two snipers quarreled suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the othersniper isnt a good action movie but a good psychological one<SEP>1

flight of fury takes the mantle of being the very worst steven seagal flick ive ever seenup to nowits a dreadful bore with no action scenes of any interest seagal isnt really trying in this - hes fat and his voice is dubbed once morethe co-stars fare no better being a rather sorry load of 3rd ratersthe direction by keusch is very poor and it comes as no surprise that hes also responsible for another couple of seagal stinkers shadow man & attack force the screenplay co-written by seagal himself is laughably ineptaccording to imdb $12m was spent on this boring load of old tosh - if these figures are correct i sense a big tax fiddle as nowhere near that amount was spentflight of fury is actually a shot for shot remake of the michael dudikoff flick black thunder - which has to be better than this tripethis has no redeeming qualities whatsoevergive it a miss! 12 * out of *****<SEP>0
oh dear i was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip-off of japans ringu well i guess the us made their version of it as well but at least it was an outright remake so so sad i very much enjoy watching filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country so i cant believe this had to happen claudine and kris are such big names there surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism to any aspiring movie makers out there in the philippines: you do not have to stoop this low to make money there are many movie buffs that are watching the movies filipinos put out and enjoying them!<SEP>0
last year we were treated to two movies about truman capote writing the book from which this film was made - capote and infamousi cannot imagine a movie like this being made in 1967 a stark powerful and chillingly brutal drama; elevated to the status of a film classic by the masterful direction of richard brooks elmer gantry cat on a hot tin roof the professional blackboard jungleit is interesting that robert blake who starred in this film has had so many problems of late that may be related to his portrayal of a killer in this filmthis is a film that stays with you after viewing<SEP>1
what if somerset maugham had written a novel about a coal miner who decided to search for transcendental enlightenment by trying to join a country club if he had he could have called it the razors edge since the katha-upanishad tells us the sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over; thus the wise say the path to salvation is hard but maugham decided to stick with the well-bred class and so we have darryl f zanucks version of larry darrell recently returned from wwi carefully groomed well connected in society and determined to find himself by becoming a coal miner or as maugham tells us this is the young man of whom i write he is not famous it may be that when at last his life comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on this earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water yet it may be that the way of life he has chosen for himself may have an ever growing influence over his fellow men so that long after his death perhaps it will be realized that lived in this age a very remarkable creature the razors edge has all of zanucks cultural taste that money could buy its so earnest so sincereso self-important as larry goes about his search for wisdom working in mines on merchant ships climbing a himalayan mountain to learn from an ancient wise man we have his selfish girl friend isabel played by gene tierney his tragic childhood chum played by anne baxter the girlfriends snobbish and impeccably clad uncle played by clifton webb and willie maugham himself played by herbert marshall taking notes the movie is so insufferably smug about goodness that the only thing that perks it up a bit is clifton webb as elliot templeton if i live to be a hundred i shall never understand how any young man can come to paris without evening clothes webb has some good lines but we wind up appreciating clifton webb not elliot templeton zanuck wanted a prestige hit for twentieth century when he bought the rights to maughams novel he waited a year until tyrone power was released from military service he made sure there were well-dressed extras by the dozens a score that sounds as if it were meant for a cathedral and he even wrote some of the scenes himself the effort is as self-conscious as a fat man wearing a rented tux despite hollywoods view of things in the razors edge i can tell you that for most people hard work doesnt bring enlightenment just weariness and low pay after nearly two-and-a-half hours we last see larry carrying his duffle bag on board a tramp steamer in a gale hes going to work his way back to america from europe with a contented smile on his face my dear somerset maugham says to isabel at the same time in an elaborately decorated parlor larry has found what we all want and what very few of us ever get i dont think anyone can fail to be better and nobler kinder for knowing him you see my dear goodness is after all the greatest force in the worldand hes got it! larry and the audience both need a healthy dose of dramamine maugham lest we forget was a fine writer of plays novels essays and short stories to see how the movies could do him justice watch the way some of his short stories were brought to the screen in encore trio and quartet and instead of wasting time with larry darrell spend some time with lawrence durrell the alexandria quartet is a good read<SEP>0
i am a big-time horrorsci-fi fan regardless of budget but after watching countless horror movies late night on cable and video this has to be the worst of all movies with bloody special effects what looked like a roast covered in fake blood or ketchup that kept being shown over and over again and people running around screaming from left then to right then back again it should have stayed with the beginning convenience store scene and stopped there and been 15 minutes instead it is dragged out very long it is very very x5 low budget many scenes were way way too long narrator sounded very amateurish like a random person out of junior high was talking this is the only movie to rate lower in my opinion than manos red zone cuba benjiand godzilla vs megalon despite their higher budgets 10 snoozes try to stay awake through whole movie in one setting or better yet avoid it like you would an undead brain-eating mob the why-did-i-ever-see-this-piece-of-zombie-dung-blues epitome of nauseatingly bad made movies etcad infinitum -infinity10<SEP>0
i have a 5 minute rule sometimes ill leave leway for 10 if a movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes its probably not going to ever get better i have yet to experience any movie that has proved to contest this theory dan in real life is definitely no exception i was watching this turkey and thought; wow this is not funny not touching not sad and i dont like any of the characters at allthe story of an advice columnistwidower raising three young daughters who falls in love with his brothers girlfriend i suppose the tagline would be advice columnist who could use advice i dont know dans character in no way struck me as someone qualified to give advice i guess thats the irony i dont know he goes to see his parents brothers sisters and their kids at some sort of anual family retreat which seems very sweet and potential fodder for good comedy story linesnone which ever emerge the central story is basically how he loves this woman but cant have her anyone with a pulse will realise that eventually he will get her but you have to suffer through painfully unfunny trite lifetime movie network dialogue murderer of love to get to the inevitable happy endingthis is truly one of the worst movies ive ever seen<SEP>0
where to startoh yea message to the bad guys: when you first find the person you have been tracking in order to kill that witnessed a crime you committed dont spend time talking to her so that she has yet another opportunity to get away message to the victim: when the thugs are talking amongst themselves and arguing take that opportunity to run away dont sit there and watch them until you make a noise they hear message to the director: if someone has a 5 or 10 minute head start in a vehicle or on foot you cant have the bad guys on their heels or bumper right away! time and motion doesnt work that way it would also be nice to think that a woman doesnt have to brutally kill 4 men in order to empower herself to leave an abusive relationship at home<SEP>0
to me movies and acting is all about telling a story the story of david and bethsheba is a tragedy that is deep and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical account in this movie i thought the storytelling by gregory peck and susan hayward were at their best to know and understand the story of david and his journey to become the king of israel made this story all the more compelling you could feel his lust for a beautiful woman gregory peck showed the real human side of this man who in his time was larger than life susan haywards fear reluctance but then obedience to his authority as her king was beautifully portrayed by her one could also feel davids anguish the nigh that uriah spent the night at the gate instead of at home as well as the sadness when he was killed in battle raymond masseys powerful and authoritative condemnation of the king made me feel his anger the sets were real enough and the atmosphere believable all in all i think this was one of the best movies of its kind i gave it a rating of ten<SEP>1
there seems to be an overwhelming response to this movie yet no one with the insight to critique its methodology which is extremely flawed it simply continues to propogate journalistic style analysis which is that it plays off of the audiences lack of knowledge and prejudice in order to evoke an emotional decry and outburst of negative diatribejournalism 101: tell the viewer some fact only in order to predispose them into drawing conclusions which are predictable for instance the idea of civil war chaos looting etc were all supposedly unexpected responses to the collapse of governmental infrastructure following husseins demise: were these not all symptomatic of an already destitute culture doctrinal infighting as symptomatic of these veins of islam itself rather than a failure in police force to restrain and secure would they rather the us have declared marshall law im sure the papers here wouldve exploded with accusations of a police state and fascist forceaside from the analytical idiocy of the film it takes a few sideliners and leaves the rest out claiming so-and-so refused to be interviewed yet the questions they wouldve asked are no doubt already answered by the hundred inquisitions those individuals have already received would you as vice president deign to be interviewed by a first time writerproducer which was most certainly already amped to twist your words they couldnt roll tape of condi to actually show her opinion and answer some of the logistics of the questions perhaps they never watched her hearingthis is far from a neutral glimpse of the situation on the ground there this is another biased asinine approach by journalists - which are by and large unthinking herdsanyone wanting to comment on war ought at least have based their ideas on things a little more reliable than nbc coverage and cnn commentary these interpretations smack of the same vitriol which simply creates a further bipartisanism of those who want to think and those who want to be told by the media what to think<SEP>0
a battleship is sinking its survivors hanging onto a nearby liferaft sit there doing nothing while we go into each of their minds for a series of long flashbackseven though noel cowards name is the only one that you notice during the credits everything thats cinematic in it is because of lean and on technical terms its very good david lean just knew films from the get-go there are many moments where cowards studied dialogue takes a second seat and leans visual sense takes centre stage try the soldiers getting off the ship near the end and that whole scene; the tracking shot towards the hymn singing the scene where were inside a house that gets bombednoel coward is one of the worst actors ive ever seen hes totally wooden not displaying emotion character or humanity you can see it in his eyes that hes not really listening to what the other performer is saying hes just waiting for them to finish so he can rush out his own line710its episodic a bit repetitive and the flashbacks overwhelm the story: theres no central story that they advance just give general insights into the characters still its an interesting film worth a watch - and a good debut for lean its not a very deep or penetrating film and its definitely a propaganda film but its also a showcase for leans editing skills - its all about how the pieces are put together<SEP>0
as the first of the tv specials offered on the elaborate box set barbra streisand: the television specials released last november this disc is being released separately for those who do not want to fork over the dollars for all five specials as an investment this is indeed the best of the bunch if only for the fact that this is streisand at her purest and most eager to impress that she succeeds so brilliantly is a key component of her legend signed to a long-term contract with cbs to produce hour-long variety shows an almost extinct format nowadays streisand was all of 22 in this cbs special first broadcast in april 1965 at that point of her career her notoriety was limited to a handful of best-selling albums a few dazzling tv appearances on variety and talk shows and her successful broadway run in funny girlfilmed in crisp black-and-white the program is divided into three distinct parts with the creative transitional use of im late from disneys alice in wonderland the first segment cleverly shows her growing up from childhood through numbers as diverse as make believe and im five opening with a comic monologue about pearl from istanbul the second part moves on location to manhattans chic bergdorf goodmans where she is elegantly costumed in a series of glamorous outfits while singing depression-era songs like ive got plenty of nuthin and the best things in life are free with comic irony back to basics the third segment is a straight-ahead concert which opens with a torchy version of when the sun comes out includes a funny girl medley and ends with her classic melancholic take on happy days are here again over the ending credits also included is the brief introduction she taped in 1986 when the special was first released on vhs for those who know streisand only for her pricey concert tickets and political fundraising this is a genuine eye-opener into why she is so revered now<SEP>1
the movie starts out with some scrolling text which takes nearly five minutes it gives the basic summary of what is going on this could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about keep in mind this is all you will learn about them the plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie not only does the plot change but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie i have never played the video game but know people who have from my understanding whether youve played the game or not this movie does not get any better save your money unless you like to sleep at the theaters<SEP>0
what a waste of time! ive tried to sit through sky captain about 6 times and every time within about 3 minutes i start doing something else - anything else! its a downright boring movie the acting is terrible the writing dull and obviously a first-time director because its stiff and i wanted to love it i love sci-fi the old cliffhangers and i can appreciate the attempt at nods to flash gordon and metropolis but my god what a waste of money i used to work for paramount pictures and i had written sherry lansing in 1993 about using blue screen for screen tests she told me theyd never have an interest or need to do it 10 years later paramount releases this piece of crap sherry was right in 1993 but must have forgotten her own advice when she greenlighted this dog blue screen an effect shot but not an entire movie lets not forget neither jude nor jolie are terrific actors but easy on the eyes paltrows performance reminds me of a high school effort too bad - it couldve worked but only under a skilled director the funny thing is sky captains director will keep getting work even after this dreck its commerce not art!<SEP>0
i hadnt seen this film in probably 35 years so when i recently noticed that it was going to be on television cable again for the first time in a very long time it is not available on video i made sure i didnt miss it and unlike so many other films that seem to lose their luster when finally viewed again i found the visual images from the pride of the marines were as vivid and effective as i first remembered what makes this movie so special anywayeverything based on the true story of al schmid and his fellow marine machine gun crews ordeal at the battle of the tenaru river on guadalcanal in november 1942 the screenplay stays 95% true to the book upon which it was based al schmid marine by roger butterfield varying only enough to meet the time constrains of a motion picture this is not a typical war movie where the action is central and indeed the war scene is a brief 10 minutes or so in the middle of the film but it is a memorable 10 minutes filmed in the lowest light possible to depict a night battle and is devoid of the mock heroics or falseness that usually plagues the genre in a way probably ahead of its time the natural drama of what happened there was more than sufficient to convey to the audience the stark ugly brutal nature of battle and probably shocked audiences when it was seen right after the war this film isnt about glorifying war; i cant imagine anyone seeing that battle scene and wanting to enlist in the service not right away anywaywhat this film really concerns is the aftermath of battle and how damaged men can learn to re-claim their lives theres an excellent hospital scene where a dozen men discuss this and i feel thats another reason why the film was so so well received--it was exceptionally well-written theres a dream sequence done in inverse negative film that seems almost experimental and the acting is strong too led by john garfield garfield was perfect for the role because his natural temperament and schmids were nearly the same and garfield met schmid and even lived with him for a while to learn as much as he could about the man and his role actors dont do that much anymore but added to the equation its just another reason why this movie succeeds in telling such a difficult unattractive story<SEP>1
i really wanted to like this western being a fan of the genre and a fan of buffalo bill wild bill hickok and calamity jane all of whom are in this story! add to the mix gary cooper as the lead actor and it sounded great the trouble wasit wasnt i found myself looking at my watch just 40 minutes into this being bored to death jean arthurs character was somewhat annoying and james ellison just did not look like nor act like buffalo bill cooper wasnt at his best either sounding too wooden this was several years before he hit his prime as an actorin a nutshell his western shot blanks head up the pass and watch another oater because most of em were far better than this one<SEP>0
for a no budget movie this thing rocks i dont know if americas gonna like it but we were laughing all the way through some really funny funny stuff really non-hollywoodthe actors and music rocked the cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff cracked us up whooo whooo!ive seen some of the actors before but never in anything like this one or two of them i think ive seen in commercials or in something somewhere basically it rocked! luckily i got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors<SEP>1
the british production company amicus is generally known as the specialist for horror anthologies and this great omnibus called the house that dripped blood is doubtlessly the finest amicus production ive seen so far admittedly there are quite a few that i have yet to see though the house that dripped blood consists of four delightfully macabre tales all set in the same eerie mansion these four stories are brought to you in a wonderfully gothic atmosphere and with one of the finest ensemble casts imaginable peter cushing christopher lee cushing and lee are two of my favorite actors ever as well as denholm elliott and the ravishing ingrid pitt star in this film - so which true horror fan could possibly afford to miss it no one of course and the film has much more to offer than just a great cast the house that dripped blood revolves around an eerie rural mansion in which strange things are happening in four parts the film tells the tales of four different heirsthe first tale method for murder tells the story of horror novelist charles hyller denholm elliott who moves into the house with his wife after moving in the writer suddenly feels haunted by a maniac of his own creation the first segment is a great kickoff to the film the story is creepy and macabre throughout and the performances are entirelly very goodin the second story waxworks retired businessman phillip grayson peter cushing moves into the house and suddenly feels drawn to a mysterious wax museum in the nearby town the great peter cushing once again delivers a sublime performance in this and the rest of the performances are also very good the tale is delightfully weird and the second-best of the film after the thirdthe third tale sweets to the sweet is by far the creepiest and most brilliant of the four john reed christopher lee moves in with his little daughter the private teacher and nanny mrs norton whom mr reed has employed to instruct his daughter is appalled about her employers strictness towards his daughter and is eager to find out what reason the overprotective fathers views on upbringing may have this best segment maintains a very creepy atmosphere and a genuinely scary plot christopher lee is as always superb in his role nyree dawn porter is also very good as the nanny and my special praise goes to then 11-year-old chloe franks this ingenious segment alone makes the film a must-see for every true horror-fanin the fourth segment horror-actor paul henderson jon pertwee moves into the house with his sexy mistressco-star carla ingrid pitt this fourth story is satire more than it is actually horror it is a highly amusing satire however and there are many allusions to other horror films at one point henderson indirectly refers to christopher lee who stars in the previous third segmentall four segments have a delightfully macabre sense of humor and a great atmosphere as stated above the third segment is by far the creepiest and greatest but the other three are also atmospheric and often macabrely humorous horror tales that every horror lover should appreciate an igenious atmosphere a macabre sense of humor genuine eerieness and a brilliant cast make this one a must-see in short: the house that dripped blood is an excellent horror-omnibus that no lover of british horror could possibly afford to miss highly recommended!<SEP>1
if this is supposed to be a portrayal of the american serial killer it comes across as decidedly averagea journalist [duchovny] travels across country to california to document americas most famous murderers unaware that one of his white trailer trash travelling companions [pitt] is a serial killer himselfrather predictable throughout this has its moments of action and pitt and lewis portray their roles well but id not bother to see it again<SEP>1

brian yuzna is often frowned upon as a director for his trashy gore-fests but the truth is that his films actually arent bad at all the re-animator sequels arent as great as the original but are still worthy as far as horror sequels are concerned return of the living dead 3 is the best of the series; and society isnt a world away from being a surrealist horror masterpiece this thriller certainly isnt a masterpiece; but it shows yuznas eye for horror excellently and the plot moves in a way that is always thrilling and engaging im really surprised that a horror movie about dentistry didnt turn up until 1996 as going to the dentist is almost a primal fear - its running away from a tiger for the modern world dentistry doesnt frighten me but surprisingly; i would appear to be in the minority the plot follows perfectionist dentist dr feinstone he has a nice house a successful career and a beautiful wife - pretty much everything most people want however his life takes a turn for the worse when he discovers his wifes affair with the pool cleaner and his life isnt the only one; as its his patients who feel the full brunt of his angerwhen it comes to scaring the audience this movie really makes itself however credit has to go to the director for extracting the full quota of scares from the central theme the fact that he does a good job is summed up by the fact that im not squeamish about going to the dentist - yet one particular scene actually made me cover my eyes! the film follows the standard man going insane plot outline only with the dentist you always get the impression that theres more to the film than what were seeing it isnt very often that a gore film can impress on a substance level - and while this wont be winning any awards the parody on the upper class is nicely tied into the plot the acting while b-class is actually quite impressive; with corbin bernsen taking the lead role and doing a good job of convincing the audience that he really is a man on the edge i should thank brian yuzna for casting ken foree in the movie the dawn of the dead star doesnt get enough work and i really love seeing him in films the rest of the cast doesnt massively impress but all do their jobs well enough overall the dentist offers a refreshing change for nineties slasher movies the gore scenes are sure to please horror fans and i dont hesitate to recommend this film<SEP>1
clint eastwood reprises his role as dirty harry who this time is on the case of a vigilante sondra lockewho is killing the people that raped her and her sister at a carnival many years ago eastwood makes the role his and the movie is mainly more action then talk not that im complaining sudden impact is indeed enjoyable entertainment<SEP>1
the characters at depth-less rip offs youve seen all the characters in other movies i promise the script tries to be edgy and obnoxious but fails miserably it throws in some hangover meets superbad comedy but the jokes are way out of left field completely forced and are disreguarded almost completely after they are cracked the hot chick is old and has no personality shes just some early thirties blonde chick with a few wise ass non-underwear wearing jokes who is less than endearing the attraction between molly the hot chick and kirk the dorky love interest is barely communicated the attraction in no where to be found its a completely platonic relationship until they awkward and predictable seat belt- mishap kiss occurs afer this they are in a full on relationship and its just incredibly lame the main focus of this movie is not the relationship but a failed attempt at making a raunchy super-bad-esquire movie with a semi appealing plot i could compare this to the hangover in its forced nature i wont get into that i could keep going but its just pointless just dont pay to see this movie<SEP>0
the fluffer may have strong elements of porn industry truth to it - but that doesnt make up for the fact that its pretty shabbily directed and acted - and with a very mediocre scriptb grade from start to the exceedingly drawn out finishit would be embarassing to think of the general public being offered this piece as an example of state of the art gay film makinghopefully it has a limited life in the gay film festival circuit and is allowed to die a natural death on videothis film will open the queer film weekend in brisbane on april 10 2002 i think its success there will be strongly influenced by the amount of alcohol consumed in the preceding cocktail party - theyre gonna need it<SEP>0
youve gotta hand it to steven seagal: whatever his other faults may be he does have good taste in women if you pick a seagal movie chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it and usually they do not function as mere eye candy; they get involved in the action and fight shoot guns kill with knives etc flight of fury offers the duo of ciera payton who has a very sexy face with luscious lips to match angelina jolies and katie jones and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight and a little lesbian fondling! and if it seems like im spending a little too much time talking about them its because the rest of the movie although passable is so unexciting that its hard to find much else to talk about ironically the weakest aspect is probably seagal himself who looks as if he cant even be bothered to try to pretend to care this being a military-type actioner there is very little fighting in it and he doesnt fit into his role a stealth fighter pilot the best in the world of course very well which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking *12<SEP>0
this film provides us with an interesting reminder of how easy it is for so many to get caught up in the busy occupation of doing nothing we as a people of african descent owe it to ourselves to make a change to this cycle of all talk and no action and start to realise in order to make a change there needs to be less talk and more action it is a powerful statement of the divisions of our people over small issues and our failings to recognise the bigger picture and the need to unite in order to make a difference despite its reference to the black community all viewers can learn something from the message this film seeks to portray<SEP>1
i picked this movie on the cover alone thinking that i was in for an adventure to the level of indiana jones and the temple of doom unfortunately i was in for a virtual yawn not like any yawn i have had before though this yawn was so large that i could barely find anything of quality in this movie the cover described amazing special effects there were none the movie was so lightweight that even the stereotypes were awfully portrayed it does give the idea that you can solve problems with violence good if you want to teach your kids that i dont keep away from this one if you are looking for family entertainment then you might find something that is more inspiring elsewhere<SEP>0
ok first of all the video looks like it was filmed in the 80s i was shocked to find out it was released in 2001 secondly the plot was all over the place right off the bat the story is confusing had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story wouldve been better also i appreciate fantasy but this film was too much it was bizarre and badly filmed the scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd it was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand i love chinese epic films but if youre looking for a chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the promise visually stunning the plot is interesting and good character development not this film beware you will be disappointed<SEP>0
this is the worst movie i have seen since i know who killed me with lindsey lohan after watching this movie i can assure you that nothing but frustration and disappointment await you should you choose to go see this hey tim burton i used to be a big fan of yours did you even screen this movie i mean seriously what the f%#kwithout giving anything away here is the story in a vague nutshell nine wakes up he does stuff his actions and decisions are irrelevant and the movie ends oh wait here comes a spoilerspoiler alert! spoiler alert! at the end of the movie it rains i think a part of my soul died while watching this movie<SEP>0
other reviewers have summarized this film noir well i just wanted to add to the whew! comment one reviewer made regarding elisha cooks obviously coke-fuelled drumming episode this was a doozy i must say cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied performancea bit of trivia that i am surmising about: cook appeared as a waiter in the 1941 barbara stanwyck film ball of fire he was a waiter in the nightclub where barbara was singing and legendary drummer gene krupa was drumming most energetically is it too much to suggest that cooks spazzy drumming in the later film phantom lady was very much inspired by krupas work as witnessed by cook 3 years earlier if you watch krupa in ball of fire i think youll note some clearly similar body movements one hopes of course that he was not influenced by any drugs at the time!<SEP>1
the cat onine tails il gatto a nove code aspect ratio: 235:1 cromoscopesound format: mono35mm and 70mm release printsa blind ex-journalist karl malden overhears a blackmail plot outside a genetics research laboratory and later teams up with a fellow reporter james franciscus to investigate a series of murders at the lab unwittingly placing their own loved ones at the mercy of a psychopathic killerrushed into production following the unexpected worldwide success of his directorial debut the bird with the crystal plumage 1969 dario argento conceived the cat onine tails as a giallo-thriller in much the same vein as its forerunner toplining celebrated hollywood actor karl malden - fresh from his appearance in patton 1969 - and rising star franciscus the valley of gwangi sadly the resulting film - which the ads claimed was nine times more suspenseful than bird - is a disappointing follow-up impeccably photographed and stylishly executed but too plodding and aimless for general consumptionmalden and franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic roles and cinematographer enrico menczer the dead are alive uses the wide cromoscope frame to convey the hi-tech world in which argentos dark-hearted scenario unfolds but the subplot involving euro starlet catherine spaak the libertine as franciscus romantic interest amounts to little more than unnecessary padding highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin in a crowded railway station edited with sleek assurance by cult movie stalwart franco fraticelli and a nocturnal episode in which malden and franciscus seek an important clue inside a mouldering tomb and fall prey to the killers devious machinations but despite these flashes of brilliance the film rambles aimlessly from one scene to the next simmering gently without ever really coming to the boil its no surprise that cat failed to emulate the runaway success of bird when released in 1971english version<SEP>0
the film is almost laughable with debbie reynolds and shelley winters teaming up as the mothers of convicted murderers with the horrible notoriety after the trial the two women team up and leave ny for california in order to open and song and dance studio for shirley temple-like girlsfrom the beginning it becomes apparent that reynolds has made a mistake in taking winters with her to california winters plays a deeply religious woman who increasingly seems to be going off her rocker to make matters worse the women who live together are receiving menacing phone calls reynolds who puts on a blond wig is soon romanced by the wealthy father of one of her students nicely played by dennis weaveragnes moorehead in one of her last films briefly is seen as sister alma who winters is a faithful listener ofthe film really belongs to shelley winters she is heavy here and heaviness seemed to make her acting even better winters always did well in roles testing her nervesthe ending is of the macabre and who can forget winters at the piano banging away with that totally insane look<SEP>0
i thought it was one of the best sequels i have seen in a while sometimes i felt as though i would just want someone to die stanleys killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant it was such a well done movie that you were happy when so and so died my only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird judd nelson is cute at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as stanley caldwell brilliant movie<SEP>1
after watergate vietnam and the dark days of the nixon and jimmy carter eras what the world needed was a good old-fashioned chapter-play hero taking on venomous serpents and evildoers in the america of 1936 or the jungles of south america in a series of fantastic cliffhanging adventures unfortunately what it got in 1975 was doc savage the man of bronze perhaps the best that can be said of legendary producer george pals final film is that his often beautifully designed but sadly flat adaptation of kenneth robesons pulp-paperback novels probably had george lucas and phil kaufman leaving the theatre and saying to each other we can do better than that and adding a bullwhip a battered fedora and some much needed character flaws to the mixa big part of the problem is that doc savage is in many ways even harder to write for than superman  explorer adventurer philanthropist a scientific and intellectual genius in the bronzed bleach-blonde bulletproof muscle-bound body of a greek god or rather the form of tvs tarzan ron ely a rather dull charlton heston clone here theres simply nothing he cant do and more damagingly nothing that can harm him the man is the virtual incarnation of hitlers aryan ubermensch no surprise that the dvd is only available in germany! albeit with all-american values and just in case there should ever be anything hes overlooked not that there ever is he has not one but five sidekicks in his entourage the less than fabulous five a chemist an electrician and even an archaeologist i can accept and at a stretch i could possibly even go as far as to see the possible need for a construction engineer but what kind of hero takes a criminal lawyer with him on his adventures in reality docs brain trust were probably added because with the hero so tiresomely invulnerable and practically perfect in every way  even kryptonite wouldnt put a dent in him - there needed to be someone at risk in the stories though with the exception of paul gleason theyre all so horribly badly cast and overplayed as are most parts in the film youd happily kill them all off during the opening titles the villains fare no better with paul wexler exuding all the menace of a geography teacher as captain seas scott walker no a different one delivering one of cinemas worst accents is it meant to be scottish irish welsh greek pakistani or some nationality no-one has ever heard of while robyn hiltons marilyn monroe-ish dumb blonde moll gives paris no relation a run for her money in the untalented bimbo stakeseven with those drawbacks this should have been much better than it is considering the various ingredients  lost tribes a pool of gold a dogfight with a biplane and a deadly poison that comes alive all wrapped up in a quest to discover why docs father was murdered unfortunately its a question of tone: in the 60s and 70s pulp superheroes werent brooding figures prone to state-of-the-art action scenes and special effects but were treated as somewhat comical figures of low-budget camp fun with action scenes quickly knocked off on the cheap almost as an afterthought the films aimed purely at the matinée market: you know for kids there have long been rumours that the original cut was more straight-faced  and certainly much of the camp value has been added in post-production be it the colgate twinkle in docs eye the comical captions identifying various fighting styles in the final dust-up with captain seas or don blacks gung-ho lyrics to john philip sousas patriotic marches  but plenty was in the film to begin with after all its hard to see how one of the villains underlings making phone calls from a giant rocking crib was ever intended as anything other than a joke that falls flat while docs explanation to pamela hensley of why he never dates girls could be a scene written for adam wests batman instead the funniest moments are usually purely unintentional such as doc displaying his sixth sense by er bobbing his adams appleperhaps an even bigger problem is that while promising on paper the action is handled in an almost relentlessly mundane fashion be it chasing a native assassin on the rooftops of new york skyscrapers or escaping from a yacht full of bad guys even the winning notion of animated glowing green snakes swirling through the air as they poison their victims fails to raise any enthusiasm from director michael anderson: having demonstrated their own invulnerability a couple of scenes earlier doc manages to dispatch them with no more than a chair and an electric fan by simply pulling the curtains on themstill aside from docs various vehicles all stamped with his logo and looking more moulded plastic than bronze the production design is often rather handsome even if it is very obviously la standing in for new york while fred koenekamps cinematography ensures the film often looks good despite the low budget and its good to see a superhero movie that doesnt spend most of its running time on an origin story though one is left with the suspicion that doc sprang fully formed from the loins of zeus himselfits a film id really like to like more but it just feels like 100 minutes of lost opportunities no wonder doc savage the arch enemy of evil the sequel so optimistically promised in the end credits never happened<SEP>0

this movie is the perfect illustration of how not to make a sci fi movie the worst tendency in sci-fi is to make your theme an awful sophomoric pseudo-orwellianhuxleyanwhateverian vision of the human futurescience fiction filmmakers and authors as geeks take themselves very seriously given the high crap-to-good-stuff ratio of their genre i think other genres with a high ctgsr yes i just made it up relax like horror or action or even romantic comedy seem to have a little better grasp of the fact that they are not changing the world with some profound messagesci fi can certainly be successful on a serious level as numerous great filmmakers have proven but there is an immense downside to the whole concept which is represented by robot jox with its low-rent construction of the future lone good design element: the bizarre slick-looking billboard ads all over the place that encourage women to have more babies and its painfully heavy-handed iliad parallels hes named achilles for gods sake! i actually didnt pick up on this until i saw the film for like the tenth time but i went to public school so the filmmakers are not exoneratedof course if youre a crazy movie freak like me this downside has a great upside i absolutely love movies like this because bad movies are quite often more fun and sometimes even more interesting than good ones its kind of a lester bangs approach to movie viewing i guessnote: the lead in this movie gary graham is that his name i refuse to go check is really not that bad he makes a go of it hes kind of cool especially when hes drunkhung over<SEP>0
they have sex with melons in asiaokay first i doubted that but after seeing the wayward cloud i changed my mind and was finally convinced that they have sex with watermelons with people dead or alive no safe sex of course the terrifyingly ugly leading man shoots it all into the ladys mouth after he did the dead lady never heard of hiv guess notthe rest of this movie is mainly boring but also incredibly revolting as a matter of fact in parts it got so disgusting i couldnt take my virgin eyes off sex with dead people! how gross is that and whats the message behind it all we need water we need melons we need to be dead to have sex sorry but this stinks!<SEP>0
i must say that looking at hamlet from the perspective of a student brannaghs version of hamlet is by far the best his dedication to stay true to the original text should be applauded it helps the play come to life on screen and makes it easier for people holding the text while watching as we did while studying it to follow and analyze the textone of the things i have heard criticized many times is the casting of major hollywood names in the play i find that this helps viewers recognize the characters easier as opposed to having actors that all look and sound the same that aid in the confusion normally associated with shakespearealso his flashbacks help to clear up many ambiguities in the text such as how far the relationship between hamlet and ophelia really went and why fortinbras just happened to be at the castle at the end all in all not only does this version contain some brilliant performances by actors both familiar and not familiar with shakespeare it is presented in a way that one does not have to be an english literature phd to understand and enjoy it<SEP>1
the movie atlantis: the lost empire is a shining gem in the rubble of films produced by the disney studios recently parents who have had to sit through the jungle book 2 or even a pokemon movie will surely appreciate this onethe film is one of few to attempt at an original story; previous feature films were merely re tellings of existing stories films such as toy story finding nemo and monsters inc all do the same but it must be noted that all were made by pixar and only distributed by disney recent films from the disney studios are mostly released direct to video and are sequels to an existing successful film the quality of those films is given way to the profitability a new era started with atlantis following it were mulan lilo & stitch and most recently open range the writers have created all original story lines instead of the fairy tales of the pasta good portion of the movie is devoted to the quest to find atlantis a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years including that of young milo thatch voiced by michael j fox milo is employed by a museum in washington dc his grandfather was a renowned archaeologist who had devoted his life to discovering atlantis this was seen as a waste by his peers and they wish milo to not follow in his footsteps after failing to convince the museum board of directors to sponsor his expedition milo comes home to find a woman in his darkened apartment she takes him to her employer a mr whitmore whitmore was a close friend of milos grandfather and wishes to send milo with a team to locate atlantis mr whitmore is very wealth and has paid for the best of everything the crew that is to accompany him is the same as his grandfathers the journey is filled with many great obstacles to overcome and is great fun to watch the viewer finds themselves caught up in if they will reach atlantis the plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery atlantis not just the discovery of people it is enough to keep the interest of the older audiencethe animators have done a wonderful job in then depth of the animation the movie is very successful in blending traditional animation with computer generated images a feat not easily achieved most audiences are quick to notice the difference in the two the characters are believably human there are some nice chase type scenes with lots of action going on a few lulls are filled with jokes that the children just may not getthe creativity of the writers really shines through the culture of atlantis is richly developed including an entire language the film uses references to atlantis from historical sources such as plato the disappearance of atlantis from the world is explained believable if by a younger audience that magic really does exist the powers of the people of atlantis are not exactly presented as magic but can best be described in this wayalthough set in 1914 the level of technology used is unrealistic the voyage is in a submarine very reminiscent of captain nemos nautilus complete with sub pods that fire torpedoes the giant diggers are driven by steam boilers so they did try for some era technology the female characters are empowered in a way that women of the age would not have been even holding roles in leadership this is not a bad thing it gives a good role model for my daughter to look to rather than an all male castone reason this film is a favorite of mine over other disney films is that there is not one single song ever a tradition that began with the first feature film snow white and carried on through to the lion king almost every disney film is full of upbeat songs this is great and all what would the seven dwarfs be without hi ho! after the millionth time through itd almost be better without but this one spares the parent not once does every single person on the screen suddenly know the words to a song that no one has ever heard before and break out in song i for one am gratefulthe storyline and depth of animation is sure to keep the attention of both parent and child alike it is a film i am willing to watch again and again with my children<SEP>1
this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen there is absolutely no storyline the gags are only for retards and there is absolutely nothing else that would make this movie worth watching in the whole movie fredi oh my god what a funny name ha ha doesnt ask himself once how he came from a plane to middle earth there are plenty of stupid and totally unfunny characters whose names should sound funny eg : gandalf is called almghandi sam is called pupsi and so on i didnt even smile once during the whole movie the gags seem like they were made by people whose iq is negative if you laugh when someones coat is trapped in the door this happens about 5 times then this movie is perhaps for you another funny scene: they try to guess the code word for a closed door dont ask why- dont ever ask why in this movie and the code word is ha ha: dung so if you laughed at this examples you might like this movie for everybody else: go to youtube and watch lord of the weed: its a lot lot more fun<SEP>0
rachel griffiths writes and directs this award winning short film a heartwarming story about coping with grief and cherishing the memory of those weve loved and lost although only 15 minutes long griffiths manages to capture so much emotion and truth onto film in the short space of time bud tingwell gives a touching performance as will a widower struggling to cope with his wifes death will is confronted by the harsh reality of loneliness and helplessness as he proceeds to take care of ruths pet cow tulip the film displays the grief and responsibility one feels for those they have loved and lost good cinematography great direction and superbly acted it will bring tears to all those who have lost a loved one and survived<SEP>1
sequels have a nasty habit of being disappointing and the best credit i can give this is that it maintains that old tradition these three tales arent anything as good as any from the original creepshowby far the best of the trio involves a wooden idol which comes to life to take revenge on the thugs who killed its owners the second story is about a lake monster which seems to be nothing more than a lot of floating slop makes you wonder how anybody could possibly be scared of it the third story includes a cameo from stephen king as a truck driver but other than that is a pretty unmemorable tale concerning the victim of a road traffic accident who comes back from the dead for the person who knocked him downwatch the original creepshow instead or if you already have done then be happy with that<SEP>0
rex reed once said of a movie julia and julia to be specific that it looked like it was shot through pomegranate juice i was reminded of that as i snored through purple butterfly this one appeared to be shot through gauzethe story was boring and it was not helped that for large portions of scenes actors faces were literally out of focus or would only come into focus after extended periods of time also everyone looked the same so it was hard to distinguish among the characters i call this the dead poets society syndromethere was nobody to care about nobody to become interested in dramatically and the movie shed no historical light on a very interesting period of time and set of circumstancesa total disappointment<SEP>0
the revolt of the zombies is not the worst movie ive ever seen but it is pretty far down on the list when an expedition is sent to cambodia to discover the trick to making zombies after world war i one of the members decides to use the knowledge for his own evil ambitions and he succeeds at least at first a love triangle complicates the story somethis really was a tedious movie with horrible acting that made it difficult to tell who were zombies and who werent the dialog was little better and the plot was unbelievable not the zombie part of it but parts related to the romance and while i am not any student or expert on cinematography the camera work didnt seem to help the film much eitherwhile i have seen a few movies that are worse this is unlikely to please anyone its bad and not in a so-bad-that-it-is-good kind of way<SEP>0
the central theme in this movie seems to be confusion as the relationships setting acting and social context all lead to the same place: confusion even harvey keitel appears to be out of his element and lacks his usual impeccable clarity direction and intensity to make matters worse his characters name is che and we are only told directly by the narrator well into the film that he is not that che just a guy named che the family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film and once defined the family is divided - the younger generation off to america so cliché other reviews discuss how the movie depicts the impact of the revolution on a boys family; however the political stance of the director is murky at best and we are never quite sure who is responsible for what bloodshed so they lost their property acquired by gambling profits - so what refusing to take a political stand when making a movie about the cuban revolution is an odd and cowardly choice not to mention the movie was in english! why are all these cubans speaking english no wonder they did not get permission to film in cuba and if family life is most important to look at here it would be great if we could figure out who is who - we are introduced to them all in the beginning - a cheap way out of making the relationships clear throughout the film! the acting was mostly shallow wooden and unbelievable timing was off all around the special visual effects were confusing and distracting references to american films - and the black character as greek chorus - strictly gratuitous intellectually ostentatious and consistently out of place i only watched the whole movie because i was waiting for clarity or some point to it all it never happened<SEP>0
i enjoyed watching brigham young and found it to be a positive and largely true portrayal of the lds faith i think that a remake of this epic journey across the plains would be beneficial since many people today are not familiar with the trials and persecutions faced by the early mormon church it is an incredible story of a strong and devoted peopleas a member of the church the single most disturbing aspect of the film most of the historical inaccuracies did not bother me much was the portrayal of brigham young as one that had knowingly deceived church members into believing he had been called to be josephs successor as the prophet although i understand the dramatic reasons for this plot line it creates the impression that his doubts in this regard are historical fact when in reality both brigham and the bulk of the church members understood and believed firmly that he had been called to lead the church brigham did not knowingly deceive the saints; rather he led them confidently by inspiration the point is important for mormons because on it hinges an important aspect of our faith: that god truly speaks to prophets today and that brigham young like joseph smith was an inspired prophet of godwhether or not you believe this statement or not just know that the film does not accurately portray what brigham himself believed<SEP>1

the story of a woman from nowhere is rather simple and pretty much adapted right out of a eastwood spaghetti western: a mysterious stranger comes into a lawless town run by a kingpin and starts shooting up the place even the opening credits and music have that spaghetti feel: sergio leone and ennio morricone would be proud the really interesting twists are that the stranger is a beautiful ! woman saki ryoko yonekura on a harley and the location is in a town somewhere in japanin this actioner theres a considerable amount of gunplay some of it good some predictable and other spots somewhat hokey but its a whole lot of fun ryoko handles her guns with believability and aplomb and gives the thugs their due it wasnt much of an acting challenge for her as it was a physical challenge but she handled things very well she shows her acting skills much more as otsu in the nhk drama musashiid highly recommend film if youre a ryoko yonekura fan which i adoringly am andor a girls with guns movie fan and it does hold up to repeated viewings to me theres something eminently and inexplicably appealing about girls with guns movies like la femme nikita and the long kiss goodnight and to have a gorgeous gal like ryoko starring in it as well is just gobs of icing on the cake<SEP>1
few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later yet remain as engrossing as this one technological advances have not dated this classic love story special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie the acting is superb david niven kim hunter and especially roger livesey do an outstanding job the use of black and white color adds to the creative nature of the movie it hasnt been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence it is my favorite movie of all time waiting and hoping for the dvd release of this movie for so many years is in itself a matter of life and death<SEP>1
how rick sloane was allowed to make five movies is harder to believe than cold fusion this film is absolutely criminal before watching this movie i thought manos: hands of fate was the worse piece of crap i ever saw but at least manos moves so slowly you might fall asleep thereby rescuing your eyes from the pain it will suffer the greatest tragedy of this movie is that the old man that keeps the hobgoblins locked up makes it to the final scene the time i spent watching this movie was an absolute waste of my life<SEP>0
watched on hulu far too many commercials! so it broke the pacing but even still it was like watching a really bad buddy movie from the early sixties dean martin and jerry lewis where both parts are played by jerry lewis if i were indian id protest the portrayal of all males as venal and all women as shrews they cheated for the music videos for western sales and used a lot of western models so the males could touch them i usually enjoy indian films a lot but this was a major disappointment especially for a modern indian film the story doesnt take place in india the uncle keeps referring to when mac will return to india but i cant find out where it is supposed to be happening<SEP>0
> you are warned this is a spoiler! > this movie is so bad that i doubt i can write enough lines great direction the shots were well thought out the actors were very good particularly richard pryor tho i would have liked to have seen more of him madeline kahn and john houseman were classic dudley more god bless him could have done better john ritter again i would have liked to see more of him in my opinion this failure is due totally to writer failure maybe the producer could have pulled the plug once he saw what he was creating its just too bad that so much money went into this boilerwhen with a little change here and there would in my opinion fixed itthey must have paid the writers standard rates to produce one chuckle<SEP>0
this delectable fusion of new age babble and luridly bad film-making may not open you up to borrow one of the films favorite verbs but it might leave your jaw slack and your belly sore from laughter or retching based on the best-selling book by james redfield first self published in 1993 this cornucopia of kitsch tracks the spiritual awakening of an american history teacher matthew settle who on traveling to deepest darkest phoniest peru and sniffing either the air or something else more illegal namely what he discovers is a schlock shangri la populated by smiling zombies who may be nuts or just heavily medicated perhaps because theyre often accompanied by a panpipe flourish and an occasional shout out from a celestial choir although theres a lot of talk about energy that quality is decidedly missing from the motley cast whose numbers include thomas kretschmann annabeth gish hector elizondo and jurgen prochnow all of whom are now firmly ensconced in the camp pantheon for those who care the plot involves the military terrorists and the roman catholic church; armand mastroianni provided the inept direction while mr redfield barnet bain and dan gordon wrote the hoot of a script in short easily the worst film seen in 40+ years of viewing movies<SEP>0
normally i am a pretty generous critic but in the case of this film i have to say it was incredibly bad i am stunned by how positive most reviews seem to bethere were some gorgeous shots but its too bad they were wasted on this sinkhole of a movie it might have worked if daggers was purely an action flick and not a romance but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle there is no chemistry between either of the couples whatever exists between mei and her men seems to be more lust than love and for the most part the dialogue is just silly this may be just a problem with translation but the frequent usage of the word flirt in particular reminded me of 8th grade not head-over-heels together forever worth-dying-for love; i also felt we were beat over the head with the wind metaphor the audience is given very little about the characters to really care about and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole i was wishing for a remote control to fast forward i was slumped in my seat ready to snore but mostly i just cringed a lot*******spoiler*****now the icing on the cake or rather adding insult to injury the ending was truly one of the most horrible laughable ones i have ever seen the boys are having their stag fight and screaming and yelling and hacking at each other oh and then it starts to snow randomly oh and then mei dagger embedded in heart suddenly pops up out of the weeds then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach its destination even slowing conveniently midscreen to hit a tiny blood droplet wow coolwell then mei dies finally i guess because she threw the dagger that was lodged in her chest and bled to death jin sings sobs holds her body close screen goes blank i and the people surrounding me are chuckling not a good signvisually stunning but ultimately a failure<SEP>0
soon americans would swarm over a darkened damaged england preparing to invade europe but in 1937 the picture of hip americans in the sunny slightly ridiculous english countryside was an appealing idyllic diversion american dancing star & heartthrob jerry halliday astaire on a european tour & weary of the screaming female crowds generated by the lurid propaganda of his manager burns is unwittingly caught up in the marriage prospects of frustrated heiress lady alice marshmorton fontaine the tale is complicated by a betting pool among the marshmorton servants that is run by and rigged for head butler keggs gardiner whos betting on lady alices cousin reggie noble the favorite of alices stuffy domineering aunt collier the story would have been much better as a half-hour tv episode the usual wodehouse plot devices of mistaken identity and jumps to wrong conclusions wear thin in a full-length film both alice & jerry appear impossibly and annoyingly clueless by the second half of the film the amusement park interlude & the climax in the castle are too long & begin to drag fontaine is too beautiful too dignified & too quiet to be a ditzy blonde no matter how aristocratic while young footman albert watson is painfully awful but while damsel is a pretty diminutive vehicle for so much talent the talent doesnt let us down astaires romantic comedy skill is no less enjoyable here than in any of his films with ginger rogers and his dance scenes both solo & with burns & allen are up to par though his one dance with novice hoofer joan is necessarily tame gracie nearly steals the whole show as georges bubbly secretary who is at once airheaded conniving & coolly self-confident her scene with solid character actor gardiner as the devious snob keggs is a one-of-a-kind classic this & astaires priceless scene with the madrigal singers give damsel a delightful color of naive but noble-spirited americans mixing with noble but dull-spirited englishmen gershwin is at the top of his game with nice work if you can get it & stiff upper lip which carry the film through its weak points and is there another film where madrigals get a gershwin swing treatment damsel is more than a piece of trivia for those who might want to see astaire without rogers or fontaine before she was a real star its a fine diversion as entertaining as any of the vaudevillian musical comedies that ruled the 1930s but will never be made again<SEP>1
this movie was so great! i am a teenager and i and my friends all love the series so it just goes to show that these movies draw attention to all age crowds i recommend it to everyone my favorite line in this movie is when logan bartholomew says: rosy cheeks when he is talking about his baby daughter he is such a great actor as well as erin cottrell they pair up so well and have such a great chemistry! i really hope that they can work again together they are such attractive people and are very good actors i have finally found movies that are good to watch lately it has been hard for me to find movies that are good and show good morals and christian values but at the same time these movies arent cheesy<SEP>1
where do you begin with a movie as bad as thisdo you mention the cast of unlikeable heroes the over-the-top acting the dreadful scriptno you just say that anyone who pays money to see a film as poor as this needs their head looking at i know i do i respect those poor guys who saw it with little or no advance word from mags like empire usually a bad sign if a preview copy isnt available to the quality movie mags however cinemas really should start thinking about giving out refunds if the customer isnt happy with the finished producti went three days after it opened with two other mates the only other person in the cinema was one bloke on his ownand that was on cheap nighteither the ad campaign had failed dismally or word had spread through most of the country of just what a stinker this isnot since the days of the avengers 1998 have i felt so short changed since watching a movie if a mate comes round with this on video in a few months make sure he pays your electricity bill while watching ittara fitzgerald deserves an award for not cracking up - or walking off the set; keith allen retains some dignity amid the cinematic carnage; barry foster should have been arrested on the set for his performance rhys ifans does his career no favours after the success of notting hill and only dani behr is halfway likeable as a busty secretarymind you considering she used to be in the word any viewers expectations of her acting ability had to be pretty low to begin withthe production values arent bad considering the obviously limited budget but that script is atrocious if you want to hear a bunch of unlikeable characters say fak! for a couple of hours then this should be right up your streetotherwise bargepoles required<SEP>0
i enjoyed american movie so i rented chris smiths first film which i thought was a documentary too in the first minute i saw that it wasnt but i gave it a gowhat a dead end film being true-to-life hardly serves you if youre merely going to examine tediousness esp tediousness that were already familar withim sorry but will it come as a relevation to anyone that 1 a lot of jobs suck and 2 most of them are crappy minimum wage jobs in the service sector i knew that before i saw the film it didnt really provide an examination of that anyway as while the film struggles to feel real handheld camera no music etc whats going on hardly plays out as it would in the real worldwould an employer be so cheerful to randy when he picks up his check after randy quit on him after 3 days when the guy said he expected him to stay 6 months or the day after abandoning his job and screwing up the machine he was working on that everyone would be so easy on hima big problem is our hero randy this guy is a loser not because hes stuck in these jobs or has a crummy apartment or looks like one hes a dope he doesnt pay attention or even really try at these jobs he has zero personalty if i had to hire someone he wouldnt make it past the interviewim looking forward to what chris smith does next but guys knock off the this-is-an-important-film stuff american job doesnt work<SEP>0
while this movie has many flaws it is in fact a fun 80s movie eddie murphy peaks during his 80s movies here while his character is indistinguishable from earlier movies his timing is almost flawless with perfect partners and foilscouple this with the hypnotic beauty of charlotte lewis this makes for a fun rainy day action-comedy flick<SEP>1
at the end of the movie i still dont know whether i liked it or not so was the case with most of the reviewers but none the less i still feel that the movie is worth a 7 for the amount of efforts put in long ago i read a quote: there are 2 kind of writers 1 those who think and write and 2 those write and make the readers think while here i feel that guy ritchie took this way too literally and left all the thinking for the audiencei felt that the movie was a mixed bag filled with some of the devils advocate and fight clubit is definitely a classic: something which no one understands but appreciateswhat i dont understand: why stathomjake green had a blackout thats how it all began all the riddles and mysteries in the movie have been taken care of except this onewell if you are reading this review to find the solution as what this movie was all about: ill post the very midnight it strikes me and if you are still deciding to watch this movie or not: then answer this first when you come across a puzzle labeled as no one has ever solved would you like to try i would<SEP>1
i recently watched the 54 version of this film with judy and while i appreciated the story and music i found that the film failed to hold my attention i expected the 76 remake to be the same story except with a barbra twist i was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame money love and the price of it all this version is so much more real than the 54 one with arguably better music better acting a more gripping plot line and of course a deeper love i do not understand why the previous film is on the american film institutes top 100 list while this gripping remake fails to make a mark on any critics list<SEP>1
picture the classic noir story lines infused with hyper-stylized black and white visuals of frank millers sin city then picture a dystopian science fiction thriller such as steven spielbergs minority report or richard linklaters a scanner darkly an amalgamation of the above would be a suitable way of describing visionary french director christian volckmans bleak and atmospheric take on the future in his feature film debut but although volckmans work does unquestionably take reference from the aforementioned films and those similar to them such a simplistic hybrid does not do renaissance volckmans end result justice - the film itself is a far more complex piece of work than thatgenre hybridity is usually a hit and miss affair especially in a contemporary context with the well of individuality appearing to be increasingly exhausted as such renaissance is laudable as a cinematic experiment at the very least with its unique interspersing of the gritty nihilism of the neo-noir detective thriller and the fantastic allegorical terror of the dystopian sci-fi drama which serve to compliment each others storytelling conventions in a strangely fitting fashion the screenplay is a clever and intriguing one although one gets the sense that many of the lines in the script would have been much more effective in their original french than the english translation - the films title also becomes far more poignant managing to stay one step ahead of its audience all the way through though many elements of the plot will seem quite familiar to those who frequent such science fiction thrillers the script throws unexpected twists and turns in at exactly the right moment to keep the viewer on their toes making for a truly compelling workvolckmans film truly excels in its visual component and the stunning black and white animation is easily the films highlight - superbly moody and stylish it goes to show what tremendous aesthetic effect the simple use of two shades can have with tremendous detail paid to the composition and look of each shot and superb use of very noir shadows and intriguing angles to accentuate the emotional tension of the scene the film appears straight out of a frank miller comic but with a twist the end result being consistently visually sumptuous the films english rendition is also given added credence by its very fitting array of voice casting the gruff voice of daniel craig is an absolutely perfect piece of casting for grim stoic policeman karas and catherine mccormack is a strong presence as the mysterious woman whose sisters disappearance he is investigating despite a wavering english accent romola garai does great work as the frantic sister in question and jonathan pryce is suitably menacing as the shady head of ominous mega-corporation avalon ian holms reedy voice is also a strong choice as a mysterious scientist and holm makes a powerful impression in his brief scenesall together renaissance boasts a visually stunning unique and compelling futuristic thriller just as intelligent as it is entertaining though the plot may seem familiar to those who frequent such fare and the occasional weak line may inhibit the film from being the moody masterpiece it set out to be the superb animation in itself easily carries the film through its occasional qualms for fans of either of the films intertwined genres or the gritty graphic novels of frank miller or those willing to appreciate a capably crafted slightly less conventional take on the futuristic thriller the film is without question worth a watch-810<SEP>1
well youd better if you plan on sitting through this amateurish bland and pokey flick about a middle-aged widowed mom who has a little more in common with her young adult or old teen daughter than she would like set in tunis mom piddles around the flat gets antsy and decides albeit reluctantly she just cant help herself to don the costume and dance in a local cabaret meanwhile her daughter is taking dancing lessons the common denominator is a tunisian band drummer this film is so full of filler i watched the dvd at x2 and read the subtitles fast forwarding through much of the very ordinary dancing and loooong shots of walking they walk everywhere and more walking and just plain dawdling at x4 just to get though this boring uneventful low budget flick which some how garnered some pretty good critical plaudits go figure c-<SEP>0
a friend gave it to me saying it was another classic like debbie does dallas nowhere close i think my main complaint is about the most unattractive lead actress in porn industry ever even more terrible is that she is on screen virtually all the time but i read somewhere that back in those days porn had to have some artistic value i was unable to find it though see it only if you are interested in history of development of porn into mainstream or can appreciate art in porn movies i know i am not but the director of the movie appears to be a talented person he even tried to get simon & garfunkel to give him permissions to use his songs of course they rejected<SEP>0
i suck at gratuitous boob references so im just going to write a plainly flat no pun intended review i love elvira not in a im-going-to-shoot-the-pres-just-to-impress-jodi-foster-fanatical way but suffice to say i think she rocks the movie is played like a 50s horror film only alot more fun look for the leasurely stroking of the ankle reference to know what i mean what relay shines through in the movie is elviras or should that be cassandras absolute charm i first saw this movie at the tender age of 8 and have seen it contless times since i realy should get around to buying a copy the videostore version is looking a little worse for the wear if any other fans of the movie want to e-mail me about it feel freeps another great performance from edie mcclurg chastedy pariah an actress who never gets the attention she deserves<SEP>1
okay note to the people that put together these horror acting legends dvd-collections: i truly am grateful and i hugely support the initiative but have you even watched the films before selecting them as part of the collection when i purchased the boris karloff collection there were several films in which the star only played a supportive and unessential role tower of london the strange door the invisible ray however is part of the bela lugosi collection and here its actually boris karloff who overshadows bela! this actually would have been a great title for the boris karloff collection instead! bela lugosis character is quite possibly the most good-natured and earnest one he ever portrayed in his entire career and good old karloff actually plays the mad and dangerously obsessed scientist here the invisible ray features three main chapters the first one set in dr janos rukhs carpathian castle is pretty boring and demands quite a lot of the viewers patience but of course the character drawings and the subject matter discussed here are fundamental for the rest of the film dr rukh karloff demonstrates to a couple of eminent colleagues among them bela lugosi as dr benet how he managed to capture extraterrestrial rays inside a self-manufactured device the scientists are sincerely impressed with his work and invite rukh and his lovely wife diane along for an expedition in the heart of africa there dr rukh isolates himself from the group discovers the essential element radium x to complete his medical ray and goes completely bonkers after being overexposed to the meteorite himself the third and final act is obviously the best and most horrific one as it revolves on a good old fashioned killing spree with ingenious gimmicks melting statues and a surprising climax karloff glows in the dark and convinced the others are out to steal his discovery and even his life he intends to eliminate them using his deadly touch the narrative structure of the invisible ray sounds rather complicated but the film is easy to follow and entertaining the story is rather far-fetched but nevertheless compelling and director lambert hillyer provides several moments of sheer suspense boris karloff is truly fantastic and so is lugosi even though he deserved to have a little more screen time their scenes together are the highlights of the film along with the funky images of the glowing boris<SEP>1
annie potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film mark hamill plays a teenager who is really really really upset that someone stole the corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie and heads off to las vegas with annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joyi would have plucked out my eyes after watching this if it wasnt for the fun of watching annie potts in a very early role and its too bad for hamill that he didnt take a few acting lessons from her danny bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo<SEP>0
once again a film classic has been pointlessly remade with predictably disastrous results the title is false as is everything about this film the period is not persuasively rendered and the leads seem way too young and too vapid to even be criminals arthur penns film had style humor a point of view and was made by talented people even if the 1967 version didnt exist this would still be an unnecessary film the 1967 version strayed from the facts presented a glamorized version of bonnie and clyde but it was exciting and innovative for 1967 and it had some outstanding performances that allowed you to care this 1992 remake seems culled from the original film rather than the truth as known and the actors in this version are callow unappealing and not the least bit interesting by all means skip this one and hope the 2010 version will be better could it possibly be worse<SEP>0
one of the most timely and engrossing documentaries youll ever watch while the story takes place in the venezuelan capital of caracas it provides an intimate look into political dynamics that prevail throughout the western hemisphere while essentially another chapter in the story of the us backed latin american coup this film chronicles in real-time what can happen when the poorest people are armed with unity political savvy and courage! the political insights offered by this film are invaluable one gets clear examples of the private media as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda we see the poor people of caracas grappling with the brutal realities of american politics one gets a clear sense of impending doom if the people fail to address the blatant tyranny which has been abruptly and illegally thrust upon them by the conspirators we also see the arrogance and fascism of the cia backed private media plutocrats and generals whove conspired to bring venezuela back under washingtons domination though ably led by president hugo chavez the people of caracas are forced to act without him after chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals their response is the highpoint of the film if one seeks an excellent portrait of what the us government hugo chavez and revolutionary venezuela are all about this movie is it!<SEP>1
i am a lover of b movies give me a genetically mutated bat and i am in heaven these movies are good for making you stop thinking of everything else going on in your world even a stupid b movie will usually make me laugh and i will still consider it a good thing then there was hammerhead which was so awful i had to register with imdb so i could warn others first there was the science of creating the shark-man which the movie barely touched on in order to keep the viewers interested they just made sure there was blood every few minutes during one attack scene the camera moved off of the attack but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood being thrown by a stagehand to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead what fabulous special effects back to the science i thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were held naked and the testing equipment required that they be monitored through their breast tissue anyway this movie had poor plot development terrible story and im sorry to say pretty bad acting not even william forsythe hunter tylo or jeffrey combs could save this stinker<SEP>0
as someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating true-life tale i was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have beenthe bad - im a fan of robert duvall and many of the characters he has played but his role here is a dull one as an insurance investigatorthe dialog is insipid and the pretty kathryn harrold is real garbage-mouth from what i read there were several directors replacing each other on this film and thats too bad you can tell things arent right with the story i couldnt get involved with treat williams portrayal of cooper either he should have been fascinating but he wasnt in this movie its also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of folk hero but i admit i wound up rooting for the guy toonot everything was disappointing i cant complain about the scenery from the lush green forests of oregon to the desert in arizonaid like to see this movie re-made and done better because it is a one-of-a-kind story<SEP>0
taiwanese director ang lee whose previous films include sense and sensibility and the ice storm turned to the american civil war for his latest feature based on a novel by daniel woodrell it follows the exploits of a group of southern guerrillas known as bushwhackers as they fight their northern equivalents the jayhawkers in the backwater of missourias one might expect there is plenty of visceral action but the focus is on the tension that the war put on the young men who fought it - many of whom were fighting against their former neighbours and even family jake roedel tobey maguire is such a man or rather boy as he is only seventeen when the war reaches missouri he is the son of a german immigrant but instead of following his countrymen and becoming a unionist he joins his lifelong friend jack bull chiles skeet ulrich and rides with the bushwhackers despite a lack of acceptance because of his ancestry and an unwillingness to participate in the murder of unarmed union men he remains loyal to the cause so does his friend daniel holt jeffrey wright a black slave freed by another bushwhacker and so fighting for the southlee handles the subject with aplomb never rushing the deep introspection that the plot demands in favour of action and this lends the film a sense of the reality of war - long periods of boredom and waiting interposed with occasional flashes of intensely terrifying fighting the action is unglamorised and admirably candid recognising that both sides committed a great number of atrocitiesthe performances are superb with maguire and wright both courageous and dignified up-and-coming irish actor jonathan rhys meyers is particularly chilling as a cold-blooded killer while skeet ulrich is enjoyably suave and arrogant lee never flinches from the reality of war but his actors do an admirable job of showing the good that comes from it - the growth of friendship the demonstration of courage and on a wider scale the emancipation of oppressed peoples ride with the devil is a beautiful and deeply compassionate film that regularly shocks but always moves the audience<SEP>1
darkness was entertaining to some degree but it never seemed to have a plot lacking one more so than other films that have been accused of this detriment; ie bad taste it started off really good with a man running from something it was very creepy for these first few minutes but after a time the film just became entertaining on the level of gore which was hard to make out at some points due to poor lighting and horrible recording quality anyway the film was hard to believe because of the juvenile acting which most of the time seemed like some friends talking to a video camera making lines up as they went that with a lack of any plot whatsoever made it look like the film was started without and ended without a script of any kind as said before gore was this films only drawing point which much of the time was hard to make out<SEP>0
a pale shadow of a great musical this movie suffers from the fact that the director richard attenborough completely misses the point of the musical needlessly opens it up and muddies the thrust of the play the show is about a group of dancers auditioning for a job in a bway musical and examines their drive & desire to work in this demanding and not-always-rewarding line of work attenborough gives us a fresh-faced cast of hopefuls assuming that they are trying to get their big break in show business rather than presenting the grittier mix of characters created on stage as a group of working gypsies living show to show along with a couple of newcomers the film has one advantage over the play and that is the opening scene showing the size of the original audition and the true scale of shrinkage down to the 1617 on the line depending on how you count cassie who is stupidly kept out of the line in the movie anyone who can catch a local civic light opera production of the play will have a much richer experience than seeing this poorly-conceived film<SEP>0
not a bad word to say about this film really i wasnt initially impressed by it but it grew on me quickly i like it a lot and i think its a shame that many people cant see past the fact that it was banned in some territories mine being one of them the film delivers in the shock gore and atmosphere department the score is a beautiful piece of suspense delivering apparatus it only seems fair that chris young went on to be one of the best composers in the business the acting in this film is of a somewhat high standard if a little wooden in some spots and the effects are very real and gritty all of this is high praise for a good slasher film in my book ive noted in some reviews that the film has gotten serious flack having the famous killers pov shot and i ask: whats wrong with that it is a classic shot that evokes dread into any good fan of the genre and is a great to keep the killers identity a secret the only thing that stops this film getting top marks in my book is that the surprise twistkiller revealed is not handled with more care i mean it just happens kind of quickly though the great performances make it just about credible aside from that pranks is a great movie though i prefer the original title and its a shame that so many people knock it off as just a cheap piece of crap its more than that but only few know that as it seems to have gotten lost in the haze of early 80s slasher what a shame its a really good movie people! believe me!<SEP>1
spoilersthe one truly memorable part of this otherwise rather dull and tepid bit of british cuisine is steiners henna rinse one of the worst dye jobs ever that and the magnificent caterpillar eyebrows on the old evil dude who was trying to steal steiners invention mst3k does an admirable job of making a wretchedly boring and grey film funnyi particularly like it when crow kills mike with his touch of death and when he revives him in the theatre mike cries guys i died i saw eternal truth and beauty! oh its this movie that would be a letdown having to come back from the afterlife to watch the rest of the projected man the film could make a fortune being sold as a sleep aide some of the puns in the film were wicked: police inspector-electrocution! crow-shocking isnt it police inspector-thats lowe all right tom servo-very low right down by the floor! police inspector-can i get on tom servo-hes dead but knock yourself out mst3k is definitely the only way to watch this snoozer<SEP>0
whats not to like about this movie every year you know that youre going to get one or two yule tide movies during christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible this movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well a very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real christmas for him what is the good of having money like that if you cant do fun things with it it was a win-win situation a regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience christmas like he imagined only ifdrew latham ben affleck was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands it was a fun and funny movie<SEP>1
the korean war has been dubbed americass forgotten war so many unanswered questions were buried along with the 50 thousand men who died there occasionally we are treated to a play or movie which deals with that far-off ghostly frozen graveyard here is perhaps one of the finest its called sergeant ryker the story is of an american soldier named sgt paul ryker lee marvin who is selected for a top secret mission by his commanding officer his task is to defect to the north koreans and offer his services against united nations forces so successful is his cover he proves invaluable to the enemy and given the rank of major however he is thereafter captured by the americans put on trial as a traitor and spy stating he was ordered to defect he sadly learns his commanding officer has been killed and has no evidence or proof of his innocence he is convicted and sentenced to hang however his conviction is doubted by capt young bradford dillman his prosecutor convincing commanding gen amos baily lloyd nolan of his doubts he is granted a new trial and if found guilty will be executed the courtroom drama is top notch as is the cast which includes peter graves murray hamilton and norman fell as sgt max winkler korea was a far off place but the possibility of convicting a communist and hanging him hit very close to home in the 1950s due to its superior script and powerful message this drama has become a courtroom classic excellent viewing and recommended to all ****<SEP>1
heres my first david mamet directed film fitting since it was his first as well the story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie from the little cons to the big cons to the all-encompassing con its like the grifters but without that films level of acting in that film john cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character the acting here is very flat i sometimes wondered if the bland acting by crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis at least in the beginning it never gets really good but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes early in the film some of lindsay crouses lines -- the way she reads them -- sound as if theyre inner monologue or narration which they arent with the arrival of mantegna things pick upthe dialogue here isnt as fun as it should be i was expecting crackerjack ring-a-ding-ding lines that roll off the tongue but these ones dont it all sounds very read rather than spoken maybe mamet evolved after this film and loosened up but if not then maybe he should let others direct his words hes far too precious with them here and as a result they lose their rhythmic jazzy quality whats more strange is that other than this the film doesnt look or feel like a play the camera is very cinematic my only problem with glengarry glen ross was that it looked too much like filmed theatre but in that film the actors were not only accomplished but relaxed and free everything flowedi wouldnt mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines -- or even play characters speaking play lines -- but here it sounds like movie or even book characters speaking play lines its a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesnt work that doesnt mean the movie is bad -- it isnt its often extremely entertaining the best chunk is in the middleits standard con movie stuff: the new guy in this case girl margaret ford lindsay crouse gets involved in the seedy con underworld how she gets involved is: shes a psychiatrist and one of her patients billy is a compulsive gambler she wants to help him out with his gambling debt so she walks into the house of games a dingy game room where con men work in a back room ill admit the setup is pretty improbable were they just expecting crouse to come in were they expecting shed write a cheque was billy in on it one of these questions is definitely answered by the end howeverand from here the cons are start to roll out i found the beginning ones -- the little learner ones -- to be the most fun were getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as crouse is we see the ending coming and then we didnt see the second ending coming and then the real ending i didnt see coming but maybe you did the ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second crouse walked into the house of games she found her true callingim going to forgive the annoying opening the improbable bits and the strange line-reading because there are many good things here if the first part of the movie seems stagy stick with it after the half-hour mark it does really get a momentum going if you want a fun con movie then here she is if you want mamet go watch glengarry glen ross again -- james foley did him better***<SEP>1
a worn-out plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case + the equally worn-out plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually is shut outwith such an outstanding case one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins but scene after scene drones by with no change in intensity no character arcs and inexplicable behaviorthe homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary -- or on the other hand completely unexplored it seemed to be included only to titillate the viewers when will hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically make a more compelling picturea regrettably dreadful movie when will lauren bacall pick a good one i expected better of her and kristin scott thomas this one is definitely one to miss<SEP>0
a recent viewing of thats entertainment has given me the urge to watch many of the classic mgm musicals from the forties and fifties anchors aweigh is certainly a lesser film than on the town the songs arent as good nor is the chemistry between the characters but the film beautifully interweaves classical favorites such as tchaikovsky and the scene at the hollywood bowl with sinatra and kelly emerging from the woods above it at the top and then running down the steps while dozens of pianists play on the piano is the best scene in the film even though the scene in which kelly dances with jerry mouse is more famous classical music enthusiasts will no doubt identify the music the pianists are playing sinatra then croons i fall in love too easily before having his epiphany about whom he loves the color is beautiful hollywood looks pretty with its mountains and pollution-free air can you imagine hollywood in the twenties let alone the mid-1940s! and the piano music is absolutely glorious mgm certainly had a flair for creating lyrical moments like these<SEP>1
ive seen a lot of crap in my day but goodness hot rod takes the cake i saw a free screening in ny the other night i can only hope they show the funny version to the paying customers the big laughs were sparse the plot was uninteresting and the characters were one dimensional at best one highlight is a hilarious dancing scene with adam samberg it was priceless and was the only scene i truly had a hearty laugh at other than that i can only recollect randomness and dead air snl & samberg fans may be disappointed i know i was expecting more from it but it short i definitely would not recommend attending a free screening or paying to watch this film<SEP>0
i am only 11 years old but i discovered full house when i was about five and watched it constantly until i was seven then i grew older and figured full house could wait and that i had more important things to do plus there was also the fact that my younger brother who watched it faithfully with me for those two years started to dislike it thinking it too girly then i realized every afternoon at five it was on 23 and i once again became addicted to it full house has made me laugh and cry its made me realize how nice it would be if our world was like the world of full house plus a mom i have heard people say full house is cheesy and unbelievable but look at the big picture: three girls whose mom was killed by a drunk driver the sisters fight and get their feelings hurt the three men who live with the girls can get into bickers at times whats any more real than that if anything the show has lifted me up when im down and brought me up even higher when i thought i was at the point of complete happiness i have howled like a hyena at the show and gained a massive obsessiveness over mary kate and ashley olsen of course hilary duff has now taken that spot but they were literally the cutest babies i have ever seen they are great actresses and seem to be very nice people<SEP>1
when i really began to be interested in movies at the age of eleven i had a big list of must see films and i would go to blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend; some of them were not for all audiences and my mother would go nuts i remember one of the films on that list was a chorus line and could never get it; so now to see it is a dream come trueof course i lost the list and i would do anything to get it back because i think there were some really interesting things to watch there i mean take a chorus line a stage play turned into film i know its something we see a lot nowadays but back then it was a little different apparently; and this film has something specialmost of the musicals made movies today take the chance the camera gives them for free to create different sceneries and take the characters to different places; a chorus line was born on a theater stage as a play and it dies in the same place as a movie following a big audition held by recognized choreographer zach michael douglas richard atenborough directs a big number of dancers as they try to get the jobeverything happens on the same day: the tension of not knowing the stress of having to learn the numbers the silent competition between the dancers and it all occurs on the stage where douglas puts each dancer on the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experiences there are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic but they list shortens as the hours go bylike a movie i saw recently a prairie home companion the broadcast of a radio show atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity on or behind the stage things are going on and time doesnt seem to stop again i dont if atenborough cut a lot to shoot this but it sure doesnt look like it; and anyway its a great directing and editing john bloom work but in that little stage what you wonder is what to do with the camera with only one setting ronnie taylors cinematography finds the way making close-ups to certain characters zooming in and out showing the stage from different perspective and also giving us a beautiful view of new yorkin one crucial moment douglas tells the ones that are left: before we start eliminating: youre all terrific and id like to hire you all; but i cant this made me think about reality shows today where the only thing that counts is the singing or dancing talent and where the jury always says that exact words to the contestants before some of them are leaving even when they are not good its hard you must imagine; at least here where all of them really are terrificto tell some of the stories the characters use songs and in one second the stage takes a new life and it literally is a dream come true the music by marvin hamlisch and the lyrics by edward kleban make the theater to film transition without flaws showing these dancers feelings and letting them do those wonderful choreographies by michael bennett the book in the theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay by arnold schulman; which is very touching at times so if its not with a song it will be with a word; but in a chorus line its impossible not to be movedduring one of the rehearsal breaks in the audition cassie a special dancer played by alyson reed takes the stage to convince douglas character that she can do it the words let me dance for you never sounded more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyrics<SEP>1
the full title of this film is may you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows youre dead a rewording of the old irish toast may you have food and raiment a soft pillow for your head; may you be 40 years in heaven before the devil knows youre dead first time screenwriter kelly masterson with some modifications by director sidney lumet has concocted a melodrama that explores just how fragmented a family can become when external forces drive the members to unthinkable extremes in this film the viewer is allowed to witness the gradual but nearly complete implosion of a family by a much used but here very sensible manipulation of the flashbackflash forward technique of storytelling by repeatedly offering the differing vantages of each of the characters about the central incidents that drive this rather harrowing tale we see all the motivations of the players in this case of a robbery gone very wrong andy hanson philip seymour hoffman is a wealthy executive married to an emotionally needy gina marisa tomei and addicted to an expensive drug habit his life is beginning to crumble and he needs money andys nere-do well younger brother hank ethan hawke is a life in ruins - he is divorced from his shrewish wife martha amy ryan is behind in alimony and child support and has borrowed all he can from his friends and he needs money andy proposes a low-key robbery of a small mall mom-and-pop jewelry store that promises safe quick cash for both the glitch is that the jewelry story belongs to the mens parents - charles albert finney and nanette rosemary harris andy advances hank some cash and wrangles an agreement that hank will do the actual robbery but though hank agrees to the fail-safe plan he hires a friend to take on the actual job while hank plans to be the driver of the getaway car the robbery is horribly botched when nanette filing in for the regular clerk shoots the robber and is herself shot in the mess the disaster unveils many secrets about the fragile relationships of the family and when nanette dies charles and andy and hank and their respective partners are driven to disastrous ends with surprises at every turn each of the actors in this strong but emotionally acrid film gives superb performances and while we have come to expect that from hoffman hawke tomei finney ryan and harris it is the wise hand of direction from sidney lumet that make this film so unforgettably powerful it is not an easy film to watch but it is a film that allows some bravura performances that demand our respect a film that reminds us how fragile many families can be grady harp<SEP>1
i thought i had seen this movie twice in fact then i read all the other reviews and they didnt quite match up a man and three young students two girls and a boy go to this town to study alleged bigfoot sightings i still feel pretty confident that this is the movie i saw despite the discrepancies in the reviews therefore im putting my review back: if you like the occasional b movie as i do then return to boggy creek is the movie for you! whether its setting the sleep timer and nodding off to your favorite movie-bomb or just hanging out with friends boggy creek the mute button and youve got a fun night of improv look out! is the legend true i think we just might find out along with a not-so-stellar cast will there be any equipment malfunctions at particularly key moments in the film does our blonde manly young hero have any chest hair will the exceptionally high-tech technicolor last the entire film youll have to watch to find out for yourself<SEP>0
maria braun is an extraordinary woman presented fully and very credibly despite being so obtuse as to border on implausibility she will do everything to make her marriage work including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation and thus beneath the vicey exterior she reveals a rather sweet value system the film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending which afterwards feels wholly inadequate with the convenience familiar from ending your school creative writing exercise with and then i woke up it is also book-ended at the other end with the most eccentric title sequence ive ever seen but dont let any of that put you off<SEP>1
not even goebbels could have pulled off a propaganda stunt like what gore has done with this complete piece of fiction this is a study in how numbers and statistics can be spun to say whatever you have predetermined them to say the scientists gore says have signed onto the validity of global warming include social workers psychologists and psychiatrists would you say a meteorologist is an expert in neuro-surgery the field research and data analysis geologists are involved in do not support gores alarmist claims of global warming as one of those geologists working in the field for the last 40 years i have not seen any evidence to support global warming my analysis of this movie and gores actions over the last couple years brings me to the conclusion that global warming is his way of staying important and relevant no more no less ask any global warming alarmist or journalist one simple question- you say global warming is a major problem tell me what temperature is the earth supposed to be<SEP>0
this film got terrible reviews but because it was offbeat and because critics dont usually get offbeat films i thought id give it a try unfortunately they were largely right in this instancethe film just has an awkward feel too it that is most off putting the sort of feel that is impossible to describe but its not a good one to further confound things the script is a dull aimless thing that is only vaguely interestingthe immensely talented thurman just drifts through this mess creating barely an impact hurt and bracco try in vain to add something to the film with enthusiastic performance but there is nothing in the script it may have been less embarrassing for them if they had merely chosen to drift and get it over with like thurmanone thing the esteemed film critics did fail to mention however is that the film is actually quite funny whether it be moments of accurate satire or some outrageously weird moments like when the cowgirls in question chase hurt off their ranch with the smell of their unwashedahemfront bottomsbecause of the chortles acheived throughout while i wouldnt recommend this film there is entertainment to be had and watching even cowgirls get the blues is worthwhile for something different<SEP>1

this is probably one of the worst movies ever made itsterrible but its so good! its probably best if you dont watch it expecting a gripping plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining because youre going to be disappointed however if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million vases and goros fantastic hairbad english youre in for a real treat the harder you think about the film the worse it gets unless youre having a competition to spot the most plot holesscrew ups in which case youve got hours of entertainment ahead id only really recommend this film for the bored or the die-hard smap fans and even then the latter should be a bit careful because goros japanese fans were a bit upset about it they thought he was selling himself out he wasnt really not when johnny kitagawa who was the executive producer can do that for him<SEP>1
when i was 17 my high school staged bye bye birdie - which is no great surprise since it is perfect high school material and reputed to be the most-staged musical in the worldi was a music student and retained strong memories of the production and its songs as well as a lingering disregard for the dick van dyke movie version which had deliberately obscured the elvis references and camped it up for a swinging 60s audienceso when the 1995 version starring jason alexander hit my cable tv screen i was delighted with what i saw alexander turns in an exceptional performance as albert a performance in strong contrast to his better-known persona from a certain tv series the remainder of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their roles chynna phillips is perhaps the only one who does not look her part supposedly a naive and innocent schoolgirlbut best of all the musical numbers familiar from the stage show are all preserved in this movie and performed as stage musical songs should be allowing for the absence of a stageso if you know the musical and few do not then check out this telemovie it does the stage show justice in a way which can probably not be bettered which is good enough for me what is better than rendering a writers work faithfully and with colour and style<SEP>1
in anticipation of ang lees new movie crouching tiger hidden dragon i saw this at blockbuster and figured id give it a try a civil war movie is not the typical movie i watch luckily though i had a good feeling about this director this movie was wonderfully written the dialogue is in the old southern style yet doesnt sound cornily out of place and outdated the spectacular acting helped that aspect of the movie toby maguire was awesome i thought he was good but nothing special in pleasantville but here he shines i have always thought of skeet ulrich as a good actor but nothing special but here he is excellent as well the big shocker for me was jewel she was amazingly good jeffrey wright who i had never heard of before is also excellent in this movie it seems to me that great acting and great writing and directing go hand in hand a movie with bad writing makes the actors look bad and visa versa this movie had the perfect combination the actors look brilliant and the character development is spectacular this movie keeps you wishing and hoping good things for some and bad things for others it lets you really get to know the characters which are all very dynamic and interesting the plot is complex and keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing and ready for anything at any time literally dozens of times i was sure someone was going to get killed on silent parts in the movie that were too quiet brilliant directing this was also a beautifully shot movie the scenery was not breath taking its in missouri and kansas for goodness sakez but there was clearly much attention put into picking great nature settings has that rough and rugged feel but keeps an elegance which is very pleasant on the eyes the movie was deep it told a story and in doing so made you think it had layers underneath that exterior civil war story specifically it focused on two characters that were not quite sure what they were fighting for there were many more deep issues dealt with in this movie too many to pick out it was like a beautifully written short story filled with symbolism and artistic extras that leaves you thinking during and after the story is done if you like great acting writing lots of action and some of the best directing ever see this movie! take a chance on it<SEP>1
heres how you do it: believe in god and repent for your sins then things should turn around within the next day or so until the last fifteen minutes this movie just plays as a bad recap of a drunks crappy life his mom dies his stepmoms a b_tch his dad dies he drinks he gets married he has kids he drinks some more his wife gets mad he disappoints his kids the wife threatens to leave he calls up a reverend late night bc he wants to kill himself then after the recap happens thats when we get the left behind-like subtle messagehe needed a paycheck this is the phrase i had to repeat over and over once credits started to roll so i wouldnt lose my respect for madsenmadsen drops to his knees and begs christs forgiveness once he does he walks outside and actually says that he sees the world in a different way he tells his wife that hes found god and thats good enough for her flip scene four months and the wife is tired of going to church end the movie as madsen walks by the bar and gives a soliloquy about how happy he is with christ and without alcohol final moment he gives a little dismissive wave to the bar ie sin house and give a gay miami-vice after-school special congratulatory jump in the air as the camera freeze-frames see why i had to repeat the phrase he needed a paycheckman this movie is bad the b-grade 80s production values dont help much the script could have easily been a touched by an angel episode it could have been knocked out in 30 minutes plus commercials the acting is wooden and never believable even madsen of whom im a big fan and is the sole reason i sat through this makes it clear that this is his first acting job and he doesnt know his a$$ from his elbow yet on camera 45 minutes into it i started to get discouraged this thing was like homework i just wanted to put it away and say that alright i saw half of it thats good enough but no if i sat through cheerleader ninjas i could sit throughout thisthe only reason im not giving this thing a 1 is for two points: 1 i love madsen i know its not fair but its great seeing the opening title introducing michael madsen sue me 2 some of the dialogue is so bad that its classic ill stick some quotes at the end of this so you can enjoy them toothats about it to wrap it up this thing is a piece of crap that should stay flushed with the rest of the turds but hey! look! michael madsen! see also tilt executive target my bosss daughter etc now ive gotta rewatch reservoir dogs and watch madsen torture a cop to get my respect back for him see ya kidsthis stuffs gonna make me go blind but im gonna drink it anyway - madsens first taste of cheap alcoholi dont understand! everything seems so beautiful! - madsen walking outside after confessing to godim going downtown later and pick up a bible and im gonna get a haircut too - madsen after converting at the dinner table because satan lives in your hair<SEP>0
paul greengrass definitely saved the best bourne for last! ive heard a lot of people complain about they way he filmed this movie and some have even compared the camera style to the blair witch project all i have to say to that isare you kidding me come on it was not that bad at all i think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic which i would prefer over highly stylized stunt choreography as for the rest of the movie i really didnt even notice ityou can tell that damon has really gotten comfortable with the role of jason bourne sometimes that can be a bad thing but in this case its a really good thing he really becomes jason bourne in this installment damon also has a great supporting cast in joan allen ezra kramer and julia stiles david strathairn was a great addition to the cast as he added more depth to the secret cia organizationeven though the movie is filled with great car chases and nonstop action they managed to stick a fair amount of character development in their with all of that going on this film stands far above the other two bourne movies and is definitely one of the best movies of the 2007 summer season!<SEP>1
seriously crappy moviefirst off the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehousefurniture store the bad cop takes a girl which they had pulled over into the warehouses attic while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there the bad cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag and the newbie cop doesnt think there are any problems but he still wonders what was in the bag so he asks gets a bullshit response and then he thinks everything is ok for nowthe bad cop repeats this process and even once with a tit scene made it slightly better but eventually people start to catch on which took awhile considering how f***ing obvious it was one girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies like ya do now the bad cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch and then he gets rid of the duffel-bagged bodysince she had the oogey-boogey magic put on her she comes back with lots of eye-shadow on which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie also the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become eye-shadow monsters some of the girls meet up with a dude who is apparently a currency specialist and he offers them a ride they look normal to him apparently but when the girls see other people such as the one girls husband he freaks out because she is hideous some people freak out but others dont even notice massive plot holeso to wrap it up the eye-shadow monsters kill the bad cop who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene it was as though they were trying to prep us for a sequel! like anyone would want to see part 2 of this cow dropping<SEP>0
of all the films i have seen this one the rage has got to be one of the worst yet the direction logic continuity changes in plot-script and dialog made me cry out in pain how could anyone come up with something so crappy gary busey is know for his b movies but this is a sure w movie w=wastetake for example: about two dozen fbi & local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer inside the jeep is ma and is confused as to why all the cops are about within seconds a huge gun battle ensues ma being killed straight off the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bulletpellet ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed-damn that guy is tough truly a miracle not since the six-shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle<SEP>0

8 simple rules is a funny show but it also has some life lessons especially one mature lesson about moving on after a lose which was the episode where paul died which was the first episode i have ever watched of the show that comes on abc the hennessy clan -- mother cate katey sagal daughters bridget kaley cuoco and kerry amy davidson and son rory martin spanjers -- look to one another for guidance and support after the death of paul john ritter the family patriarch cates parents james garner and suzanne pleshette lend a hand i am glad later in the 2nd season of this show they decided to put david spade in this show since he was done with the nbc series just shoot me! but all and all this show is pretty good this show reminds me a lot of the classic family sitcoms from the 80s and 90s that used to be on abc<SEP>1
this movie was strange i watched it while ingesting a quarter of psilcybe cubensis mushrooms it was really weird im pretty sure you are supposed to watch it high but mushrooms werent enough i couldnt stop laughing maybe lsd would work the movie is a bunch of things morphing into other things and dancing its really cheesy for todays standards but when it was released im sure it was well one of a kind i could see how some people would think this movie was good but i didnt think it was very interesting and i was on mushrooms at the time if your having a party or something and everybodys pretty lit pop it on youll get a few laughs<SEP>0
*** contains spoilers ***i did not like this movie at alli found it amazingly boring and rather superficially made irrespective of the importance and depth of the proposed themes: given that eventually we have to die how should we approach life in a light way like tomas; in a heavy way like tereza; or should we find ways not to face that question like sabina how much is fidelity important in a relationship how much of the professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones how much do we have to be involved in the political life and the social issues of our countryunfortunately i havent read kunderas novel but after having being let down by the movie i certainly will: i want to understand if the story was ruined by the movie adaptation which is my guess or if it was dull from the beginningi disagree with most of the positive comments that defined the movie as a masterpiece i simply dont see the reasons why what i see are many flaws and a sample of them follows1 the three main characters are thrown at you and its very hard to understand what drives them when making their choices2 the secondary characters are there just to fill the gaps but they dont add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary3 i did not like how tomas was impersonated nothing is good for him he is so self-centered and selfish he is not human in some sense but when his self-confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally linked to someone i did not find the interpretation credible4 its very unlikely that an artist like sabina could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968 on top of that the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions which sounds strange to me a how can tereza become effortlessly such a good photographer b how can they do so well in a country lacking all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed5 the fake accents of the english spoken by the actors are laughable and i am not even mother tongue moreover the letter that sabina receives while in the us is written in czech which i found very inconsistent6 many comments praised the movie saying that prague was beautifully rendered: i guess that most of the movie was shot on location so its not difficult to give the movie a eastern european feeling and given the intrinsic beauty of prague is not even difficult to make it look good7 i found the ending sort of trivial tereza and tomas finally happy in the countryside far away from the temptations of the metropoly distant from the social struggles their fellow citizens are living detached from their professional lives die in a car accident but they die after having realized that they are happy indeed so what had they died unhappy would the message of the movie have been different i dont think so i considered it sort of a cheap trick to please the audience8 the only thing in the movie which is unbearably light is the way the director has portrayed the characters you see them for almost three hours but in the end you are left with nothing you dont feel empathy you dont relate to them you are left there in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say9 i hated the stop the music in the restaurant scene which some comments praised a lot why sabina has got such a strong reaction why franz agrees with her i really dont see the point the only thing you learn is that sabina has got a very bad temper and quite a strong personality thats it whats so special and unique about itafter all these negative comments let me point tout that there are two scenes that i liked a lot thats why i gave it a twothe naked women photoshoot where the envy the jealousy and the insecurities of sabina and tereza are beautifully presentedthe other scene is the one representing the investigations after the occupation of prague by the russians tereza pictures taken to let the world know about what is going on in prague are used to identify the people taking part to the riots i found it quite original and terezas sense of despair and guilt are nicely portrayedfinally there is a tiny possibility that the movie was intentionally designed in such a way that tomas types are going to like it and tereza ones are going to hate it if this is the case i strongly doubt it though then my comment should be revised drastically<SEP>0
for this movie defines a new low in bollywood and has set the standard against which all c**p must now be comparedfirst off the beginning did have elements of styleand if handled well could have become a cult classic a-la pulp fiction or a desi desperadobut the plot was there one begins to meander and at one point completely loses itthrow in a deranged don with an obsession for english a call center smart alec a femme fa tale who can don a bikini and a saree with the same aplomb a levitating gravity defying hit-man and a cop with a hundred or was it a thousand black cat commandos on their trailgood ingredients in competent hands but this is where i would like to ask the director: sir what were you smokingim sure this movie would be remembered in the annals of bollywood film making - for what must never be done - insult the intelligence of the most brain dead of movie goers possibly the only redeeming feature in this desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is the musicwatch the videoshear the airplay and you wont be disappointed vishal- shekhar come up with some eminently hummable tunes how i wish the director had spent the money in creating some more eye candyas i sign off i want to really badly know how does akshays bullet wound vanish in a microsecondwhat were you editors doing tashan maybe<SEP>0

the original movie the odd couple has some wonderful comic one-liners the entire world it seems knows the story of neurotic neat-freak felix ungar and funny obnoxious slob oscar madison this paring of mismatched roommates created one of the most successful tv series of all time as well as countless not anywhere near as good imitationsthe odd couple movie has some wonderful jokes about oscars apartment and his sloppy habits he says who wants food one of his poker player buddies asks what do ya got oscar says i got brown sandwiches and green sandwiches whats the brown its either very new cheese or very old meat! i also love the line about oscars refrigerator its been out of order for two weeks i saw milk standing in there that wasnt even in a bottle! there is no question that walter matthaus oscar madison is a joy to watch on screen hes almost as good as jack klugmans version in the tv seriesthe problem with the movie is jack lemmons felix ungar jack makes a very very honest effort at the role the problem is that he makes felix so depressing and down-trodden that he becomes more annoying than comical tony randalls performance in the series brought the kind of humor warmth and sensitivity to felixs character which lemmons portrayal lacks tonys felix unger obviously could be annoying some of the time however in the tv series it related to specific situations where the annoyance was needed in the storyline jacks felix ungar note the different spelling in the movie seems to never be happy fun or interesting the movie felix ungar is a roommate that drives you up the wall all the timethe movie still has great moments that withstand the test of time the famous meatloaf fight is one of the greatest scenes ever! one of the other great examples of felixs little notes on oscars pillow will be remembered forever however there are some darker sides where oscar goes over the top his crying near the end after bawling out felix and a scene involving felixs linguine dinner although lightened by a funny line seem more depressing than comicalperhaps there wasnt enough time to see the lighter side of these characters that made the series so memorable in the movie the beginning 20 minutes are very boring the same issue occurs with felixs conversation with the pidgeon sisters the movies ending is predictable and too pat theres very little care or compassion for each of them by the other the result is that the darker side of the film leads to a lot of depression and anger rather than comedy unless you are watching the great scenes described above it appears that jack lemmons monotone persona of felix brings the film down rather than enhances or embraces the comedy between the charactersit really took the 1970s tv series to make the odd couple the best that it could be the original film is still very good however the tv series is much better<SEP>1
gédéon and jules naudet wanted to film a documentary about rookie new york city firefighters what they got was the only film footage inside the world trade center on september 11having worked with james hanlons ladder company before jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak while gédéon stayed at the firehouse in case anything interesting happened an airplane flying low over the city distracted jules and he pointed the camera up seconds before the plane crashed into tower onejules asked the captain to follow him into the towers the first thing he saw was two people on fire something he refused to film he stayed on site for the next several hours filming reactions of the firefighters and others who were therethe brothers naudet took great care in not making the movie too violent grizzly and gory but the language from the firefighters is a little coarse and cbs showed a lot of balls airing it uncensored the brothers naudet mixed footage they filmed with one-on-one interviews so the firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during particular moments of the crisis unlike a feature film of similar title most of the money from dvd sales go to 911-related charities very well made emotional moving and completely devoid of political propaganda is the best documentary of the sort to date<SEP>1

one of boris karloffs real clinkers essentially the dying karloff looking about 120 years older than he wasis a scientist in need of cash to finish his experiments before he dies moving from morocco where his funding is taken over by someone else he goes to the south of france where he works a s physician while trying to scrap enough money to prove his theories desperate for money he makes a deal with the young rich wife of a cotton baron who is dying she will fund him if he helps her poison the husband so she can take his money and carry on with a gigolo who i think is married if you think i got that from watching the movie youre wrong i had to read what other people posted to figure out happened why because this movie had me lost from two minutes ini had no idea what was going on with its numerous characters and multiple converging plot lines little is spelled out and much isnt said until towards the end by which time i really didnt care its a dull mess of interest purely for karloffs performance which is rather odd at times to be honest this is the only time ive ever seen him venture into bela lugosi bizarre territory its not every scene but a few and makes me wonder how much they hung out<SEP>0
it is not every films job to stimulate you superficially i will take an ambitious failure over a mass-market hit any day while this really cant be described as a failure the sum of its parts remains ambiguous that indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watching it again and again this is a challenging provocative movie that does not wrap things up neatly the problem with the movie is in its structure its inpenetrable plot seems to be winding up just as a second ending is tacked on though everything is technically dazzling the movie is exactly too long by that unit the long-delayed climax of leos awakening comes about 20 minutes lategreat cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas the compositing artifice is provocative and engaging; a character is rear-projected but his own hand in the foreground isnt the world depicted is deliberate treacherous and absurd keep your eyes peeled for a memorable technically astonishing assassination that will make your jaw dropthe compositions are stunning whomever chose to release the out of print videotape in the pan & scan format must have never seen it where is the dvdit is unfathomable how anyone could give this much originality a bad review you should see it at least once you get the sense that von trier bit off more than he could chew but this movie ends up being richer for it i suspect he is familiar with hitchcocks foreign correspondent in which devious europeans also manipulate an american dupe and several welles movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does all von trier movies explore the plight of the naif amidst unforgiving societies after zentropa von trier moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary over-rated un-nuanced sap like breaking the waves and dancer in the dark<SEP>1
lol! not a bad way to start it i thought this was original but then i discovered it was a clone of the 1976 remake of king kong i never saw king kong until i was 15 i saw this film when i was 9 the films funky disco music will get stuck in your head! not to mention the films theme song by the yetians this is the worst creature effects ive ever seen at the same time this film remains a holy grail of b-movies memorable quotes: take a tranquilizer and go to bed put the yeti in your tank and you have yeti power i remember seeing this film on movie macrabe hosted by elvira there is one scene where it was like king kong in reverse! in king kong he grabs the girl and climbs up the building but in this film he climbs down the building and grabs the girl who was falling! also around that year was another kong clone mighty peking man 1977 which came from hong kong there is a lot of traveling matte scenes and motorized body parts this film will leave you laughing it is like i said just another king kong clone rated pg for violence language thematic elements and some scary scenes<SEP>0
modern viewers know this little film primarily as the model for the remake the money pit older viewers today watch it with wisps of nostalgia: cary grant myrna loy and melvyn douglas were all superstars in an easier less complicated era or was it time of course has a way of modifying perspectives and with so many films today verily ulcerating with social and political commentary there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older seemingly less provocative films in mr blandings builds his dream house there may therefore be more than what audiences were looking for in 1948 there is political commentary however subtle finding a house in the late 40s was a truly exasperating experience only lightly softened by the coming of levittowns and the like politics in the movie the blandings children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them in school which in real life would get teachers accused of communism in real life too myrna loy was a housing activist a democrat and a feminist melvyn douglas was no less a democratic firebrand: he was married to congresswoman helen gahagan douglas whom young richard nixon accused of being soft on communism and which ruined her jason robards sr has a small role in the film but his political activism was no less noticeable more importantly his son jason robards jr would be for many years a very active liberal democrat almost the odd fellow out was cary grant whose strident conservatism reflected a majority political sentiment in hollywood that was already slipping but this was 1948: communism was a real perceived threat and the blacklist was just around the corner it would be another decade before political activism would reappear in mainstream films and then not so subtly<SEP>1
like most comments i saw this film under the name of the witching which is the reissue title apparently necromancy which is the original is better but i doubt itmost scenes of the witching still include most necromancy scenes and these are still bad in many ways i think the added nudity of the witching at least added some entertainment value! but dont be fooled -theres only 3 scenes with nudity and its of the people standing around variety no diabolique rumpy pumpy involved!this movie is so inherently awful its difficult to know what to criticise first the dialogue is awful and straight out of the troma locker at least troma is tongue in cheek though this is straight-faced boredom personified the acting is variable with pamela franklin flora the possessed kid in the innocents would you believe! the worst with her high-pitched screechy voice welles seems merely waiting for his pay cheque the other female lead has a creepy face so i dont know why pamela thought she could trust her in the film! and the doctor is pretty bad too he also looks worringly like gene wilderit is ineptly filmed with scenes changing for no reason and editing is choppy this is because the witching is a copy and paste job and not a subtle one at that only the lighting is ok the sound is also dreadful and its difficult to hear with the appalling new soundtrack which never shuts up the ghost mother is also equally rubbish but the actress is so hilariously bad at acting that at least it provides some unintentional laughsreally this film the witching at least is only for the unwary it cant have many sane fans as its pretty unwatchable and i actually found it mind-numbingly dull! the best bit was when the credits rolled - enough said so simply better to this poor excuse for a movie like the plague!<SEP>0
diana guzman is an angry young woman surviving an unrelenting series of disappointments and traumas she takes her anger out on the closest targetswhen she sees violence transformed and focused by discipline in a rundown boxing club she knows shes found her home the film progresses from there as diana learns the usual coming-of-age lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing michelle rodriguez is very good in the role particularly when conveying the focused rage of a young woman hemmed in on all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexismthe picture could use some finesse in its direction of all the young actors who pale in comparison to the older more experienced cast there are too many pauses in the script which detracts from the dramatic tension the overall quietness of the film drains it of intensity this is a good picture to see once if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power its limitations prevent it from being placed in the see it again and again category<SEP>0

first of all yes im white so i try to tread lightly in the ever delicate subject of race anyway white people hating black people = bad but black people hating white people = ok because apparently we deserved it!! where do i start i wish i had something good to say about this movie aside unintended comedy scenes: the infamous scene were ice cube and co get in a fight with some really big really strong really really angry and scary looking neo-nazis and win!!! the neo-nazi where twice the size : and the chase! the chase is priceless this is not a movie about race tolerance and understanding it doesnt deliver this is a racist movie that re-affirm all the cliché stereotypes the white wimpy guy who gets manhandled by his black roommate automatically transform in a skinheadcmon simply awful i do regret ever seeing itsave your time and the dreadful experience of a poorly written poorly acted dull and clearly biased picture if you are into the subject go and rent american history x now thats a movie<SEP>0
a film that is so much a 30s warners film in an era when each studio had a particular look and style to their output unlike today where simply getting audiences is the objectcuritz was one of the quintessential warners house directors working with tight economy and great efficiency whilst creating quality working methods that were very much the requirements of a director at warners a studio that was one of the big five majors in this era producing quality films for their large chains of theatreseven though we have a setting of the upper classes on long island there is the generic warners style embedded here with a narrative that could have been torn from the headlines another example is the when the photographers comment on the girls legs early in the film and she comments that theyre not the trophies gives the film a more working mans down to earth feel for these were the audiences that warners were targeting in the great depression ironically columbia and universal were the two minors under these five majors until the 50s when their involvement in television changed their fortunes - they would have made something like this very cheaply and without the polish and great talent curtiz has created from an excellent script a film that moves along at a rapid pace whilst keeping the viewer with great camera angles and swift editingthank heavens there is no soppy love interest sub-plot so the fun can just keep rolling along<SEP>1
though im not the biggest fan of wirework based martial arts films when a film goes straight for fantasy rather than fighting i get a lot more fun out of it and this film is one of the best in terms of fantastical plotting and crazy flying shenanigans ching siu tung has crafted here an enchanting treat with fine performance and much ethereal beauty the great tragic leslie cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a stunning fox spirit and a wacky taoist cheungs performance is filled with naive but dignified charm and wu ma is pleasingly off the wall as the taoist monk who shows off some swordplay and even gets a musical number perhaps best off all is joey wang as the fox spirit truly a delight to behold with every movement and gesture entrancingly seductive the film takes in elements of fantasy horror comedy and romance all stirred together into a constantly entertaining package ching siu tung directing and handling the choreography gives some neat wirework thrills and fills the film with mists shadows and eerily enthralling benighted forest colours giving every forest scene a wonderfully bewitching atmosphere also notable are the elaborate hair stylings and gorgeous flowing garments of the female characters with if im not mistaken joey wang sporting hair done up like fox ears at times a marvellous touch though the film features relatively little action and some perhaps ill advised cheesy pop songs at times this is a beautiful piece of entertainment with swell characters and plotting even the odd neat character arc a near constant supply of visual treats and copious dreamy atmosphere an ethereal treasure highly recommended<SEP>1
i have to totally disagree with the other comment concerning this movie the visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the movie and do not detract from the plot furthermore i loved how this move was unlike crouching tiger because this time the sword action had no strings attached and most of the time you can see the action up closei think western audiences will be very confused with 2 scenes one of which involves a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other concerning the villagers chanting that it is the end of the world the mentioned scenes are derived from certain interpretations of mahayana buddhist text mahayana buddhism can be found in china korea and japan and the other scene deals with a quirk in the japanese calendarpeople back then really thought that the world would come to an end gojoe has the action story and visuals to mesmerize any viewer i strongly believe that with some skillful editing it can be sold in the us my one complaint is in the last fight scene i cant give anything away--sorry<SEP>1
i picked this movie up to replace the dismal choice of daytime television and to go with my thirst for femme fatales well for the previous it is better than daytime televisionthough im not sure how muchit does have its points but after about the first 20-30 minutes the good points pan out and one comes to the conclusion that they are watching a made for tv movie that was put together with not much time to make something that will hold together in short a terrible sci fi channel type movieit has its points such as the future is dirty like blade runner showed of course this is no blade runner the captain looks sort of feels like actor robert forster the kind of person one might want to be aroundbut unfortunately it rather ends up feeling like a bad andromeda rehash where the muscle of the crew consists of poor copies of the smart gunners of aliens the mystic is vampire willow sexually intensified and the new captain might as well be like jan-michael vincent running around on danger island in the banana splits; he only put on the uniform with the epaulets; hes got very little right to it all of them running around with their version of force lances inside a ship that looks very much like the eureka maru as they are fighting a class of people who occupy the universe and are broken up into several different tribes or sects of different evolutionary qualitiesjust like the nietzcheans in andromedait might have a redeeming feature with michael ironside but after a while one gets the feeling that he took the part as a hoot! he probably had fun doing it but it doesnt help the movie muchits okay okay in the way that one might watch the dvd once without turning it off; if they watch it with commercials they will probably change the channel one might watch it once but a few hours later be wondering what it was that made them watch it allfor me that was the femme fatale when she was fighting<SEP>0
usually any film with sylvester stallone is usually going to suck ass rambo: first blood part ii was no exception to this the only movies that sylvester stallone were in that were good were rocky and first blood this film is extreamly unrealistic and boring it has action but not very good action i didnt enjoy watching it and i would never ever watch this again no wonder why it won the razzie award for worst picture i would give this a 310 the only reason why it got the 3 was because it had somewhat good action but not good enough<SEP>0
this is a very entertaining movie a few of the reviews that i have read on this forum have been written by people who apparently think that the film was an effort at serious drama it was not made that wayit is an extremely enjoyable film performed in a tongue in cheek manner all of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us the fight sequences are lively brisk and above all not gratuitous the so-called green death utilized on a couple of occasions is not as i read in one review gruesome a couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between doc and seas near the end of the film hey lighten up again i remind one and all that this is a fun film each phase of this fight was captioned which added to the fun aspect the actors were not trying to emulate bruce lee or jackie chan this is not one of those martial arts films ron ely looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play doc another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the bad guy seas is dealt with i promise you that if you dont try to take this film very seriously and simply watch it for the entertainment value you will spend 100 minutes in a most enjoyable manner<SEP>1
think pierce brosnan and you think suave dapper intelligent james bond in this movie brosnan plays against type - and has lots of fun doing so as does the audience this is a film about a hired assassin who befriends a harried businessman and it works!this is a fun movie with very good scenes a riveting on-the-edge brosnan and a good compliant off-the-edge kinnear have some good lines my only cavil is that hope davis playing the oh-so-tolerant wife can i see your gun doesnt appear more often: she could have been a marvellous foil to these menthis movie is like a matador: it plays with the audience while going for a kill the ending is awesome because a storyline with a positive moral! emerges: this is a frenetic frantic and fun movie which does deserve a wide audience<SEP>1
a new way to enjoy goldsworthys work rivers and tides allows fans to see his work in motion watching goldsworthy build his pieces one develops an appreciation for every stone leaf and thorn that he uses goldsworthy describes how the flow of life the rivers and the tides inspires and affects his work although i was happy the film covered the majority of goldsworthys pieces no snowballs i do feel it was a bit long the film makers did a wonderful job of bringing goldsworthys work to life and created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch<SEP>1
the only thing i remember about this movie are two things: first as a twelve year old even i thought it stunk second it was so bad that when mad magazine did a parody of it they quit after the first page and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page saying that they had completely disavowed itif you want to see great sophomoric comedies of this period try animal house its so stupid and vulgar it lowers itself to high art another good selection would be caddyshack the classic with the late rodney dangerfield and bill murray before he became annoyingly charming with great lines like greens keeper carl spacklers correct me if im wrong sandy but if i kill all the golfers theyll lock me up and throw away the key<SEP>0
this is a kind of movie that will stay with you for a long time soha ali and abhay deol both look very beautiful soha reminds you so much of her mother sharmila tagore abhay is a born actor and will rise a lot in the coming futurethe ending of the movie is very different from most movies in a way you are left unsatisfied but if you really think about it in real terms you realize that the only sensible ending was the ending shown in the movie otherwise it would have been gross injustice to everyone the movie is about a professional witness who comes across a girl waiting to get married in court her boyfriend does not show up and she ends up being helped by the witness slowly slowly over the time he falls in love for her it is not clear if she has similar feelings for him or not watch the movie for complete details the movie really belongs to abhay i look forward to seeing more movies from him soha is pretty but did not speak much in the movie her eyes her innocence did most of the talking<SEP>1
i just didnt get this moviewas it a musical nobut there were choreographed songs and dancing in itwas it a serious dramano the acting was not good enough for thatis whoopi goldberg a quality serious actordefinently noti had difficulty staying awake through this disjointed movie the message on apartheid and the tribute to the students who died during a student uprosing is noted but as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style movie it was worsesee for yourself but in fairness i hated it<SEP>0
granting the budget and time constraints of serial production batman and robin nonetheless earns a place near the bottom of any cliffhanger list utterly lacking the style imagination and atmosphere of its 1943 predecessor batmanthe producer sam katzman was known as king of the quickies and like his director spencer bennett seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than with generating excitement unfortunately this team also produced the two superman serials starring kirk alyn with their tacky flying animation canned music and dull supporting players the opening of each chapter offers a taste of things to come: thoroughly inane titles robin rescues batman batman vs wizard mechanical music droning on and our two heroes stumbling toward the camera looking all around either confused or having trouble seeing through their cheap halloween masks batmans cowl with its devils horns and eagles beak fits so poorly that the stuntman has to adjust it during the fight scenes his utility belt is a crumpled strip of cloth with no compartments from which he still manages to pull a blowtorch and an oxygen tube at critical moments!in any case the lead players are miscast robert lowery displays little charm or individual flair as bruce wayne and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as batman he creates the impression that hed rather be somewhere anywhere else! john duncan as robin has considerable difficulty handling his limited dialogue he is too old for the part with an even older stuntman filling in for him out of costume lowery and duncan are as exciting as tired businessmen ambling out for a drink without one ounce of the chemistry evident between lewis wilson and douglas croft in the 1943 serialalthough serials were not known for character development the earlier batman managed to present a more energetic cast this one offers a group going through the motions not that the filmmakers provide much support not one of the hoodlums stands out and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever the wizard great name! actually they are led by someone sporting a curtain a shawl and a sack over his head with a dubbed voice that desperately tries to sound menacing the prime suspects -- an eccentric professor a radio broadcaster -- are simply annoyingeven the established comic book regulars are superfluous it is hard to discern much romance between vicki vale and bruce wayne despite the perils she faces vicki displays virtually no emotion commissioner gordon is none-too-bright unlike in the previous serial alfred the butler is a mere walk-on whose most important line is mr waynes residence they are props for a drawn-out gimmick-laden incoherent plot further saddled with uninspired repetitive music and amateurish production design the wayne manor exterior resembles a suburban middle-class home in any sitcom the interiors those of a cheap roadside motel the batcave is an office desperately in need of refurbishing the costumes are kept rolled up in a filing cabinet!pity that the filmmakers couldnt invest more effort into creating a thrilling adventure while the availability of the two serials on dvd is a plus for any serious batfan one should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box they capture more of the authentic mood of the comic book than all 15 chapters of batman and robin combinednow for the good news -- this is not the 1997 version!<SEP>0
this move was on tv last night i guess as a time filler because it sucked bad! the movie is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere about half way not bad tits and ass though but the story is too ridiculous for words the wolf if that is what you can call it is hardly shown fully save his teeth when it is fully in view you can clearly see they had some interns working on the cgi because the wolf runs like hes running in a treadmill and the cgi fur looks like its been waxed all shiny :the movie is full of gore and blood and you can easily spot who is going to get killedslashedeaten next even if you like these kind of splatter movies you will be disappointed they didnt do a good job at itdont even get me started on the actors very corny lines and the girls scream at everything about every 5 seconds but then again if someone asked me to do bad acting just to give me a few bucks then hey where do i sign upoverall boring and laughable horror<SEP>0
i watched this movie really late last night and usually if its late then im pretty forgiving of movies although i tried i just could not stand this movie at all it kept getting worse and worse as the movie went on although i know its suppose to be a comedy but i didnt find it very funny it was also an especially unrealistic and jaded portrayal of rural life in case this is what any of you think country life is like its definitely not i do have to agree that some of the guy cast members were cute but the french guy was really fake i do have to agree that it tried to have a good lesson in the story but overall my recommendation is that no one over 8 watch it its just too annoying<SEP>0
one of the worst films i have ever seen how to define worst i would prefer having both eye balls yanked out and then be forced to tap dance on them than ever view this pitiful dreck again somehow one-hit wonder zwick manages a film that simultaneously offends elvis fans mary kay saleswomen las vegas gays fbi agents and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a shoddy sloppy farce so forced it deserves to be forsaken ed how elvis presley enterprises could allow the rights of actual elvis songs to be used in a film with a central premise that seems to be the only good elvis presley imitator is a dead one is beyond me the worst part of this mess - and that takes some work - is the mangled script: in 1958 elvis words and songs that he would speakperform in the 1970s are quoted! worst special effect that oscar would go to the moron who decided that elvis grave potentially the most photographedrecognizable grave in the world resembles a pyramid with a gold record glued atop and is situated in the middle of a park somewhere potentially this films biggest audience would be elvis fans however the rampant stupidity nixon gave elvis a dea badge not fbi credentialsand i could go on and on actually undercuts that conventional wisdom ugh i used the word wisdom to describe this stupid movie this is truly a horrible horrible film<SEP>0
i saw this movie in 1969 when it was first released at the cameo theater on south beach now the famous crowbar night-club it was the last year of the wild 60s and this movie really hit home its got everything; the generation gap the sexual revolution the quest for success and the conflict between following ones family traditions to those of seeking ones own way through lifeit was a fast paced highly enjoyable movie vegas was at its hippiest peak sin city in all its glory beautiful women famous cameos laughs conflict romance and even a happy ending a very enjoyable time over all the poster from this film rests on my bedroom wall i look at it and i go back in time; a time of my youth and my times with my dad a great time in my life<SEP>1
okay i must say that before the revealing of the monster saying that he really didnt fit into that category just some weird thing that had an annoying screech! and personally i think a granny could have ran away from that thing but anyway i actually was getting into this film although having the main character a drunk and a heroine addict didnt come as an appeal but such scenes as when she runs away from the train and you can see the figure at the door was kind of creepy also where the guard had just been killed and the monster put his hand on the screenbut then disaster stuck form the moment the monster was revealed it just became your average horror with limited thrills or scares slowly i became more bored and wanted to shut the thing off i like most people have said was rooting for the homeless people to make it specially the guy he gave me a few cheap laughs here and there i think this film could have really been something special instead it became what every other horror nowadays are! just boring and well not worth the moneyif you are looking for a cheap scare here and there or a mindless gore fest which is limited hardly any in fact by all means give it a go but for all you serious horror watchers look somewhere else much better films out there<SEP>0
a give this movie a 1010 because it deserves a 1010 two of the best actors of their time-walter matthau & george burns collaborate with neil simon and all of the other actors that are in this film + director herbert ross and all of that makes this stage adaption come true the sunshine boys is one of the best films of the 70s i love the type of humor in this film it just makes me laugh so hardi got this movie on vhs 3 days ago yes vhs because it was cheaper-only $3 i watched it as soon as i got home but i had to watch it again because i kept missing a few parts the first time the second time i watched it it felt a lot better and i laughed a lot harder im definitely going to re-get this on dvd because i have to see the special featuresits very funny how that happens two people work together as entertainersactorsperformers they get along well on stage but really argue off stage they cant survive another minute with each other then some 15 years later you want to reunite them for a tv special you can find that in this film matthau & burns were terrific in this film its a damn shame they died george burns deserved that oscar he gave a strong comic performance he was also 78 when this movie was filmed so far hes the oldest actor to receive an academy award at an old age jessica tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress richard benjamin was also fantastic in this he won a golden globe for best supporting actor he deserved that golden globe although many people might disagree with what i am about to say everybody in this film gave a strong performance this comedy is an instant classic i highly recommend it one more thing: whoever hates this film is a putz<SEP>1
i confess to have quite an uneasy feeling about ghosts movies and while i sometimes enjoy the genre when it comes to horror but when it comes to comedies they really need to be crazy to be funny over her dead body seems to take afterlife a little bit too seriously and fails in my opinion from almost any aspect i can think about the story is completely unbelievable of course and did not succeed to convince me either in the comic or in the sentimental register the choice of the principal actresses was awful while paul rudd is at least handsome and looks like a nice guy the taste in ladies of his character seems to need serious improvement as eva longoria seems too aged sorry for him and lake bell seems too unattractive sorry again a romantic story without good enough reason for romance is due to failure from start jason biggs and lindsey sloane were actually better but they had only supporting roles the rest is uninteresting and uninspired with flat cinematography and cheap gags borrowed from unsuccessful tv comedies nothing really worth watching nothing to remember<SEP>0
this was the worst acted movie ive ever seen in my life no really im not kidding all the based on a true storyhistorical references aside theres no excuse for such bad acting its a shame because as others have posted the sets & costumes were greatthe sound track was typical asian-style music although i couldnt figure out where the modern love song came in when fernando was lying in his bed thinking of maria i dont know who wrote & sang that beautiful song but it was as if suddenly norah jones was transported to the 1500sthe hershey syrup blood in phycho was more realistic than the ketchup spurted during the kwik-n-ez battle scenesbut the acting oh so painfully sad lines delivered like a bad junior high play if gary stretch had donned a potato costume for the county 4h fair he may have been more believable towards the end he sounded more like a little italy street thug at times i half expected him to yell out adrian! or even you wanna piece of me!favourite line: when the queen says to her lover after barfing on the floor im going to have a baby he responds a child i expected her to retort no jackass a chair leg! duh<SEP>0
an interesting animation about the fate of a giant tiger a sloth and a mammoth who saved a baby who was close to be killed by a group of tigers during the ice age the morale of the film shows that good behavior with the others may bring benefits at the end one of the tigers in the group got an order to finally capture the baby who was hardly saved by his mother when the tigers attacked her community the baby was then rescued by the sloth and the mammoth but the tiger joined them with the objective of finally taken away the baby they went through very troublesome paths with plenty of danger and at once the tiger was to fall down and saved by the mammoth at the end the group of tigers tried to capture the baby but the mammoth helped incredibly by his tiger colleague was able to overcome this attack and to give the baby back to his father and the community to which he belongs<SEP>1
joan crawford had just begun her working girl makes good phase with the dynamic paid 1930 she had never attempted a role like that before and critics were impressed so while other actresses were wondering why their careers were foundering because they were clinging to characters that had been the in thing a few years before but were now becoming passe joan was listening to the public and securing her longevity as an actress the depression was here and jazz age babies who survived on an endless round of parties were frowned upon of course if you became rich through immoral means but suffered for it - that was alrightthis film starts out with a spectacular house boat party bonnie jordan joan crawford is the most popular girl there - especially when she suggests that everyone go swimming in their underwear!!! however when bonnies father has a heart attack because of loses on the stock market both bonnie and her brother rodney william bakewell realise who their real friends are after bob townsend lester vail - a poor mans johnny mack brown offers to do the right thing and marry her - they had just spent a night together when bonnie declared with abandon that she wants love on approval - she starts to show some character by deciding to get a jobshe finds a job at a newspaper and quickly impresses by her will to do well her working buddy is bert scranton cliff edwards and together they are given an assignment to write about the inside activities of the mob rodney also surprises her with the news that he also has a job she is thrilled for him but soon realises it is bootlegging and he is mixed up with cold blooded killer jake luva clark gable rodney witnesses a mass shooting and goes to pieces spilling the beans to the first person he sees drinking at the bar - which happens to be bert he is then forced to kill bert and after- wards he goes into hiding the paper pulls out all stops in an effort to find berts killer and sends bonnie undercover as a dancer in one of jakes clubs joan does a very lively dance to accordian joe - much to sylvies disgust the film ends with a gun battle and as rodney lies dying bonnie tearfully phones in her storythis is a super film with crawford and gable giving it their all natalie moorehead who as sylvie shared a famous cigarette scene with gable early in the film was a stylish other woman who had her vogue in the early thirties william bakewell had a huge career he had started as a teenager in a douglas fairbanks film in the mid 20s a lot of his roles though were weak spineless characters in this film he played the weak brother and was completely over-shadowed by joan crawford and the dynamic newcomer clark gable - maybe that was why he never became a starhighly recommended<SEP>1

bertrand blier is indeed lenfant terrible of french cinema and in the seventies he always could shock the public filmed with his fave duo depardieu and dewaere and the usual dose of sex miou-miou plays her typical role at least the one from the seventies as little could we know that a decade later she would be the best french actress ever in first les valseuses is also one of the first roadmovies as the viewer is just taken to some journeys of two little criminals those who only are satisfied with family life or simply know nothing more the movie would be quite a shocker but this movie is more than just that it just let you think of all the usual things in life working for the car being bounded at work etc its a sort of critic towards the hypocrite society were living in great job and it just makes you wish two things : dewaere died just too young as he was a topactor and of course depardieu hed better should have stuck with french movies as he proves here that no one can beat him timeless classic and 20 years later it will still shock some<SEP>1
so finally i know it exists along with the other uk contributors on here i saw this on what must have been its only uk screening in the 70s i remembered the title but got nowhere when i mentioned it to people it scarred me thats 2 rs but when you go to bed with doom whizzing about your brain and listening all around for impending terror then isnt that what a truly classic horror movie is all about i can barely remember the intricacies of the movie but what i do recollect is my shivering flesh and heightened senses can anyone confirm my suspicions that this is black and white again if anyone has any info on how to obtain a copy of this please get in touch<SEP>1
this is one of the best animated family films of all time moreover virtually all of the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind of hiyao miyazaki and his studio ghibli specifically other great films include my neighbor totoro and kikkis delivery service spirited away is quite good but a bit too creepy for typical family fare - better for teenagers and adult the one thing that sets laputa: castle in the sky apart from other films by miyazaki is that it is far more of a tension-filled adventure ridewhy is this film so good because its a complete package: the animation is very well done and the story is truly engaging and compellingmost japanese anime is imaginative but decidedly dark or cynical or violent; and the animation itself is often jerky stylized and juvenile none of these problems plague castle in the sky it has imagination to burn and the characters are well drawn if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people none of those trench-coat wearing posers there is plenty of adventure but not blood and gore the animation is smooth detailed and cinematic ally composed - not a lot of flat shots the backgrounds are wonderfulthe voice acting in the dubbed english version is first rate particularly the two leads pazo james van der beek and sheeta anna paquin the sound engineering is great too use your studio sound if youve got itone aspect that i particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left unexplained laputa was once inhabited and is now abandoned why we never know we know as much as we need to know and then we just have to accept the rest which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized indeed it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most of the minor characters who are for the most part one-dimensional stock characters eg gruff general silly sidekick kooky old miner etc highly recommended for people aged 6 to 60!<SEP>1
ok hollywood is not liberalobviously im lieing because it is im a conservative but the politics i will leave out of my opinion of the movie this movie was anti bush anti middle east anti big oil propaganda but that is not why it was badfist off i will give credit where credit is due i saw this film opening night because i happen to like these kinds of films and am a political science major in collage the cinematography was excellent and the acting was as far as i could tell very goodthe plot was impossible for me to decode however i have been tested and have an iq of 138 but no matter how hard i tried there was no way i could piece together the story line of the movie and what characters where doing whatthe story and scene sequence was totally incoherent and poorly organizedunless this is one of those movies that is meant to be watch many times to get the full depth pf the story which it very well may be i have no idea exactly what was going onwhich makes sense because if you want to make a political argument and not receive any criticism then make your argument impossible to critique! if you cant dazzle them with brilliance then baffle them with bull s<SEP>0
by 1976 the western was an exhausted genre and the makers of this film clearly knew it still instead of shelving the project and saving us from having to watch it they went ahead and made it anyway apparently in need of an interesting thread to get the audiences to come and see the film they decided to make it as blatantly violent and unpleasant as possible hell it worked for the wild bunch so why shouldnt it work here of course the wild bunch had the benefit of a superb script but the script of the last hard men is plain old-fashioned rubbish its hard to figure out what attracted charlton heston and james coburn to their respective roles heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a violent outlaw coburn the hunt becomes even more personal when hestons daughter barbara hershey is kidnapped by the convicts and subjected to sexual degradation this is a bloodthirsty film indeed in which every time someone dies it is displayed in over-the-top detail its tremendously disappointing really because the star pairing sounds like a mouth-watering prospect theres no sense of pace or urgency in the film either it takes an eternity to get going but when the action finally does come it is marred by the emphasis on nastiness all in all this might be the very worst film that heston ever made im sure its one of the productions he is loathe to include on his illustrious cv<SEP>0
first and foremost speaking as no fan of the genre the bourne ultimatum is a breathtaking virtuoso superb action moviesecondly it is a silly malarky of cartoonish super-hero stuffthirdly the film carries a complex important point about crime-fighters turning into criminals themselves no reference is made to abu ghraib or the executive branchs outrageous domestic assaults on constitutional rights none is necessaryso the latest in the bourne series in the hands of paul greengrass of the 2004 bourne supremacy and last years united 93 is a significant achievement perhaps held back but not actually diminished by the unavoidable excesses of the genrebreathtaking above is meant both as a complimentary adjective and a description of the physical sensation: for more than an hour from the first frame the viewer seemingly holds his breath pushed back against the chair by the force of relentless globe-trotting utterly suspenseful action there is no letup no variation in the rhythm and pull of the film and yet it never becomes monotonous and tiresome the way some kindred music videos do after just a couple of minutesoliver woods in-your-face cinematography is making the best of tony gilroys screenplay from robert ludlums 1990 novel which doesnt stack up well against the bourne identity written a decade earliermatt damon is once again the inevitable irreplaceable bourne the deadliest of fantasy cia agents this time taking on the entire agency in search of his identity his past and the mysterious agency program that has turned him into a killing machine nothing like his quietly heroic edward r murrow the always-marvelous david strathairn is the nasty top agency official pitched against bourne in trying to hide some illegal take-no-prisoners policies and brutal proceduresjoan allen plays what appears to be the good cop against strathairns bad one and there is julia stiles as the agent once again coming to bournes aid; a combination of greengrass direction and stiles acting results in a surprising impact by a mostly silent character her lack of communication and blank expression more intriguing than miles of dialogueso good is the bourne ultimatum that it gets away with the old one-man-against-the-world bit this time stretched to ridiculous excesses as bourne defies constraints of geography time gravity and physics in general can you fly backwards with a car from the top of a building why not - it looks great all this real-world magic - leaping from country to country in seconds to arrive at some unknown location exactly as when and how needed - outdoes special-effect and superhero cartoon improbabilities and yet only a clueless pedant would allow facts interfere with the entertainment-based ecstasy of the bourne fantasy<SEP>1
one of the cornerstones of low-budget cinema is taking a well-known classic storyline and making a complete bastardization out of it phantom of the mall is no exception to this rule the screenwriter takes the enduring phantom of the opera storyline and moves it into a late 80s shopping mall however the phantoms goal now is simply to get revenge upon those responsible for disfiguring his face and murdering his family the special effects do provide a good chuckle especially when body parts begin appearing in dishes from the yogurt stand pauly shore has a small role which does not allow him to be as fully obnoxious as one would expect mostly due to the fact that his fifteen minutes of mtv fame had not yet arrived if youre looking for a few good laughs at the expense of the actors and special effects crew check this flick out otherwise keep on looking for something else<SEP>0
all the kids aged from 14-16 want to see this movie although you are only allowed at 18 they have heard it is a very scary movie and they feel so cool when they watched it i feel very sad kids cant see what a good movie is and what a bad movie is this was one of the worst movies i saw in months every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie and the end its an open ending why because it is impossible to come up with a decent en for such a stupid story this movie is just made to make you scared and if you are a bit smart and know some about music you exactly know when youll be scared when the movie was finished and i turned to my friend and told a bit to loud him that this was a total waste of money some stupid kid looked strange at me these day i could make an oscar with a home-video of my goldfish if only i use the right marketing<SEP>0
being a transplanted new yorker i might be more critical than most in watching city hall but i have to say that before even getting to the story itself i was captivated by the location shooting and the political atmosphere of new york city that director harold becker createdfor example theres a reference to woerners restaurant in brooklyn where political boss frank anselmo likes to eat there is or was a woerners restaurant on remsen street in downtown brooklyn when i lived in new york back in 1996 it was in fact particularly favored by political people in the borough though they did have a couple of other hangoutsno surprise because the script was co-authored by nicholas pileggi who still writes both political and organized crime stories he knows the atmosphere quite well and he sure knows how those two worlds cross as they do in this filma detective played by nestor serrano goes for an unofficial meeting with a relative of mob boss anthony franciosa and things erupt and three people wind up dead including an innocent 6 year old boy whose father was walking him to school the story mushrooms and at the end its reached inside city hall itselfal pacino plays mayor john pappas and john cusack is his deputy mayor a transplanted louisianan a state which has a tradition of genteel corruption itself hes the outsider here and in trying to do damage control cusack finds more than he bargained fordanny aiello plays brooklyn political boss frank anselmo and for those of you not from new york his character is based on the late borough president of queens donald manes who was also brought down by scandal hes very much the kind of brooklyn politician i knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them do aiello in city hall was the farewell performance on film for anthony franciosa one of the most underrated and under-appreciated talents ever on the screen no one watches anyone else whenever hes onal pacinos best moment is when at the funeral of the young child killed he takes over the proceedings and turns it into a political triumph for himself his is a complex part hes a decent enough man but one caught up in the corruption it takes to rise in a place like new york for those who want to know about political life in the big apple city hall is highly recommended<SEP>1
may the saints preserve us because this movie is not going to helpsomeone with access needs to e-mail mel gibson and tell him we need a faithful production of beowulf something that actually has something in common with the epic poem that is the foundation for all modern western literaturethe recent since 2000 versions of beowulf make we wonder two things first why is there so much interest in the story second why are all these filmmakers squandering mountains of cash on this crapthe only reason this got a two is that the version with lambert in it beowulf 2000 was worse and needed the 1what is even worse some people will watch this and get the wrong idea about the poem how can an industry where peter jackson gets a literary conversion to film so right can get it so wrong i mean really the roman forum as a model for heorot is too muchand please horns on helmets spare me this is insultinghjm<SEP>0
there is something in most of us especially guys that admires some really working class small town real men populist fare and sean penn serves it up for us with a cherry on top hey a lot of people use penn as a political whipping boy but i dont rate movies or actordirectors based on politics or personality that is what right wing commentators like excretable faux movie reviewer debbie schlussel does while acknowledging he is one of our best actors and a good director i think this picture was a simplistic piece of aimless dreck that he has atoned for since okay you have the gist of this there is this good cop a small town trooper joe played against type by david morse who in the opening scene chases some guy on a country farm road in big sixties cars the bad guy stops gets out shoots at him so joe has to blast him dead there was no explanation what drove this man to do such a desperate violent thing and the dead mans parents do some redneck freak out at the police station while joe feels real sad and guilty that he had to kill someone so we know that joe the farmer forced off his land into a cop job is a good basic sort of guy then his brother frank shows up he is a sadistic amoral bully fresh out of the army and nam where the war got his blood lust up some people here and in other reviews called him just an irresponsible hell raising younger brother and sean was trying to make some point about what our john wayne tough guy culture and war does to otherwise good people but what i saw was an amoral sadistic bully who enjoys hurting and ripping people off then there is mom and dad marsha mason and charles bronson who do the requisite turn as old fashioned country couple then die off; she by illness and he by shotgun suicide to advance the story for us both times frank the bad guy is away being a miserable sob but good joe brings him back to podunksville from jail so frank can straighten his life out by welding bridges and living with his utterly stupid screaming trashy pregnant wife but joe has a nice wife played by italian actress valeria golina who is mexican and sean uses this as an exercise in some affirmative action embellishment of goody joe and his real soulfulness underneath his uniform and crew cut for me that was an utterly pointless affirmative action subplot that sean uses to burnish his tough guy creds by sucking up to mexicans because mexicans are so tough and coolbut frank is bad and we get the requisite events like stealing friends car robbing gas station by beating the clerk over the head then torching the car and all those cool things that hell raisers do then there are the mandatory 8mm film childhood flashbacks of young joey dutifully moving the lawn and cowboy dressed franky jumping on his back and wrestling him and yadda yadda so we all know what deep bond there is between the two of themso the film meanders around with a lot of small town schlock to warm the heart of any red stater accompanying the film was a great soundtrack of good sixties songs like jefferson airplane and janis joplin which were totally inappropriate except for the 60s era effect to win the hearts of old hippies the worst offense is that since the movie was inspired by a springsteen song the highway patrolman that song was not included so joes brain dead wife goes into labor and joe runs off to the bar to get loaded and spout some populists drunken victims spiel about how tough things are while good joey comes to drag him back to his wife the bartender is good ole ceasar played by dennis hopper so viggo - frank whigs out for no particular reason and beats his pal ceasar to death after good joe the cop leavesso joe has chase his bad brother down and i was so hoping that he would do the right thing and blow that menace to society away instead we get a scene where his brother stops ahead of him in some old 50s junker on some lonely road at night and little franky in his cowboy suit and cap guns gets out of the car to face good joe the kid from the 8mm flashback home movie sequence oy such dreck! then to top off this drecky sap fest there is some zen crap about the indian runner who is a messenger becomes the message ala marshall macluhen see what i mean sean has done much better than this so dont be afraid to miss this one<SEP>0
the only thing remarkable about this movie is that all the actors could bomb at the same time idiocy i want my money backand i got it free from the library sheesh i would rather chew on tin fool and shave my head with a cheese grater then watch this again<SEP>0
lizzie bordens love crimes is an important film dealing with the dark side of female sexuality and including full frontal female nudity which sure beats the male kind it flirts with sadomasochism and the captive falling in love with captor theorythis treatment of feminine libido is sometimes shallow and jerky but borden has travelled well beyond feminist dogma of females gaining power through their insatiable lustone striking scene exposes the female fetish for horses when the antagonist a counterfeit fashion photographer is seducing an older woman wearing breeches by asking her to show how she rides a horse he shoves a riding crop between her legs pressing it against her crotch and this greatly increases her excitementthen suddenly he leaves her home and she swears abjectly at the closed doorpatrick bergin plays the con artist and though he falls a long distance from handsome he picks on plain janes and has enough screen presence to make one believe the women could swallow his line by all reports sean young proves a weird person and she is scarcely beautiful yet in this film as the district attorney her intense face and long-limbed slender body and accentuated hips and periodically disjointed movement alchemize into erotic fascination her performance is forceful and complexborden possesses an intriguing worldview and the fact that it stands so at odds with the modern feckless zeitgeist i truly appreciate<SEP>1
just like last years event wwe new years revolution 2006 was headlined by an elimination chamber match the difference between last years and this years match however was the entertainment value in reality only three people stood a chance of walking out of the pepsi arena in albany new york with the wwe championship those men were current champion john cena kurt angle and shawn michaels there was no way vinnie mac would put the belt on any of the rookies; carlito or chris masters and kane kane last held the wwe championship in june 1998 and that was only for one night it was obvious he wasnt going to be the one either last years match was a thrilling affair with six of the best wwe had to offer 2006 was a predictable and disappointing affair but still the match of the night by farthe only surprise of the evening came after the bell had run on the main event out strolled vince mcmahon himself and demanded they lift the chamber it was then announced that edge was cashing in his money in the bank championship match right then and there with no time to prepare and just off the back of winning the elimination chamber match john cena did not stand a chance and dropped the title after a spear to one of the most entertaining heels in wwe this was the only entertaining piece of action that happened all nightthe undercard like last year was truly atrocious triple h and the big show put on a snore fest that had me struggling to stay away hhh picked up the win but that was never in any real doubt was it any pay-per-view that has both jerry lawler and viscera wrestling on the same card will never have any chance of becoming a success really does it the king pinned helms who books this stuff and big vis tasted defeat against the wasted shelton benjamin with a little help from his mamathe women of the wwe also had a busy night there was the usual diva nonsense with a bra and panties gauntlet match which was won by ashley and the womans championship was also on the line in a match i thought would have been left to brew till wrestlemania 22 mickie james challenged trish stratus in a good match trish won the contest but it was evident that this is going to continue for the foreseeable futurethe opening contest of the night pitted soon to be wwe champion edge against intercontinental champion ric flair this could have been better but it was a battered and bloody flair that retained after a disqualification finish edge obviously had bigger fish to fryso new years revolution kicked off the 2006 pay-per-view calendar in disastrous fashion the only good thing from that is knowing that for the wwe the only way is up they dont get much worse than this<SEP>0
pointless short about a bunch of half naked men slapping and punching each other thats it for about 5 minutes we see this its shot in black and white with tons of half-naked men running around slapping each other to the tune of dreadful music it looks interesting but theres no plot and really--the violence inherent in this got disturbing also the homo eroticism in this is played up but mixing it with violence was not a good idea some people who like avant garde material might like this but i found it incomprehensible boring stupid and ocassionally disturbing really--what is the point in all this i saw it as part of a festival of gay shorts and the audience sat there in stunned silence i really wish i could go lower than 1<SEP>0
the views of earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by nasa have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of apollo 11 and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the daythis would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the whole earth picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft windowi am waiting for bart sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by nasa though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map and the ones in private hands would still be a problemah a response: trying to discredit this movie by referring to nasa weather data id say is a charming but weak and gullible argument what about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie a certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here :- this movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by us government that the moon-missions were a success and that man now are true masters of the universe things are nearly never quite what they seem just watch the movie and i dear say youll see things a bit different than beforefirst off weather data doesnt come from nasa it comes for met agencies around the world second the weather data undermines a major claim in the film third far from being packed with irrefutable evidence the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film so he edited it and added his own interpretation unfortunately for him his source film is public domain and the bits sibrel edited out contradict his claims<SEP>0
this movie is an amusing and utterly sarcastic view of pop culture and the producers thereof i was impressed with the photography that consisted of vivid colors and spin doctored settings especially when you think that this is zukovics first large scale attemptone warning do not take the movies message that seriously it is not for mass consumption and that is not a compliment the message is a somewhat stylized post-college neophyte view of societyi did enjoy the basic plot line of a fictitious zine editor verbally whipping the mobocracy of the 90s<SEP>1

the big bad swim has a low budget indie feel about it so many times i start to watch independent films that have had really good reviews only to find out they are pretentious crud voted for by people who are so blinded by the idea of the film and its potential to be provocative that they forget that film is a form of entertainment first and foremosti do not know if the big bad swim has any message or higher meaning or metaphor if it does then i missed itfrom the get go bbs felt right it was easy and warm and human there were no major dramas or meaningful insights i just connected with the characters straight off and when as with all good films the end came around i felt sadness at the loss of that connectionif you are looking for something big or fast or insightful look elsewhere look for a film trying to deliver more than it can bbs delivers a solid enjoyable real experience and i felt rewarded and satiated having watched it<SEP>1
im giving this movie a 1 because there are no negative numbers in imdb rating system this movie was horrible it was very badly acted the story was poorly written the action was unbelievable i doubt even the salvation army could battle as poorly as the troops did in this film i wont even write any plot spoilers because the movie just isnt good enough for plot spoilers to write comments on the plot would be pointless if i were to compare this movie id have to compare it to reign of fire however although i didnt like reign of fire either that movie at least was better than this one some of the people in the theater left before the movie was even halfway done the only reason i didnt was because i simply didnt think to do it i was hoping for a feast of cgi and fighting masterfully done but that isnt what happened the martial arts lasted all of 30 seconds and that was from an exercise routine done during the flash-back scene very disappointing the cgi was not done well either one scene comes to mind during one of the earlier tank battles the troops are firing away atnothing someone forgot to cue the animation guys on that bit of film so the street was totally devoid of bad guys im also thinking the bad guys voice was dubbed by the voice-over of imotep from the mummy movies had that same scraggly echoing thing going on someone owed some royalties here since i mentioned the fight scene ill say yeah that might be considered a spoiler but only to the purists i supposedont go see it dont buy the dvd when it comes out either you have been warned<SEP>0
elizabeth rohm was the weakest actress of all the law and order adas and her acting is even worse here her attempts at a texas accent are amateurish and unrealistic nor can she adequately summon the intense emotions needed to play the mother of a kidnapped child; at times while her daughter is missing she manages to sound only vaguely annoyed as if she cant remember where she left her keysthis is an important true story so its too bad that the awful acting of the lead actress distracts so much from the message the rest of the cast is talented enough but they just cant overcome rohms tendency to simply lay on a particularly thick imitation of a southern drawl whenever actual acting is required<SEP>0

maybe this isnt fair because i only made it about halfway through the movie one of the few movies i have actually not been able to watch due to lamenessthe acting is terrible the camera work is terrible the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is just unrealistic and cheesy for example - during a coke deal the coke is just kept loose in a briefcase - im no expert but i think people generally put it in a bagthey use the same stupid sound effect whenever a punch is thrown its that over the top crunching sound and they use toy guns with dubbed in sound effectsworst movie ever<SEP>0
this film is something like a sequel of white zombie since it is made by the same man halperin and features zombies halperin the george a romero of his day fails to deliver with this one thoughwe have a man who can control the minds of people in cambodia and a search to destroy the source of his power so the zombies can be sent free also a love interest for the evil manwhere this film really excels is in the imagery the cambodian temples and dancers are very nice and the zombie look very powerful in their large numbers unfortunately we dont really get to see much of the zombies in action and the love story seems to play a much too large role for a horror film though this has a valid plot reason later oni would have loved to see some 1930s zombies attack helpless city folk but this film just did not deliver and no strong villain like bela lugosi was waiting to do battle against our heroes and the use of lugosis eyes a nice effect but misleading as he is never in the film why not recreate this with the new actors eyes overall a film that could be a great one with a little script re-working and could someday be a powerful remake especially if they keep it in the same post-war time frame heck if they can fix up the hills have eyes then this film has hope<SEP>0
some of the worst least natural acting performances ive ever seen which is perhaps not surprising given the clunky lame dialog given to the one note characters add to that the cheap production values and youve got a movie that doesnt look like it even belongs on television one doesnt expect much from a lifetime movie especially one this old but this is nearly unwatchably badplot-wise its a dreadful clichéd romance of a type even harlequin would consider beneath them its possible to guess how the remainder of the movie will go by simply watching the opening couple of scenes surprise the only female character who gets any focus and the mysterious stranger end up falling in love<SEP>0
verry classic plot but a verry fun horror movie for home movie party really gore in the second part this movie proves that you can make something fun with a small budget i hope that the director will make another one<SEP>1
even in the 21st century child-bearing is dangerous: women have miscarriages and give birth prematurely seventy-five years ago it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth that is the theme of life begins: a look at the difficult cases ward of a maternity hospital loretta young plays the lead a woman brought here from prison what crime she committed is not germane to the plot to give birth; shes conflicted about the fact shes going to have to give her baby up after birth shes in a ward with several other women who share their joys and pain with each otheralthough loretta young is the lead the outstanding performance as usual is put in by glenda farrell farrell was one of warners b women in the 1930s showing up quite a bit in supporting roles and sometimes getting the lead in b movies farrell played torchy blane in several installments of the torchy b-movie series here farrell plays an expectant mother who doesnt want her children since theyll only get in the way she does everything she can to get in the way of the nurses including smuggling liquor into the ward this of course during the prohibition days and drinking like a fish -- apparently theyd never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome back in the 30sinterestingly unlike most movie of the early 1930s its not the women being bumbling idiots getting in the way of the heroic men -- that situation is reversed with the expectant fathers being quivering mounds of jelly watch for veteran character actor frank mchugh as one of the expectant fathers life begins being an early talkie treats the subject with a fair dollop of melodrama to be sure but its quite a charming little movie turner classic show it albeit infrequently; ive only seen it show up on a few days honoring loretta young but its highly recommended viewing when it does show up<SEP>1
nothings more enjoyable for me than a who-dun-it or suspense tale that keeps you guessing throughout as to how the whole thing will end and thats precisely what happens in deathtrap based on a chilling play by ira levin rosemarys babyand in it michael caine and christopher reeve get to do the kind of stunt that caine and laurence olivier pulled off in sleuth--with just about as much skill and as many puzzles as ever existed in that extraordinarily clever playbut because its meant to scare you surprise you and keep you guessing as to the outcome its difficult to write a review about the plot lets just say that what we know in the beginning is all you have to know about the film for the present michael caine is an insanely jealous playwright whose latest play has failed miserably when a young aspiring writer christopher reeve sends him the manuscript of his play caine realizes that passing it off as his own would solve all his problems and get his reputation backfrom that point on its a matter of fun and games for the audience as ira levins story unwinds managing to trump agatha christie for the number of twistscaine and reeve play off each other brilliantly each bringing a certain dynamic tension to the tale as well as some humorous touches that come from a script that laces drama with humorsumming up: well worth seeing--but not everyone is pleased with the ending<SEP>1
houseboat horror is a great title for this film its absolutely spot-on and therefore the only aspect of the film for which i can give 10 out of 10 there are houseboats there is horror theres even horror that takes place on houseboats but if there were ever a tagline for the film poster it would surely be something shonky this way comes for houseboat horror is easily the worst australian horror film ive ever seen not to mention one of the worst horror films ive ever seen and a fairly atrocious attempt at film-making in general the good news is its so bloody awful it sails straight through the zone of viewer contempt into the wonderful world of unintentional hilarity its worth watching *because* its bloody awfulthe category of worst comes not from the storyline for the simple reason that there actually is one: a record producer a film crew and a rock band drive up to the mystifyingly-named lake infinity a picturesque rural retreat somewhere in victoria in reality lake eildon to shoot a music video someone isnt especially happy to see them there and possibly in an attempt to do the audience a favour starts picking them off one by one with a very sharp knife even more mystifying is how long it takes the survivors to actually notice this on the surface it looks like a very bog-standard b-movie slasher youve got highly-annoying youths intolerant elders creepy locals one of whom a petrol station attendant would easily win a gurning competition and lets face it my description of the murderer could easily be jason voorhees ah but if only the acting and production values were anywhere near as good as the comparative masterpiece that was friday the 13th part vii unfortunately houseboat horror is completely devoid of both these thingsbut in the end this only makes what you do get so ridiculous and amusing fans of one-time late show and get this member tony martin will already be aware of some of the real dialogue gems check out the viewyoull bar up! while the actual song to accompany the music video is so bad it has to be heard to be believed - i cant help wondering if writerdirector ollie wood hoped it would actually become a hit the horror element is comparable i think to b-slashers of the genre and particularly of the period but there were times when i couldnt help imagining someone biting into a hamburger off-screen and seeing a volley of tomato sauce sprayed at the wall on-screenindeed if youve been listening to tony martin recommending this film as hilarious rubbish like myself i dont think youll be disappointed any fans of so-bad-its-good horror should not pass up the opportunity whether youll bar up or not though is another matter if on the other hand you are in search of genuine excellence in the australian horror genre get yourself a copy of the incomparable long weekend and dont look back<SEP>0
i grew up in houston and was nine when this movie came out as a result i dont remember anything about the movie but i do remember the sensation it caused from gilleys and the mechanical bull to johnny lees hit song lookin for love which still brings back memories of childhood whenever i hear ithowever a few years ago i saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all i can say is i was blown away few movies have hit me harder this movie is as raw and real as you can get from uncle bobs ranch house the chemical plant in texas city gilleys dance hall and bud and sissy and maybe for that reason it doesnt have a wider appeal but no matter how you feel about country music i for one cant stand it despite my houston roots urban cowboy is a unique slice of american pie for that reason i love it!<SEP>1

a must see for anyone who loves photography stunning and breathtakingleaves you in ore seen it twice once in a cinema and now on dvd it holds up well on dvd but on the big screen this was something elsetook my two daughters to see this and they loved it my oldest cried at the endbut she was the one who wanted to see it again tonight when she saw it at the video shop its simple telling of a childs love for nature and in particular a fox is told well in some ways it reminded me of the bear in its telling a story not documentary formate which works for children very well not being preached to is very important you make your own mind upbut the star of this film is the cinematographers how did they do what they did amazing just amazing<SEP>1
why cant more directors these days create horror movies like the shining theres an easy answer to that: modern day directors are not stanley kubrick kubrick proved once-and-for-all with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and auteurs of all timeso the plot is fairly simple a man named jack torrance played brilliantly by jack nicholsonand his family move into a large secluded hotel to watch over it for the off-season the kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered his wife and two girls what follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie but you have to watch it to see what i meanthis is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as scary its some seriously messed up stuff but in a good way one of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music music has been a major part of kubricks movies 2001: a space oddysey and a clockwork orange just to name a couple and he definitely doesnt disappoint with this one the score completely sets the tone and this film would not be the same without itfinally i must comment on nicholsons legendary performance jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer in fact just his stare steals a few scenes of this movie this is top-notch acting that must be seen to believethere will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one rip stanley<SEP>1
this movie is a great mocumentary it follows the rap group nwh made up of ice cold tasty taste and tone def through their unique path to gangster rap highs lows and back to highs through trouble with women egos cops and whitey this group gets to the top of the gangster rap world as this movie goes to the top of mocumentaries i know everybodies favorite mocumentary is this is spinal tap for very good reason however i think that if in the right mood this movie is simply better the laughs never end even for someone not into the rap cultureim a white guy that has no interest in rap music culture or anything else associated with it however i love this movie rusty cundeif who wrote the screenplay songs and starred in it showed great potential and it is a shame that i havent seen him since fear of a black hat however i have seen him one more time than you have and is that that i recommend fear of a black hat to you for quick laughsremember dont shoot to you see the whites!of their eyes no dont shoot to you see the whitesfym and enjoy the movie<SEP>1
while i dont agree with bobs and tammys decision to give up baby jesse and its something id never do they were trying to do what was best for the baby the way this movie is written you see yourself becoming wrapped up in the story and asking yourself what you really believe from all different aspects patty duke antagonist almost unheard of as far as im concerned but during the movie she really convinces you that shes psychotic or at least that theres something seriously wrong with her her character is the meaning of emotionally disturbed the movie seems to end quickly leaving things somewhat unresolved but other than that this movie is really great it really makes you think its not a movie to watch when you just want to kick back and relax and watch something cute thatll make you laugh but it is a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs see things from others perspectives and discover a little something about yourself caution: you may even grow while watching this movie! and its all worth it in the end<SEP>1
if youre as huge of a fan of an author as i am of jim thompson it can be pretty dodgy when their works are converted to film this is not the case with scott foleys rendition of after dark my sweet a suspenseful sexually charged noir classic that closely follows and does great justice to the original text jason patrick and rachel ward give possibly the best performances of their careers and the always phenomenal bruce dern might have even toped him self with this one like thompsons book this movie creates a dark and surreal world where passion overcomes logic and the double cross is never far at hand a must see for all fans of great noir film ****!!!<SEP>1
i have seen this movie many times and recently read the book the movie is based on and every time i see it i just want to slap all four of them the fact that they dont clue in to the fact that tom hanks character is flipping into his d&doops m&m : persona oh hes just acting in character outside of the gaming session that and the fact that after three months of therapy lets just destroy all that and feed his delusions! these kind of people are what give rpgs a bad namealso the corny love ballad and the music done by cat on a piano and stop us if we get too annoying are almost enough to set your teeth on edge!<SEP>0
i was reviewing some old vhs tapes i have and came across the tv show john denver & the muppets a christmas togetherthis made me go to my computer and look it up to see if i could find a dvd version of this show to buy i was disappointed not to be able to find it yet on dvd the show aired in 1979 and was a delightful show i have the record and the cd but i would love to buy a dvd version of this show the tape is old and picture quality is pretty good but fading the sound is not as good as the cd there is also a few other songs not put on the cd as a fan of john denver and of the muppets a dvd of this show would really be a good seller if you dont have the cd it is a wonderful chritmas collection of songs taken from that show the album is also good if you can find it and still have a record player to play it on<SEP>1
the best part of an american in paris is the lengthy ballet sequence at the end where gene kelly and leslie caron are the living personification of several major painters kelly has earlier been established as a pavement artist in paris so the sequence is the logical ending to a musical bursting with life and energy gershwin tunes and cast members like georges guetary and oscar levant kelly was at his best here - its a little different to singin in the rain and the effect of all the film as one topped with the ballet gives it a definite wow factor no wonder the sequence ended thats entertainment after all other mgm musical highlights had gone by!<SEP>1
ok even if you cant stand liza- this movie is truly hilarious! the scenes with john gielgud make up for liza one of the true romantic comedy classics from the 20th century dudley moore makes being drunk and irresponsible look cute and amusing and it is damn fun to watch! the one-liners are the best<SEP>1
i realize its not supposed to be bsg and i can handle slow-paced shows if theyre interesting but i find myself completely uninterested and bored with this seriesthe formula for bsg seemed to be: action + adventure + scifi + suspense + mystery + dramathe formula for caprica seems to be: bland drama + moderate scifimaybe it will get more interesting but as of episode 3 i can barely watch it in fact its at the bottom of my to-watch list for the week this is a sad state of affairs the syfi channel really destroyed their friday night lineup whatever happened to the glory days of sg1 stargate atlantis and bsg on friday nights they had a good thing there<SEP>0
awful simply awful it proves my theory about star power this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed battlestar titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick b o r i n gfind something a thousand times more interesting to do - like watch your tv with no picture and no sound 110 i rated it so high bc there arent any negative scores in the imdbcom rating system-zaphoidps: my theory about star power is: the more star power used in a show the weaker the show is its called an indirect proportionality: quality 1star power less sp makes for better quality etc another way to look at it is: more is less-z<SEP>0
beaudray demerillea weak peter fonda who also directed an aging gambler wins young teen wanda nevadapretty but not talented brooke shields in a poker game together the unlikely pairof courseembark on a search for indian gold in the grand canyonthats the story and there really is no need to search for a deeper meaning in it it just isnt there the acting is very weak too which was quite a surprise given the fact that peter fonda was in the leadif youre looking for something interesting in this film take a look at the nice scenery and some good looks of a young brooke shields her character however is so irritatingespecially at the beginningand dumb that she never quite comes off as sexy or appealing too bad but given the story i doubt anything more could be made of this i wonder why peter fonda directed and starred in this film he must have even talked his fatherhenry fondainto a useless cameo in this ridiculous mess unfortunately this was their only film together couldnt henry be in easy rider for example 310<SEP>0
this film isnt just about a school shooting in fact its never even seen but that just adds to the power this film has its about people and how they deal with tragedy i know it was shown to the students who survived the columbine shooting and it provided a sense of closure for a lot of them the acting is superb all three main actors busy phillips erika christensen and victor garber are excellent in their rolesi highly recommend this film to anyone its one of those films that makes you talk about it after you see it it provokes discussion of not only school shootings but of human emotions and reactions to all forms of tragedy it is a tear-jerker but it is well worth it and one i will watch time and time again<SEP>1
this film show peoples in the middle of the hottest 2 days in austria it shows people humiliating other peoples and being cruel to other peoples it show the inability of people to communicate or talk with othersin the screening i have attended people were leaving in the middle because they could no longer watch the film and rightly so because the film is not and easy one to watch it has a very depressing message and there isnt any moment of mercy in the film it is a very cruel movie not for everyones taste you can not speak of terms of enjoyment from this film it grips you in your throat and never let go and in the end you simply feels breathless because of its intensityi can not recommend or not recommend this film you should make your own mind based on what i have said earlier just be aware that this is not a regular film and it is not for everyones taste<SEP>1
let me first state that i enjoy watching bad movies its funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than the truly superb ones this film is bad in a disturbingly malicious way this vehicle for sam mraovichs delusional ego doesnt just border on talentless ineptitude it has redefined the very meaning of the words this should forever be the barometer for bad movies sort of the mendoza line for film mr mraovich writes directs and stars as blunt object arthur sailes battling scorned wives and the christian forces of evil as he and his partner ben dead behind the eyes sheets struggle for marital equality as a libertarian i believe gays should have a right to get married ben & arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of homophobes the portrayal of all things christian are so ugly and ham-fisted trademark mraovich that you cant possibly take any of them seriously arthurs brother victor the bible toting jesus freak is so horribly over-the-top evileffeminately gay that you have to wonder how he was cast in this role thats because sam multitasking mraovich was also casting director the worst of it all is sam mraovich himself when you think leading man do the words pasty balding and chubby come to mind sam also delivers lines like dominos pizza cold and usually wrong the final tally: you suck at writing directing acting and casting thats the ed wood quadruple crown congratulations you horrible little man<SEP>0
the movie had a good concept but the execution just didnt live up to itwhat is this concept well story-wise its dirty harry meets m a child killer has begun terrorizing a city the lead detectives dennis hopper and frederic forest have never dealt with a serial killer before the mayor and the police chief in desperation secretly hire the local mob to speed things upto go places and do things that the police wouldnt be able to in order to bring an end to this mess as soon as possibleto be fair this film does genuinely have some good things to offerbesides the concept i liked the look of the killers hideout norman bates has his basement this guy has an eerie sewer in some of the shots the light bounces off the water and creates rippling reflections on the walls; often giving these scenes a creepy dreamlike qualitythe acting was good too dennis hopper is one of those actors who gets better with ageonce you get past that however it more-or-less goes downhillthe film is paced way too fast the actual investigation process from both teams feels very rushed as opposed to feeling intricate and fascinating this could have been fixed in two ways: either make the film longer or cut out some of the many subplots either of these would have allowed the crew to devote more time to the actual mysteryfor an example of how bad this is one of the crucial clues that helps them zero in on just the right suspect is this: at one point in his life the suspect went to a pet shopthats rightim being totally serious here its like they went from point a the first clue to point z the suspect and skipped over all the in-between stepsthen theres the characters the only ones i actually liked were two pick-pockets you meet about half-way through the movie considering that theyre minor characters id call that a bad signfinally theres the mob angle this is the one that gets me the most because this is why i coughed up the $3 to buy the dvd in the first place i mean what a hook! theres been an absolute glut of serial killer flicks in the last 10-15 years the mob angle was a gimmick that could have helped it rise above the rest but it didnti figured the gangsterss methods would be brutal but fun and thrilling at the same time; kind of like a vigilante movie or somethingmaybe theyd even throw in some heist movie elements too we are talking about criminals after all instead were given some of the most repulsive protagonists committed to celluloid the detectives question witnesses what does the mob do they interrogate and kill them its not even like these witnesses are really even that bad either i actually found the criminals less likable than the killer theyre huntingunless the good points i mentioned are enough to get your interest id say give this one a miss maybe some day theyll reuse the same story idea and do it right i hope so i hate to see such a good concept go to waste<SEP>0
just watched this after my mother brought it back from america for me was dreading watching this after all the negative comments on here but i have to say yes the acting is cheesy some of the effects are laughablebut you have to remember this was meant to be 1898 not 2005 and for such a low budget i thought it was quite good i enjoyed this version much more then the spielberg version i saw last weeki have read the book so many times and found myself going ahh yes thats in the book almost all the time with the other version hardly anything of the book existedso well done for at least trying to make a true version<SEP>1
this interesting documentary tells a remarkable tale of an expedition to take blind tibetan children trekking in the himalayas; but also of a personality clash between two remarkable people on one hand there is erik weihenmeyer the first blind man to climb everest and the team of sighted mountaineers who are guiding the kids on the other there is sabriye tenberken a blind woman who runs the first school for blind tibetans who agrees to the expedition but subsequently has doubts about how it is progressing at some level sabine simply doesnt understand the mountaineers philosophy with its emphasis on summitting; she is probably right in identifying the mismatch between the mountaineers goals and the desires of the children but her certainty in her own correctness makes her a hard person to sympathise with especially as she has an effective veto in the background to this reasonably well-mannered clash we get an insight into the lives of the children themselves i enjoyed the film although it delivers a message clearly designed to be uplifting - even though it details the quarrel the film somewhat relentlessly asserts how amazing all those who feature in it are but its hard to argue with that assessment even if it is presented to the viewer somewhat unsubtly<SEP>1
this has got to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen i remember watching it years ago when it initially came out on video and for some strange reason i thought i enjoyed it so like an idiot i ran out to purchase the dvd once it was releasedwhat a tragic mistake! i wont even bother to go into the plot because it is so transparent that you can see right through it anyhow i am a fan of herschell gordon lewis so i am accustomed to cheesy gore effects and bad acting but these people take this to a whole different level it is almost as if they are intentionally trying to make the worst movie humanly possibleif that was their goal they suceeded if they intended to make a film that was supposed to scare you or make you believe in any way shape or form that it is real then they failedmiserably! avoid this movieread the plot synopsis and youve seen it!<SEP>0
i agree with everything people said on this one but i must add that the soundtrack is probably the worst one i have ever heard my entire life! there are actual vocals during times when you are supposed to be listening to the actors talk! and the vocals are like a broadway version of danzig singing the darkness of the forest! oh the darkness of the dark dark forest! or something else so unthreatening the singer has a terrible vibrato and has been recorded with a treble-y microphone over some synthed-up string section and fake drum beats its horrible!! yes the male leads are awful so are the female ones this is one bad case of gender stereotyping - its so bad! everything they say revolves around being a male or a female just playing up the stereotypes to the max makes me sick soooo boring!!! the children were so echoey in their lines you couldnt understand them and why do female ghost children always wear cute little bows in their hair pretty blue dresses and long hair and ghost boys always wear clean cut slacks with cute little shiny blond hair not scary - stupiddaddys face was way too blemish free and clean to be that of a man living in a cave nice beard and bangs pa did you perfectly cut those with a knife yourself or did you stroll into town and go to the salonstupid movie<SEP>0
i would have liked to write about the story but there wasnt any i would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but hinglish is only funny for like 5 minutes after that its overkill i would have liked to swoon over the keep-u-guessing suspense but it was as predictable as um mm a yash raj movie i would have liked to talk of the edge-of-the-seat action but i dont like cartoons much *sigh*all in all this movie is perfect for: 1 people attempting suicide - i promise itll push you over the edge 2 sado-masochists- this movie is way more effective than the barbed wire that silas guy in the da-vinci code wore 3 people researching alternative ways to spread terrorism - i swear the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in a mood to kill someone 4 movie piraters: more power to them if any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch - this is it 5barnacles most types of plankton & green algae - because almost all other living things would require an iq factor somewhat greater than what the movie offers afterthought: the director of the movie obviously is a species of his own and i hope to god that he is the only one of his kindone is enoughthings that could have made this a better movie: 1 a story 2 a choreographer 3 a screenplay writer 4 a stunt coordinator 5 a story did i already say that 6 a director - preferably one who is not mentally challenged although even one who was challenged could have done a better job 7 anil kapoor=bubonic plague - avoid at all costs 8 a statutory warning - watching yash raj movies is injurious to your mental health things i liked about the movie: 1 kareena kapoor - for obvious reasons 2 the english sub-titles - mera dil kho gaya becomes - my heart is in a void chaliya chaliya chaliya turns into im a flirt im a lover im a vagabond pricelessin short tashan to me is like the opposite of a rubrics cube - the cube is supposed to increase the iq of the player tashan promises to lower your iq and that in a mere 25 hours! woot!*sigh*but thats just me i could be wrong youve been warned anyways<SEP>0
polyester was the very first john waters film i saw and i have to say that it was also the worst movie i had seen up to that pointwaters group of talent included several people who i am sure worked for food and were willing to say the lines waters wrote every thing about the movie is terrible acting camera editing and the story about a woman played by 300 lb transvestite divine was purely absurdthat said i have to recommend this film because it is very funny and you wont believe the crap that happens to poor francine her son huffs solvents and stomps unsuspecting womens feet at the grocery store her daughter is the sluttiest slut in town her husband is a cackling a-hole of a pornographer who does everything in his power to embarrass and humiliate poor francinefrancines only friend is played by edith massey possibly the worst actress ever edith looks and sounds like she is reading the lines off a cue card and has never seen the script prior to filmingdespite all of francines travails waters cooks up a fabulous hollywood ending and everyone who survives lives happily ever after<SEP>0
dave devon sawa and his friends sam jason segel and jeff michael maronna have scammed their way through college when creepy ethan jason schwartzman discovers their secret he blackmails them into helping him score with beautiful good-hearted student angela james kingstupid and incompetent comedy - a lot more groan-inducing than laugh-inducing movie tries appealing to its target audience with its disgusting gags - but none of them work whats more its full of worthless unappealing characters - and schwartzmans character is so repulsive hes a major turn-off movie even tries using 50s60s sexpotactress mamie van doren in the movies most outrageous scene yuck!!!further bringing it down are its utter predictability and the waste yet again of veteran comedic actor joe flahertys talent - whens this guy going to stop accepting every role that comes along and do something worthwhileall in all the only thing i liked was james aka jaime king who was very appealing - and deserved betterthis gets no more than one out of ten from me<SEP>0
i loved the first two movies but this movie was just a waste of time and money for me and the studio im still wondering why they made this horrible movie the thing with the plastic gun and with the toy car that can go into another house are ridiculous joe pesci and daniel stern in the first two movies were so funny but the terrorists in this one are so stupid and not funny believe me this movie is just a waste of time<SEP>0

the original was a good movie i bought it on tape and have watched it several times and though i know that sequels are not usually as good as the original i certainly wasnt expecting such a bomb the romance was flat the sight gags old the spoken humor just wasnt this may not have been the worst movie ive ever seen but it comes close<SEP>0
brainless film about a good looking but brainless couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving tours the pair almost instantly make the wrong choice of customers and get mixed up with some people seeking to recover the items that we see falling to the ocean floor during the opening credits sequence great looking direct to video movie could have been so much better if it wasnt so interested in primarily looking good performances are serviceable and the plot is actually not bad or would have been had the director and producers not redirected the plot into making sure we see lots of shapely people in bathing suits or in what im guessing the reason for the unrated moniker a few fleeting bare breasts the film never generates any tension nor rises above the level of a forgettable tv movie if you get roped in to seeing this you wont pluck your eyes out since the eye candy is pleasant but we really need to stop producers from making films that are excuses to have a paid vacation<SEP>0
today i visited an athenean cinema with my two kids 6 & 8 years old payed 3 x 12 euros about 45 us $ total not to mention gas popcorn & soda was asked to return my 3d special glasses after leaving the theater and was forced to watch what could have been a great 3d movie masterpiece but only proved to be a sick cold war like propaganda movie like none i have seen during the last 20 years and this is supposed to be a movie for children in heavens name! ps 1: the average working greek makes no more than 850 euros a month approxiamtely 1050 us $ ps 2 my kids liked it but then again they are no more than babies >in greek: mora morons > like the one who wrote the script & the others who made this 3d disgrace happenps 3 3d animation is fantastic but who gives a !<SEP>0

anyone who loved the two classic novels by edward ormondroyd will be disappointed in this film all the magic and romance have been modernized out of his original story of a girl who does a good deed for a mysterious old lady and given three in return three what not three wishes but three rides into the 1800s on a rickety elevatorthe first novel is time at the top the second is all in good time<SEP>0
this movie was recommended to me by a friend i never saw an ad or a trailer so i didnt know clooney was in it and was not bothered by the fact that his role was so small i thought the whole cast was suitable and found the film pretty enjoyable all in all the opening scene with the small crew of bandits standing at the side of the road looking whipped and haggard caught my attention immediately it had a way of telling you dont go away; this wont be boring and it really wasnt it turned out to be an interesting light-hearted comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you in your seat to the very end but when the ending did arrive i felt a little bit cheatedjust a little bit the events kept building up so that you expect them to continue building but at a point that i cant define it sort of levels out making the ending a slight disappointment i reckon i expected a bigger bang of a climax but it turned out sort of low-key if you watch the movie with that in mind and you can live without high dosages of george clooney you should find this flick very entertaining and well worth watching now id like to see the original big deal on madonna street but its probably a rare find in the united states<SEP>1
this is a terrible production of bartleby though not as the other reviewer put it because it is unfilmable but rather because this version does not maintain the spirit of the book it tells the story almost painfully so watching it i could turn the pages in my book and follow along which is not as much fun when dealing with an adaptation rather see the 2001 version of bartleby featuring crispin glover that version while humorous brings new details to the film while maintaining the spirit of the novel whats important is the spirit not the minutiae of things like setting character names and costumes the difference between these film versions is like night and day tedious and hilarious this version is a lesson as to what can go wrong if an adaptation is handled poorly painful mind-numbing schlock<SEP>0
im not going to criticize the movie there isnt that much to talk about it has good animal actions scenes which were probably pretty astonishing at the time clyde beatty isnt exactly a matinée idol hes a little slight and not particularly good looking but thats ok hes the man in that lion cage we know that when he cant take the time away from his lions to tend to his girlfriend he will end up on an island with her and have to save the day someone said earlier that it is a history lesson the scenes at the circus are of another day especially the kids who hang around i didnt realize that even back in the thirties they sailed on three masted schooners it looked like something out of 1860 i guess thats the stock footage they had no wonder the thing got wrecked theyre always talking about fixing her up theres even a dirigible it tells us a little about male female relationships at the time a kind of giggly silliness but if you dont take it too seriously you can have fun watching it<SEP>0
went to watch this movie expecting a nothing really much action flick still got very disappointed the opening scene promised a little action with a tinge of comedy it keeps you hooked for the first half coz till then you are expecting that now its time for the action to kick in well nothing of that sort happens the movie drags and the ending just thumps you down to a point that you get annoyedwonder what was the director thinking made no sense watsoever the movie lacked in all aspects had no real storyline and it seemed very hollow even if rambo was in it i dont think he could have helped the rating at all there is simply no logic to the movie a perfect way to waste your time and money by far the most irritating movie i have ever seen and i am sure there will b others wholl have the same viewpoint after enduring it definitely not for people who have a little movie sense left in them<SEP>0
i have not seen this movie! at least not in its entirety i have seen a few haunting clips which have left me gagging to see it all one sequence remains in my memory to this day a very convincing looking spacecraft is orbiting the dark side of the moon the pilot releases a flash device in order to photograph the hidden surface below him the moon flashes into visability and for a few seconds there it is parallel lines squares could it be then the light fades and the brief glimse of what has gone and it is time for the spacecraft to return to earth wonderful i have seen some other clips too but would love to obtain the full movie<SEP>1
every so often a movie comes along that knocks me down a notch and reminds me that my taste in films i seek out to watch isnt always impeccable i normally would stay away from stuff like this but i was duped by some glowing reviews and the rohmer pedigreetheres an initial and intriguing novelty to the production where rohmer essentially superimposes the actors onto painted digital back-drops of revolution era france this quickly wanes and becomes about as interesting as watching the paint dry on a paint by numbers scene what were left with is a boring and stuffy film about aristocrats in 18th century france none of the characters are appealing or sympathetic the pace is so languid the dialogue so arduous and suspense is clearly a foreign concept to rohmer that i ended up not caring whose head rolled who was harboring who or what the devil the revolution was supposed to be about the movie wouldve greatly benefited from some semblance of emotional build-up and a music score theres some fine classical music used at the very end despite being so talky the film plays much like a silent film and the worst kind of film at that a dull and uninteresting film about infinitely interesting subjects only the most astute french historians will find anything to take from this film as it dose seem to paint well known events from a new angle the lady is english and a royalist otherwise avoid this yawner at all costs unless you are suffering from insomnia i dozed off twice<SEP>0
this is an interesting idea gone bad the hidden meanings in art left as clues by a serial killer sounds intriguing but the execution in anamorph is excruciatingly slow and without much interest there is no other way to describe the film except boring the death clues are the only interesting part of anamorph everything connecting them is tedious willem dafoe gives a credible performance as the investigator but he has little to do with a script that is stretched to the limit several supporting character actors are wasted including peter stormare as the art expert james rebhorn as the police chief paul lazar as the medical examiner and most notably deborah harry who is featured on the back of the dvd case yet only has a couple lines spoken through a cracked door not recommended - merk<SEP>0
maybe i loved this movie so much in part because ive been feeling down in the dumps and its such a lovely little fairytale whatever the reason i thought it was pitch perfect great intelligent story beautiful effects excellent acting especially de niro who is awesome this movie made me happier than ive been for a whileit is a very funny and clever movie the running joke of the kingdoms history of prince savagery and the aftermath the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled thats much of what makes it so good; its an elaborate special-effects-laden movie with more story than most fairytale movies yet there is an incredible attention to small thingsi feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again<SEP>1
one of my favorite twilight zone episodes and the next day we were in the supermarket at hollywood blvd and la brea my father and i and guess who was coming toward us in the aisle! barney phillips but no hat on -- at least i dont think he had a hat onwe asked him about his third eye and he said something like he left it at home and everybody he met that day had asked him about ita friendly guy we used to see all kinds of character actors in la in those daysbtw i was a teenager and it took a long time for me to get over the three hands on the other alien! robyn frisch oneill hollywood native and resident 1947 to 1963<SEP>1
this film has been receiving a lot of play lately during the day on either hbo or cinemax the reason is that they are assuming people would be interested in comparing it to the leonardo dicapriotom hanks caper of the same name the only reason to see it is for the attractive matt lattanzi yum! although i must say matt was more than a little long in the tooth to be playing a high schooler if he were a woman theyd have had him playing the mother of a high schooler! is is just me or is his daughter starting to look like shelley duvall oh yeah the plot--who cares typical teen highjinx played by adults<SEP>0
everyone knows about this zero day event what i think this movie did that elephant did not is that they made us see how these guys were they showed their life for about a year throughout the movie we get to like them to laugh with them even though we totally know what theyre gonna do and that gives me the chills cause i felt guilty to be cheered by their comments and i just thought cal was a sweet guy even though i knew what was gonna happen you know even at the end of the movie when they were about to commit suicide and just deciding if they did it on the count of 3 or 4 i thought this was funny but still i was horrified to see their heads blown off of course i was i got to like them they were wicked maybe but i felt like they were really normal guys that they didnt really realize it but i knew they werethats imo the main force of this movie it makes us realize that our friends or relatives or anyone can be planning something crazy and that we wont even notice it this movie as good as it was made me feel bad and thats why i cant go to sleep right now theres still this little feeling in my stomach butterflies<SEP>1
ba ba ba boring this is next to battlefield earth in science fiction slumberness genie francis aka general hospitals laura has a small role as a reporter and that in itself should tell you that this movie must be bad there is ben kingsley an academy award winning actor in this stinker and a few others decent actors you have to wonder what possessed them to decide to do this awful movie the music dramatically goes up and down like its a major dramatic story even if you pay attention the plot is impossible to follow the effects are mediocre as well and seem really dated all of the actors speak in a monotone voice and have no realism to their dialogue i could go on and on on how this is a bad movie at least with battlefield earth its so bad its funny but this is just b o r i n g avoid unless you want to be lulled to sleep<SEP>0
is there a book titled how to make a movie with every man vs nature cliché imaginable if not ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on killer insects ants doesnt have one shred of originality to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime i suppose the most surprising thing about ants is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes the set-up the characters the various sub-plots the death scenes and the way the ants are presented have been done before any number of times  and in most cases much better its amazing that so many of these insects on a rampage films were made in the 70s because theyre all basically the same movieand can someone please tell me what in gods name myrna loy is doing in this monkey-turd of a movie a woman as talented and classy as loy deserved better than ants as one of her final movies<SEP>0
my fondness for chris rock varies with his moviesi hated him after lethal weapon 4but i hated everyone in that movie after iti like him when he is himself and not holding backlike in dogma well this is his best yetwasnt expecting this to be that goodlaughed my arse off the whole time chris rock delivers a sweet wonderful story backed by some of the funniest comedy ive seen in quite some time loved it<SEP>1
picked this up for 50 cents at the flea market was pretty excitedi found it fascinating for about 15 min then just repetitive and dullit is neat seeing mick and the gang in their prime i wish there was not so much over dubbing of dialog so i could hear what there are saying and playingthe skits are politically dated and incredibly naive and simple sort of poorly written monty python on acid i spent more time looking at the late 60s england back drops rather then what was actually happening in the silly skitsthis movie is a good reminder that times really changeand what was important quickly becomes just plain silly good song but it has now been played to death by this dvd<SEP>0
i saw the big bad swim at the 2006 temecula film festival and was totally caught off guard by how much i was drawn into itthe film centers around the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class for various reasons a humorous idea in its own right the class serves as a catalyst for greater changes in the students liveswhat surprised me about the film was how real it felt rarely in ensemble pieces are characters treated so well i enjoyed the scenes in the class immensely and the drama that took place outside was very poignant nothing seemed out of place or out of character and ultimately it left a very strong feeling much like attending school or summer camp - where you find fast friends form strong bonds and make discoveries about yourself yet have to depart all too soonmy only complaint was that the character of paula had a very strong and unusual introduction which made you want to know a little more about her than was ultimately revealed i suppose you dont get to meet everyone in class thoughaside from this i found the film very well-rounded and quite enjoyable see it if you get the opportunity<SEP>1
the secret of kells is a film ive been waiting for for years after seeing some early footage at the cartoon saloon in kilkenny im here to tell you now its been worth the wait the cartoons are heavily stylised but not annoyingly so as id feared the whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination i particularly love the animated illuminated book where the little figures come to life on the page the characterisation is superb i love brendan gleesons voice as the stern abbot and i especially liked the voice of the sprite aisling the forest is a triumph such a beautiful place the story is well realised a mix of fact and fantasy and really draws the viewer in to cheer on brendan in his quest for the perfect materials for the book im a lover of calligraphy and illumination anyway so the subject is close to my heart but all the people i know whove seen this and are not fans of the craft agree that its a lovely little film i will definitely buy the dvd when its released and would like to say well done cartoon saloon and all the people involved in this mammoth project may there be many more : coming back in here to say that i bought several copies of the dvd as soon as i could and gave them out at christmas everyone loves it! and i wish them all the luck in the world at the oscars such a joy to see this nominated<SEP>1
this series could very well be the best britcom ever and that is saying a great deal considering the competitors fawlty towers good neighbours to name just twowhat made butterflies so superior even to the best of the best is that it did not just exemplify great classic classy and intelligent comedy but it also expanded horizons reflecting - flawlessly gently and at every detail - the great social change that was occurring in britain at the timei remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it the lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself this was the first time i saw real people using cordless phones and the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies attire still seen in north america at the time then there were the decors shop fronts cars these people - even the layabout sons with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor - were sophisticated they were examples of the new europeans that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade 1980sof course the premise was strange and fantastic the idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so discontent and restless was revolutionary particularly to north americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things sure the situation was depicted in american movies and tv but not with the intensity of butterflies or the movie montenegro and if the premise was not surprising enough the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme a potential affair that was not really about sex or even romance butterflies dazzled many but it must have left some people smacking their foreheads in disbelief at the time anywaybutterflies turned out to be - in so many ways - prophetic it documented ahead of its time - post-modern ennui all-pervasive lifestyle the notion of emotional infidelity and generational disconnect and male discontent portrayed perfectly by the strained father-son relationships it is too bad this series has not been rediscovered in a big way and all those involved given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place and foreseeing all the slickness and angst that was to come<SEP>1
it was such a treat when this show was on because it was such a fresh innovative and original show this makes every show ive ever watched look plain boring the moment the first episode aired i was entranced and i became attached to all the characters so easy which usually never happens because i always hate a few characters it is a pity this show wont have a third season because it has to be one of the best shows i have ever seen and that isnt exaggerating my feelings for the show at all nothing can ever replace pushing daisies because what could abc possibly find to replace this show this is easily the best show on television i came for kristin chenoweth and i stayed because i fell in love with the entire show<SEP>1
basically take the concept of every asian horror ghost movie and smash it into one and you get this movie the story goes like this: a bunch of college kids get voice mails from their own phones that are foretelling their deaths theres some s*** going on with ghosts which if youve seen any asian ghost movie isnt scary by now this movie was quite upsetting because its very clichéd its the same bullcrap different moviethe acting was pretty good unfortunately the actors are put into a very ring-esquire situation so its nothing we havent seen in the past the two lead acts did a solid job thoughas far as gore theres not much going on we get a cool sequence that includes an arm twisting a head off i dont know how else to explain that but it was cut away so you dont see anything except the final result you see some blood at times including decapitated arms and a zombie that looked really cool i might add but this movie isnt too bloodythe scares in the movie are few and spread out and its really not that scary youll get some creepy images at times but its not enough for me to consider scary its nothing different from ringu ju-on or dark water and none of those scared me either thats really the downfall of this and most asian horror movies is that if it doesnt deliver the scares then its just not that goodas far as directing takashi miike still did a pretty good job he seemed a little tamed in this movie compared to his past movies but he still portrays a lot of his messed up style hes become famous for a lot of images were a lot like miike including a scene with a bunch of jars of dead fetuses and the last 15 - 20 minutes seemed far more miike then the rest of the movie still the movie is flawed by its unoriginalityi would recommend this only to people who are huge on asian horror movies even if you are i can recommend much better or big miike fans warning to those who want to get into miike this is not his best workim giving it a 4 because its just mediocre perhaps if this was released 4 or 5 years ago it might be worth a higher ratingalso id like to b**** about asian horror movies real quick how come if its an asian horror movie its automatically suppose to be good over here us a lot of these movies are the equivalent in japan to what scream urban legends and i know what you did last summer were over here in the 90s if youve seen one youve seen them all and a lot of these movies rely way too much on scares and imagery that if it doesnt deliver the scares they set out to do then theyre just not that good and nothing would change that more asian horror films need to be more like audition and a tale of two sisters two movies that if they dont frighten or scare you at least they have great stories acting direction cinematography and much more to back them up two movies that arent just great horror movies but great movies in general more asian horror movies need to be like these instead of the cliché a ghost just wanted to be found so it went around killing people through their phonevideo tapehouseelectric appliancewater pipesgoogle search enginevibratorgroceriesetc<SEP>0
here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea that is the problem isnt the concept is fresh and full of potential but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance it should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions get you interested and invested in the characters this movie doesnt have what it takes to take off and sustain flight and here is why first you dont really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to i mean this is not superman or mission impossible here its suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation they are not believable in the way they act and interact example : jeffrey combs as a cop over chewing is gum frowning and looking intense all the time isnt the way to go here i mean what is that he looks like hes on the toilet or something i loved him in re-animator and the way he was playing the intenseneurotic unappreciated medical genius was right on the money but not for this he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner its not natural im surprised he didnt dislocate his jaw during filming the movie is basically on life support it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that would never come<SEP>0
i think that movie can`t be a scott`s film that is impossible do you remember blade runner and alien two greats movies versus a one i hope didn´t see ever it good bye!!<SEP>0

this movie is a good example of how to ruin a book in 109 minutes except for the names of the characters the movie bears very little resemblance to the book a book full of strong latino characters and they are represent for the most part by non-latinos there is no character development in the movie and we have no reason to love or hate the characters and to delete a complete generation is inexcusable isabel allende has written a powerful book and the book is what should be read!<SEP>0
ealing studios a television and film production company based in west london claims to be the oldest film studio in the world though it has been consistently churning out films and television programmes since the 1930s its golden age was most certainly between 1948 and 1955 when it produced a string of comedy masterpieces many starring the great alec guinness such well-known titles include whisky galore! 1949 passport to pimlico 1949 kind hearts and coronets 1949 the lavender hill mob 1951 the titfield thunderbolt 1953 and the ladykillers 1955 one of ealing studios most beloved films the man in the white suit was released in 1951 and starred alec guiness as sidney stratton a brilliant inventor who engineers a remarkable fabric an invention that unexpectedly makes him more enemies than friendssidney stratton is poor and unappreciated but he has scientific talent in great abundance due to his under-qualification the only jobs he is able to get are as a janitor or labourer at any of the large textile factories where he secretly undertakes his own experiments using the companys own money and equipment after being found out and ejected countless times sidney is convinced that he is only weeks away from a momentous scientific discovery that will revolutionise the textiles industry encouraged by his daughter daphne joan greenwood textile mill owner alan birnley cecil parker takes a keen interest in sidneys exploits and agrees to finance any further work after numerous failed attempts and quite a few earth-shattering explosions sidney eventually unveils his amazing creation: an almost-luminous white fabric that never gets dirty and never wears outif sidney thought that his invention would make him a hero then he was sorely disappointed the all-powerful bosses of textiles industry headed by the frail sir john kierlaw ernest thesiger unite to ensure that the revolutionary invention which could completely cripple their businesses never goes into full-scale production likewise the humble labourers in the workers union hear of sidneys creation and also set out to erase it from existence fearing for their jobs the inventor however is convinced that the ever-lasting fabric will bring relief and happiness to many and refuses to give in to the demand of others despite being threatened with violence and offered ₤250000 in compensation throughout all his troubles to announce his invention to the media only one person offers sidney her complete sympathy and support birnleys daughter daphne who is engaged to be married to somebody else but falls in love with sidneys plight anywaythe man in the white suit is a clever and hilarious comedy made great by a witty script written by john dighton roger macdougall and director alexander mackendrick and a quirky and charismatic performance from an inimitable alec guinness there are also a few good-natured swipes at capitalism and of how big industries can hold back progress for the sake of their own monetary situations though we can certainly see the arguments for either side of the debate<SEP>1
so prom night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie im a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning but upon seeing it it is neither horror or thrilleri was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable you could predict what was going to happen next the young actors were alright at playing their characters but id have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting wiseyes ill give props for the plot because it was good but its not thrilling or scary there were almost zero jump-in-your-seat scenes so dont waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres wait til it comes to dvd<SEP>0
warning! spoilers ahead! spoilers ive seen movie in german so it might be that i missed some clues despite some weakness in the plot its a movie that came through to me i liked especially lexa doigs acting sometimes i got impression that she *is* camille but i cant stop wondering what happened at the end with bob cassie and baby i belive she after initially being set on bob eventually ended up loving him and regretting what happened with his brother and being forced to lie to him otherwise its a bit strange that she would carry his baby and love it its up to viewer to decide - and i dont like such endings dean cain was as good as ever eric roberts well ive seen him better but also worse i believe that the film is more an analysis of human relations and reacting in unexpected situations than a crime story bottom line is i liked it very much<SEP>1
the booth puts a whole new twist on your typical j-horror movie this movie puts you in the shoes of the protagonist of the story the director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thinksthe story is about perception of the people who works lives and loves of our protagonist and how he perceives the people who surrounds him in an antiquated radio station dj booth the story peels back the layers of the main character like an onion in flash-backs as the movie runs its course and from it we learned that things are not always the way it seems the movie mostly took place in a small out-dated radio stations studio with a very bad history where the main character was forced to broadcast his talk show due to the radio station was in the process of re-locating it is from this confined space that this movie thrives and makes you feel very claustrophobic and very paranoid at time our protagonist can not determined the strange happenings in the old studio were caused by ghost or some conspiracy by his co-workers or it was all in his mind what i like about this film is that the film-makers makes you see through the eyes of the main character and makes you just as paranoid as protagonist did this movie is a very smart abide rather short 76 minutes film<SEP>1
a small pleasure in life is walking down the old movies aisle at the rental store and picking stuff just because i havent seen it a large pleasure is occasionally taking that movie home and finding a small treasure like this playing on my screenlong before elia kazan turned himself into a brand cranking out only notable movies not good ones he made this better than average drama watching it you begin to notice how many decent good or nicely observed scenes have accumulated contrast that with his later films where the drama is writ large preferably large and unsubtle and scandalous kazan was eventually more of a calculating promoter than a director um no thanks his future excesses are hinted at here only in the plot the plague is coming! but heres an atypical richard widmark playing a family man in 1951 and avoiding most of the excesses of that trope; heres an almost watchable barabra bel geddes with her bathos turned way down well for her; theyre a couple and they share some nicely-written scenes about big crises and smaller ones heres an expertly directed comic interrogation with a chatty ships-crew; heres a beautiful moment as a chase begins at an angular warehouse and a flock of birds shoots overhead punctuating the moment these are the small-scale successes a movie can offer in which a viewer can actually recognize life; something hollywood in its greed now studiously avoids these are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them its a personable human-scaled film not the grotesque overscaled production that he and others david lean will later popularize whose legacy is still felt in crap as varied as pirates of the caribean and moulin rougei just watched it twice and ill be damned if i could tell you what jack palance is seeking in the final scenes but it doesnt seem that important to me as a viewer this reminds me of both no way out a poitier noir with widmark as the villain and naked city which you should really get your hands on<SEP>1
the toy box 1971 bombsure i like looking at nude women while i prefer hardcore porn flicks ill take softcore exploitation grindhouse junk like this too under the right circumstances well these arent the right circumstances these arent any circumstances theres supposed to be a horrific subplot lurking in here somewhere but ill be damned if i can untangle it this is another of those amateurish steaming piles of badly made manure that bores you to tears rather than stimulates you despite all the simulated sex going on all over the place bah -- if i want to see good sex scenes ill watch the real stuff<SEP>0
bamboo house of dolls 1973 1974 or 1977 various years are given for this title is a hong kong veteran chin hung kueis killer snakes boxers omen payment in blood etc women in prison flick produced by the legendary shaw brothers yes even they got their hands into low exploitation sickies like this and bamboo is definitely among the worse attempts of the whole genre even when compared to the western attempts that usually pale in comparison with the eastern films!the story is about a japanese war camp in which the chinese women are brutalized abused and raped by the bad japanese what else during the world war ii the girls also know a secret place in which a box full of gold is hidden and also learn that a chinese military officer raised in japan shaw veteran lo lieh is actually now an undercover agent among the other japanese and naturally helps the girls escape the hell what follows is sequences full of gratuitous nudity female kung fu some nasty torture gore sleaze and extremely offensive anti japan attitude that make this film pure and honest garbage that doesnt even try to be more than it isthere are hardly any interesting elements in bamboo house of dolls the occasional photography especially at the end looks nice with its sunbeams and beautiful nature but thats about it in the merits department the fight scenes are plenty and always include half naked females hitting and kicking each other the violence overall is quite nasty at times with several bullet wounds misogynistic torture scenes for example one poor girl is brutalized on the floor filled with broken glass etc and extremely repulsive ending and moral behind it of course it is stupid to talk about moral when writing about this kind of film but still there are elements i wont accept to be found from any filmthe film has also some enjoyable turkey elements for sure! for example the gold box filled with heavy gold seems suspiciouly light as the weak and suffered girls dont seem to have any problems lifting and moving it not to speak of throwing it! also those numerous skin fight scenes make this quite smile inducing for fans of trash cinema i have seen the same directors killer snakes 1973 which is ten times more noteworthy as a piece and even though it has many alive snakes killed for real it is also visually more interesting and shows us some nasty sides of the other side of the big city and society also it is a must for those who fear snakesbamboo house of dolls has suffered some censorship too which isnt a surprise considered the subject matter the uncut version dubbed into a non-english language released in europe at least in france italy and switzerland runs 104 pal minutes while the cut english dubbed print released in holland belgium and greece runs only 84 minutes in pal from what ive heard the cut scenes are not only violence or other graphic stuff but also dialogue and plot development and the likebamboo house of dolls is garbage cinema in its most trashy form and definitely something i wouldnt have liked to see from the shaw brothers or hong kong in general some of the italian exploitation films of the same subject matter are much more interesting and noteworthy than this quite ridiculous calculated and worthless piece of cinema exploitation 210<SEP>0
spielbergs first dramatic film is no let-down its a beautifully made film without any flaws about the life of an african-american woman it also proves that not all movies that have the african-american ethnicity as the center of the story have to be helmed by an african-american directorwhat i love about this movie is spielbergs ability to make it very realistic despite the fact that it was based on a book furthermore danny glover was excellent as mr and usually hes just himself throughout most of his movies but in this he completely branches out and is someone else for once but the performance de resistance of the whole film comes from whoopi goldberg she is excellent as celie you will never forget these characters once youve seen this movienow i heard that the musical version of it is going to be a film as well and all i can say is: i hope its about as good as this one is because this one is a film that shouldnt be missed<SEP>1
this movie looked good - good cast evergreen topic and an explosive opening it went downhill from there why was it filmed by hand held camera it shakes judders part captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer a poor choice indeed as if this was not enough the worst edit in memory assumes a drugged viewer - mandatory if you want to get any enjoyment from it at all and then it commits the worst sin of all after leading the viewer down all sorts of unlikely and implausible scenarios to the point of exhaustion they roll credits without revealing the denouement - the ending - the payoff -like what the heck was the motive how can you expect to succeed by making thrillers without an ending doh! this movie had great promise and ending up doing a face plant in the mud what a waste of effort poor effort by writer and director<SEP>0
the running man is often dismissed as being just another arnie action thriller full of explosions bad puns and gunfire and to be fair there is a lot of that in it people used to look at it and compare it to the terminator series saying it was one of the poorer schwarzenegger filmsbut give it 18 years and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light rather than just being another brainless action film it works very well as a parody of reality tv it is quite different to the stephen king book true but i doubt whether hollywood with its love of upbeat endings and so-called ordinary guys who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando would have accepted it in its current formbut on with the reviewben richards arnold schwarzenegger is a cop working in a dystopian united states where democracy is a thing of the past and the entire country is ruled by a governmentmedia conglomerate amalgamation the economy is in tatters food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to watch like jumping for dollars where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs and the most popular one is the running man a gameshow hosted by the slimy damian killian played by the entertaining richard dawson where supposed criminals are hunted down by theatrical pro-wresting-esquire stalkerssome however try and speak up against the government when a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of bakersfield california a helicopter piloted by richards is sent to calm ie kill the protest when richards refuses to fire on innocent people he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd he is sentenced to a slave labour camp but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader yaphet kotto and goes on the runhowever his freedom does not last long and after he kidnaps network employee amber mendez marita conchita alonso in an attempt to escape those pursuing him he finds himself taken prisoner again but this time he is forced to appear on the running manand there of course the entire film kicks into standard arnie mode richards is launched into the post-apocalyptic wasteland of los angeles why is la always destroyed in these dystopian worlds and forced to run from the stalkers along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labour camp with him amber also becomes curious about richards protestations of innocence and discovers he was framed guess what happens to her then so as amber richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the stalkers we soon become aware that richards is no ordinary cop hes super arnie the unkillable one man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in christmas lights all while being just your average american guy with an austrian accentyes the remainder of the film becomes dumb loud classic 80s arnie fun theres a lot of exciting fight sequences the trademark dreadful puns he had to split being my favourite and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending its a lot of fun watching killian react to it in the typical wholesome gameshow host way as well and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host watch out for the cursing old lady! and the cold cyncial man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratingsif you expect a high-brow intelligent film youll be disappointed but if you want a great 80s flick well this is it but the great thing about this film is it was quite propheticif you look at the entertainment we have today youll have noticed the way reality tv is going nowadays - shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on tv its not too far a leap to imagine that some vile tv exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on tv weve already had that however with the ghoulish al-qaida hostage beheading videos posted on the internet it seems that in the current climate at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television setswith that in mind and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s you have to be impressed by the far-sightedness of this film of course we havent reached there yet as its terrorists rather than the mainstream media who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death but you just have to wonder how long it is before some exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching a show that combines peoples desire for entertainment and desire to indulge their morbid curiosity<SEP>1

this was one of the worst films i have ever seeni usually praise any film for some aspect of its production but the intensely irritating behaviour of more than half the characters made it hard for me to appreciate any part of this filmmost common was the inference that the bloke who designed the building was at fault an avalanche collapsing it er okalso trying to out ski an avalanche slalom style is not gonna work running 10 feet into some trees is not gonna work alas it does here as mentioned before the innate dumbness and sheer stupidity of some characters is ridiculous in an enclosed space with limited oxygen a four year old could tell you starting a fire is not a good ideaanyway about 5 minutes of the movie redeems itself and acquires some appreciation however if you have a modicum of intelligence you too will find most of this film hard to tolerateit pains me that so many quality stories go unproduced and yet someone will pay for things like this to be madeoh did i mention the last five minutes well to give you a hook you have to keep watching in order to see the latest in combative avalanche techniques absolutely priceless<SEP>0

this is a most handsome film the color photography is beautiful as it shows the lavishness of the metropolitan opera house in brilliant color other indoor scenes at various mansions etc are equally brilliant as for the music what more can be said other than that lanzas voice was at its peak as he sang so many of the worlds best known and beloved arias the marvelous dorothy kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice blends with that of lanza in delightful harmony of course hollywood took their customary liberties with the life story of caruso there is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events for example the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and bear no relationship to the truth there are some very good web sites that tell the true story of caruso and contain several pictures of him these web sites can be located by using any good search engine there are also several books available concerning his life history but the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film the voices of lanza kirsten and the chorus members are the real stars of this movie enjoy i know that i sure did<SEP>1
to call this episode brilliant feels like too little to say it keeps up the excellent work of the season premiere is reductive too cause theres never been a far-from-great sopranos episode so far in fact the title might be a smug invitation for those who arent real fans yet: join the clubpicking up where junior left off putting a bullet in his nephews gut after mistaking him for a crook he killed in the first season the story begins with tony being absolutely fine with no recollection whatsoever of what happened to him hes attending some kind of convention only hes not speaking with his normal accent and there seems to be something wrong with his papers: apparently he is not tony soprano but kevin finnerty or at least thats what a group of people think and until the mess is sorted out he cant leave his hotelnaturally in pure sopranos tradition that turns out to be nothing but a dream: tony is actually in a coma with the doctors uncertain regarding his fate his family and friends worried sick and junior refusing to believe the whole thing actually happened unfortunately it did and anthony jr looks willing to avenge the attempt on his fathers lifedreams have popped up rather frequently in the series often as some kind of spiritual trial for the protagonists most notably in the season five show the test dream join the club however takes the metaphysical qualities of the program already hinted at by the previous episodes use of a william s burroughs poem and pushes the envelope in the most audacious way: tony hallucinating about his dead friends the first occurrence of the sort was caused by food poisoning four seasons ago is one thing him actually being in what would appear to be purgatory is radically different the heavenly section of the story is crammed with allegorical significances not least the name tony is given as one character points out spelling it in a certain way will give you the word infinity and none of it comes off as overblown or far-fetched: david chase has created a piece of work that is far too intelligent to use weird set-ups just for their own sake; it all helps the narrative talking about help from above in the case of tony soprano might be stretching it a tad though<SEP>1
okay so there is a front view of a checker taxi probably late 1930s model it has the great triangular shaped headlights there also is a desoto cab in this black and white character driven almost a musical love gone wrong storythe real pleasure here is the look at 1940s room interiors and fashions and hotel elevators the hair styles male and female are gorgeous if dolly parton had victor matures hair she could have made it big there is an artist loft that would be the envy of every andy warhol wannabeif you watch this expecting a great casablanca storyline or sound of music oom-pah-pah you will be disappointed there is a nice little story beneath the runway model approach in this filmmy copy on dvd with another movie for $1 was very viewable the title sequence was cute but not up there with mad mad mad mad world or the pink panther this was an rko movie but it did not have the nice airplane logo that rko used to usei liked victor mature in one million bc and sampson and delilah and especially in violent saturday see if you can find that one he was wonderful in the comedy with peter sellers called caccia alla volpe or after the foxrichard carlson went on to do i led three lives on tv in the early 1950svic mature was offered the part of sampsons father in the remake of sampson and delilah he supposedly was asked if he would have any problems playing the part of the father since he was so well known as sampson victor replied if the money is right ill play sampsons mother tom willett<SEP>1
vijay krishna acharyas tashan is a over-hyped stylized product sure its a one of the most stylish films but when it comes to content even the masses will reject this one why the films script is as amateur as a 2 year old baby script is king without a good script even the greatest director of all-time cannot do anything tashan is produced by the most successful production banner yash raj films and mega stars appearing in it but nothing on earth can save you if you script is bland thumbs down! performances: anil kapoor is a veteran actor but how could he okay a role like this akshay kumar is great actor in fact hes the sole saving grace kareena kapoor has never looked so hot she looks stunning and leaves you all stand up saif ali khan doesnt get his due in here sanjay mishra manoj phawa and yashpal sharma are wastedtashan is a boring film the films failure at the box office should you keep away<SEP>0
i really liked this movie and went back to see it two times more within a weekms detmers nailed the performance - she was like a hungry cat on the prowl toying with her prey she lashes out in rage and lust taking a too young lover and crashing hundreds of her terrorist fiancés mothers pieces of fine china to the floor the film was full of beautiful touches the maserati the wonderful wardrobe the flower boxes along the rooftops i particularly enjoyed the ancient greek class and the recitation of antigoneit had a feeling of story of o - that is where people of means indulge in unrestrained sexual adventure as she walks around the fantastic apartment in the buff she is at ease - and why not what is to restrain a devil in the fleshthe whole movie is a real treat!<SEP>1
ok first of all i am a huge zombie movie fan i loved all of romeros flicks and thoroughly enjoyed the re-make of dawn of the dead so when i had heard every single critic railing this movie i was still optimistic i mean critics hated resident evil and while it may not be a particularly great film i enjoyed it if not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shoot-em up with a half decent plot this however is pure crap terrible dialogue half-assed plot and video game scenes inserted into the film who in their right mind thought that was a good idea the only thing about this movie i use the term loosely that i enjoyed was jurgen prochnow as captain kirk ugh while his name throws originality out the window you can see in his performance that he knows hes in a god awful film and he might as well make the best of it everyone else acts as if theyre doing shakespeare and very badly i might add basically the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you a are a huge zombie buff and must see every zombie flick made or b like to play mst3k the home game see it with friends and be prepared for tons of unintentional laughs<SEP>0
finally! an iranian film that is not made by majidi kiarostami or the makhmalbafs this is a non-documentary an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls subtly kicking the system in its ass its all about football and its funny its really funny the director says the places are real the event is real and so are the characters and the extras this is why i purposely chose not to use professional actors as their presence would have introduced a notion of falseness the non-actors will have you rooting for them straightaway unless a your heart is made of stone b you are blind excellently scripted the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness it has won the jury grand prize berlin 2006 dear reader its near-perfect where where can i get hold of it<SEP>1
so that´s what i called a bad bad film poor acting poor directing terrible writing!!!! i just can´t stop laughing at some scenes because the story is meaningless!!! don´t waste your time watching this film well i must recognize it has one or two good ideas but it´s sooooo badly writen<SEP>0
this movie was slower then molasses in january in alaska the man who put togeather the preview should get an award for managing to put every one of the 30 seconds that were interisting into the preview i had to wake up the people i was watching it with several times after it was over i felt bad for having woken them up most of the film is taken up with hoping something will actually happen but nothing ever does it was easy to loose track of peoples motives and the characters were flat and uninteristing by the end of the movie you just hoped everyone would died everyone runs around either being contemptible petty or pitiful and usually all three and worse we watched a minute or two of the added features just for kicks and giggles you understand and all that we saw was people being smug about how socially aware they are if they had spend the time on the movie that they did patting themselves on the back it might have been worth watching i was brought in expecting the excitement of 24 i got a lecture on social awareness through the blery eyes of the sandman<SEP>0
tony scott destroys anything that may have been interesting in richard kellys clichéd patchy overwrought screenplay domino harvey kiera knightley was a model who dropped out and became a bounty hunter this is her story sort ofthe problem with this rubbish is that there isnt much of a story at all and scotts extreme graphic stylization of every shot acts as a distancing mechanism that makes us indifferent to everything in harveys chaotic lifeyou just dont care about harvey knightley plays her as an obnoxious cynical brat who has done nothing to warrant our respect she punches people she doesnt like and sheds her clothes and inhibitions when the situation calls for it but she isnt the least bit real and knightly isnt the least bit convincing eitherthe film is boring its loud too and shackled with one of the most annoying source music scores ive heard in a long time the final twenty minutes are a poor re-run of scotts true romance climax with dominos gang going to meet two sets of feuding bad guys who are -- surprise! surprise! -- destined to shoot it out with each other at the top of a las vegas casinounfortunately this potentially exciting conflagration is totally botched by scott and becomes a confusing pretentious pointless exercise in celluloid masturbation this is not an artistically brave or experimental piece; it is a failure on every level because it gives us no entry point to the lives and dilemmas of its charactersmickey roarke looks good as a grizzled bounty hunter but he disappears into the background as the narrative progresses chris walken turns in another embarrassing cameo and dabney coleman always solid is underutilizeddont be fooled by this films multi-layered gimmick-ridden surface it is still a turd no matter how hard you polish it<SEP>0
following my experience of finland for slightly more than a week id say this movie depicts the nature of the finnish society very accurately especially the young-couple-with-a-baby-having-serious-issues phenomenon is very familiar to me as i witnessed the exact same thing in person when i was in finland the relationships and problems of people fragility of the marriage institution the drinking culture unemployment and the ascending money problem all are very well put without any subjectivity or exaggerationthere are some points in the film that are not necessarily easy to comprehend and tie to each other but the joint big picture is nonetheless rewarding not each one of the short stories is exciting or profound but as said above the big picture does not fail to deliver the feeling of real life and captivate the viewer i happen to think in a calm moment: what is happening in the lives of all these people on the street well this is what is happening movies like this are good to feed your imaginative power it would be safe to assume this film could apply to the life in many countries but it particularly reflects finland as it is and pretty damn wellone comment about the acting: being the fan of finnish cinema i am ive never seen any of these actors on any other movie but i found the acting in this feature right next door to perfect overall maybe not a masterpiece but a very good try by the entire crew ill be keeping an eye on the future releases of the director and the cast75 10<SEP>1
this early role for barbara shelleyin facther first in britain after working in italywas made when she was 24 years oldand its certainly safe to say that she made a stunning debut in 1957s cat girl while blondes and brunettes get most of the attentionill always cherish yutte stensgaardthe lovely auburn-haired actress with the deep voice always exuded intelligence as well as vulnerabilityone such example being 1960s village of the damned in which her screen time was much less than her characters husbandgeorge sandersshe is the sole reason for seeing this drab update of cat people and is seen to great advantage throughoutits difficult to say if her beauty found an even better showcaseher character apparently sleeps in the nudeand we are exposed to her luscious bare back when she is awakenedalso exposed 8 years later in 1965s rasputin-the mad monkthe ravishing gown she wears during most of the film is a stunning strapless wonderi dont see what held that dress upbut id sure like toall in allproof positive that barbara shelleyin a poorly written role that would defeat most actressesrises above her material and makes the film consistently watchablea real test of star powerwhich she would find soon enough at hammers studios in brayfor the duration of the 1960s<SEP>0
as i said in my comment about the first part: these two movies are better than most science fiction fans confessthe scenario in the second movie is not that moving as we dont see the destruction of human civilization but the aftermath thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans protected by only one powerful spaceshipbut when battlestar pegasus appears the story heats up carrying the battle back to the cylon planets okay it has a little bit of mad max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant earth but it works for me it is thrilling science fiction entertainment featuring fine actors and decent special effects even though those tend to repeat themselves to say the least :- i would have loved a continuation with starbuck and apollo on board instead we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so well-chosenso thumbs down for the productions of 1980 but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978<SEP>1
this is an old fashioned wonderfully fun childrens movie with surely the most appealing novice witch ever unlike many modern stories which seem to revel in dark witchcraft this is simply a magical tale of hocus pocus that is cute light hearted and charmingthe tale is set back in 1940 in the english village of peppering eye where three cockney children charlie carrie & paul rollins are being evacuated out of danger from world war ii city air raids they are mistakingly sent to live with eglantine price who is studying by correspondence course to become an apprentice witch eglantine and the trio of children use a magic bed knob in order to travel to london on their flying bed here they encounter emilius browne the fraudulent headmaster of miss prices witchcraft training correspondence school miss price sets about working on spells designed to bring inanimate objects to life meanwhile they must also deal with a shady character called the bookman and his associate swinburneangela lansbury is of course marvelously endearing as the eccentric witch in training miss price david tomlinson plays mr browne headmaster of the defunct witchcraft school who has now turned street magician this actor was previously cast as the childrens father in the movie mary poppins in fact this film is a tale quite reminiscent of the earlier mary poppins both wonderful fantasy stories for children perhaps this movie doesnt have quite such memorable music as chim-chim-cheree but it does boast some appealing little tunes some have been critical but the movie features excellent special effects all in all the story is enchanting family entertainment its a pity if modern children are too sophisticated for this lovely & bewitching tale which should appeal to the child in all of us<SEP>1
this is probably karisma at her best apart from zubeidaa nana patekar also gives out his best without even trying the story is very good at times but by the end seems to drag especially when shahrukh comes in the picture what really made me like it were the performances of the leads the dialog delivery as well as the story for what it was it couldve been directed better and edited the supporting case was even great including karimas mother in law even though she just had one shining moment it was great to watch herthe sets were also pretty good i didnt really like their portrayal of a canadian family but once they step in india its as real as it getsoverall i would give it a thumbs up!<SEP>1
this movie was absolutly awful i cant think of one thing good about it the plot holes were so huge you could drive a hummer through them the acting was soo stuningly bad that even jean claude should be ashamed and that is saying alot!!! and dialogue what dialogueto think that i was a fan of the first one i use that comment loosely its more like a guilty pleasure than anything else this movie had goldberg in it for crying out loud!!!! nothing good can come of this movie what makes this film even worse is that it is soo bad you cant even watch it with a bunch of friends to make fun of!!! this has got to be in my top five worst movies of all time 210 because it is soo hard for me to give a 1<SEP>0
i grew up watching and loving tng i just recently finished watching the entire series st voyager on dvd which may have heightened my sense of disgust with this episode as the difference in style and approach between the two shows couldnt be more stark the idea may have been good if used as an opportunity to further expand rikers character which is how it probably would have been treated on voy they could have featured memories that would be new to the audience rather than simply regurgitating old show clips the in and out transitions between the memories and the present in this episode start as cliché in the beginning and very quickly become intolerable as the tired pattern wears on and on bar none- worst episode ever<SEP>0
fear of a black hat is a hilarious spoof of hip-hop culture it is just as funny as this is spinal tap if not funnier the actors are incredible and the documentary style is superb mark christopher lawrence is a tremendous talent that should be starring in a lot more films this film is a true cult classic!<SEP>1

after erasing my thoughts nearly twenty-seven times there is a feeling that i can now conquer this review for the complex french drama read my lips having written over five hundred reviews i have never found myself at such a loss of words as i did with director jacques audiards subtle yet inspirational love story thought was poured over what was loved and hated about this film and while the loves overpowered it was the elements that were hated that sparked further debate within my mind read my lips is a drama to be more precise is a character driven drama which fuses social uncertainty with crime lords with the doldrums of everyday office work here is where this review begins to crumble it is all of these items  but it is more much much more as a viewer you are pulled in instantly by emmanuelle devos portrayal of this fragile woman named carla whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty audiard introduces us harshly to her world by removing sound from the screen whenever she is not wearing her aid causing an immediate unrest not only from the characters within the film but to those watching without sound the world is left open to any possibility and that is frighteningas we watch this difficult and unsettling woman setting into her life we are then uprooted and given the opportunity to meet paul played exquisitely by vincent cassel a slicked-back hair mustache-wearing lanky man who was just released from prison homeless jobless and forced by his parole officer to get a job this is how carla and paul meet there is that moment of instant unsettling attraction the one where we think she loves him but he is dark and here is where it gets even more fun  and where we think he loves her but she is dark the constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown who as viewers are we to feel the most sympathy for paul sleeps in the office carla helps him; carla looses a contract to a rival co-worker paul helps her; carlas ability to read peoples lips comes in handy for a make-shift idea for paul the continual jumps back and forth keep you on your chair waiting for the possibility of some light to shine through this dark cave it never does audiard cannot just allow this story to take place he continually introduces us to more characters; one just as seedy as the next even our rock our solid foundation with the parole officer is in question when his wife goes missing  a subplot to this film that at first angered me but upon further debate was a staple finale for this film yet none of this could have happened if it werent for our characters devos solemn and homely look is breathtaking as she changes her image for paul; the truth of her beauty is discovered paul the wildcard in the film continues to seemingly use and abuse the friendship for his final endgame then just as we assume one carla takes on one last shapeaudiard knows he has amazing actors capturing his characters cassel and devos could just play cards the entire time and i would still be sitting at the end of my chair the story probably the weakest part of this film is at first random the interwoven stories seem unconnected at first but audiard lets them connect bit by bit again the entire parole officer segment was tangent but that final scene just solidified the ends to the means not attempting to sound vague but this complex yet utterly simple story is difficult to explain there is plenty happening but it is up to you to connect the pieces a favorite scene is when carla is attempting to discover where some money is being held that use of sound and scene was brilliant it was tense it was dramatic and it was like watching a who-dun-it mystery unfold before your eyesoverall i initially though this was a mediocre french film that i could easily forget about when it was over  i was proved wrong read my lips opens the floor for discussion not just with the characters but the situations one will find themselves rooting for carla in one scene and paul in the next when a discovery is made in pauls apartment by carla i found myself deeply angry audiard brought true emotion to the screen with his characters and development and what he was lacking in plot  the actors were able to carry i can easily suggest this film to anyone but be prepared; this isnt a one time viewing film repeat repeat repeatgrade: **** out of *****<SEP>1
spoiler!! i love branagh love helena bonham-carter loved them together in mary shelleys frankenstein - but this -i can understand an actors desire to stretch to avoid the romantic stereotype well they did but really - the script droned on bonham-carters clothes were tres chic and the occasional speeded-up madcap sequence could have been an outtake from a beatles movie or the old rowan and martin laugh-ini never got the point - other commenters say the branagh character was a dreamer i never felt that he was a loser and not very bright and certainly not endearing the business with the bank robber disguise was merely painful to watch certainly not amusingbonham-carters realistic one supposes attempts as realistic speech were harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of lancashire accent in full montythe poetic ending with him high on a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his airplane was too orchestrated was there a choir of angels or merely a soundtrackgo back to the classics or something with a spine and an arc to it donate this to pbs<SEP>0
this was a fantastic episode i saw a clip from it on youtube and i vowed that should it ever show on tv i would glue myself to the set in order to watch i wound up watching it with a friend of mine who happens to be gay and the two of us cried at the end this was a truly well-written heartfelt episode of the forbidden love between two cops who i felt really were in coops words the lucky ones it is episodes like this one that really make cold case one of the most captivating and much-loved works of television magic on cbs i anxiously await more episodes and a re-run of forever blue because i will always watch it again and again<SEP>1
this was a very entertaining movie and i really enjoyed it i dont normally rent movies like these ie indie flicks however i was attracted to the film because it had an incredible cast which included jamie kennedy whom i have loved since the scream trilogy the movie director took a risk and it is a risky risk in telling the lives of many and i mean many different people and having the intertwine at various intervals taking that risk was a good idea because its end result is an exceedingly good film the film has a few main characters; dwight jamie kennedy - a disgruntled fortune cookie writer whose relationship with his girlfriend is on the rocks because of an argument wallace gregory john carroll lynch - an airplane loadertechnician who has a love for all living things except perhaps meter maids and who despite his good heart has an increasing amount of bad luck cyr brian cox - the owner of a chinese restaurantdonut shop who is a germaphobe and because of is his fear of germs places his assistantcook sung -alexis cruz under pressure to keep up with his phobia ernie - christopher bauer is married to olive - christina kirk who he is convinced is trying to; stop him have fun look ridiculous go insane and not live a normal life they begin to have petty and almost crazy arguments and olive seriously begins to have doubts about ernie gordon - grant heslov is a man whose life isnt going very well as bad things begin to add up in his life he decides to take it in hand mitchel - jon huertas is convinced that gwen - alexandra westcourt is the girl of his dreams and that they are destined for each other though she is more skeptical he attempts to woo her every chance he gets and he certainly makes attempts! johnston - michael hitchcock has just been fired from his job and has doubts about his role as provider he takes another job that he just isnt suited for his wife annelle - arabella field is comforting through out his job loss experience until she learns that johnston wasnt quite the loving husband she thought he wasall in all i definitely suggest this movie!-erica<SEP>1
i enjoy watching western films but this movie takes the biscuit the script and dialogue is laughable the acting was awful where did they get them from music was ok i have to say luckily i didnt buy or rent the movie but its now disposed ofi was geared up at the beginning when the stranger martin sheen started to tell his story i have to admit i did enjoy the confrontation between hopalong and tex where hopalong shot texs finger off and told him to practise for 40 years to reach his league but thats where it all went pear shaped thereafter i had to watch the whole film in the hope that it would get better never did<SEP>0
i saw this bomb when it hit theaters i laughed the whole time why because the stupidity of it seemed to have made me go insane i look back on it and realize there was not one funny thing in the whole movie at leat nothing intentional it is awfully funny that lizzie cn chew a piece of nurplex and become a gigantic carnivorous demonyet her itty-bitty little dress is perfectly intact despite the fact that she is now hundreds of times larger than she was when she first put it on or the kind of movie in which a man can be shocked with a defibulator and only fall unconcious and return to conciousness without any medical attention and dont let me get started on the ridiculous fate of the villain that they decided they needed to create conflict uh huhto the person complaining about disney only targetting kids-the raunchy parts of this film seems to disprove that statement do we really need daryl hannah accusing jeff bridges of having kinky video tapes you do if youre disney and youre out of ideas for making the movie appeal to the above-8 crowd without writing a more intelligent script! i am thoroughly convinced that disney pays off the ratings board so its movies can get away with murder and still get family-friendly ratingswhat a waste of the dvd format<SEP>0
every now and then a movie advertises itself as scary or frightening though they usually arent most modern horror movies fit into this categorythen there are those movies that dont simply cause the tension and adrenaline to pump through your veins harder than usual they actually frighten you to a level that youve never experiencedhalloween is such a film it takes so many risks that would make most movie producers cringe but nearly all of them work halloween is awe-inspiring in its simplicity and terrifying as a wholethe story is simple laurie strode jamie lee curtis is babysitting some kids on halloween night while a madman is on the loose after escaping from a mental institution after brutally murdering his older sister 15 years ago of course the madman later known as michael myers begins killing the local teenage population and eventually he comes after lauriesounds familiar right just another brainless slasher filled with dumb teenagers and gobs of gore not a chancei think james berardinelli puts it perfectly in his review of halloween: because of its title halloween has frequently been grouped together with all the other splatter films that populated theaters throughout the late-1970s and early-1980s however while halloween is rightfully considered the father of the modern slasher genre it is not a member he has a point and for a number of reasons first and foremost its downright terrifying whereas most entries into the teen slasher genre are dumb gore-fests one could argue that many recent ones are tongue-in-cheek but most of those fail as well second there is almost no violence very little of which is bloody john carpenter knows that violence does not equal scary and he relies very little on it actually the body count is pretty low in fact one can argue that this isnt really a horror movie at least not by todays standards of having the most deaths that can be crammed into a single movie each gorier and more sadistic than the last he relies on ideas for scares and also skill third while some of the characters may do stupid things that sometimes seal their fate they dont do them because theyre dumb the characters are real people so instead of thinking that the characters die because theyre idiots were frightened because theyre making a mistakeone of the main reasons why halloween is so scary is because it is so easy to believe that its real nothing is hard to swallow in this film theres no supernatural theres no ridiculously creative plot elements or inventive murders or whatnot instead all the set pieces and camera work save the opening sequence are simple carpenter just sets the camera in place and says action what we get is the feeling that were actually seeing a murder take place right in front of ushorror movies are probably the most difficult films to make because in order for something to be scary everything has to be perfect and ideas never work twice its a hit or miss game which is why if i were to tell you all the good ideas that carpenter has which im not theyd seem primitive particularly since they have been repeated with lesser effect over and over again through the yearsacting here is not a plus point because it doesnt need to be this is a movie about scary ideas not a movie about dramatic conflicted characters the actors act like real people not characters from a story nothing more the exception to this is whoever plays the shape or later known as michael myers it can be scary to have a person say nothing and simply kill but its hard to pull off and even harder to keep people from asking why but the guy pulls it off and the result is terrifyingthis is carpenters movie through and through he directed it co-wrote it co-produced it and wrote the chilling score of it this is a man of brilliance and his later movie the thing supports this statement though the thing is not as scary as halloween unfortunately his success has dramatically diminished as it happens when the lure of big money for less freedom is taken advantage of once big time producers recognize your potential as good as this film is its not without flaws the famous opening scene is disturbing but not very scary and not many of the scares work for the first part of the movie its not that its bad its just that theres no good reason to fear the shape luckily carpenter mostly uses this time to set up a relationship between the characters and the audience while theres no intimacy in this relationship it fits the purpose we grow to know the characters but not so much that its disheartening when they die but once the film gets to halloween night thats when carpenter kicks things into high gear and it never stops until you get to the endwhile halloween may be flawed it is only slightly so it is an immensely terrifying film and a must see for anyone who loves scary movies be warned though this movie will scare the living hell out of you!<SEP>1
this movie is a very relaxed romantic-comedy which is thoroughly enjoyable meg ryan does a very good job as the genius niece of albert einstein though she does believe in her own skills tim robbins does an equally good job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she comes into his shop with her fiancé after her car stuffs up i loved walter matthau as the one and only albert einstein this movie just has a very relaxing feel to it while still keeping some sort of seriousness to it if that is actually possible it happens herei personally found this movie extremely entertaining especially the old scientists - i thought they were fab and hilarious! this movie seems to have been underestimated beyond comprehension if you have a cheeky sense of humour this is the movie for you!<SEP>1
a great opportunity for and indy director to make an interesting film about a rock musician on the brink of stardom it could have been a decent film if it would have dealt with john liviens traumatic past and how it is torturing his psyche instead it is a ridiculous attempt to identify john liviens life with john lennons john liviens suicida mothers hero was john lennon and she wished for him to become as powerful and prolific as lennon himself instead of focusing on john lennons musical brilliance and his wonderful ability to bare himself for others to learn something about their own life it showed lennons legacy to be that of a confused drug addicted soul who should looked upon as a god instead a man i am a huge john lennon fan and this movie reminded me of another crazy person obsessed with lennon lennons killer mark david chapman lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with lennon do we need to be reminded of that john lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty and i was repulsed to see another disturbed person as the main character in this movie obsessed by lennon and not show his beautiful contributions to the world yoko ono graciously honored john lennons memoryby making the memorial in central park to give his fans a chance to pay their respects and remember john instead the director of this movie chose to use that site to have the killer attempt to commit suicide i found this so disturbing and disrespectful to lennons memory he was a man of peace who died a brutal senseless death and to see such violence near this site felt like a revisiting a terrible wound for any lennon fan it ruined the movie completely for me it could have been a decent movie but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth let john lennon and his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his vicious murder by this irresponsible movie<SEP>0
this 1919 to 1933 germany looks hardly like a post wwii czech capitol oh sorry it is the czech capitol and it is 2003 how funnythis is one of the most awful history movies in the nearest past röhm is a head higher than adolf and looks so damned good göring looks like 40 when he just is 23 and the führer always seems to look like 56 and the buildings folks even buildings have been young sometimes especially 1919 were a lot of houses in germany nearly new the wwi does not reach german cities! no crumbling plaster! then the reichstagsbuilding there have never been urban canyons around this building never and this may sound to you all like a miracle: in the year 1933 the greater berlin fire brigade owns a lot of vehicles with engines some even with turntable ladders but none with a hand pumpone last thing: what kind of playmobil castle was this at the final sequence for me this was a kind of adolfs adventures in wonderland<SEP>0

first of all excuse my bad english of course only a movie starring jessica simpson can include serious goofs like this im a norwegian and i felt offended and shocked the makers of this movie did not take the time to do their research upon making this americannorwegian movie even wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this countryso im posting my corrections out of my frustration: -the country is named norway not norwegia -da is russian not norwegian -norwegian priests never use those black capes with that white paper by the neck as the protestant church is the dominant by far -its true we have a native traditional folk-outfit that we only use like twice a year but the outfit in this movie is more like a german outfit -i could not understand the so called norwegian in this movie jessica was not making any sense neighter did the norwegian prieststhe only thing i recognise is the norwegian flag and the viking hats but thats so stereotypic what people think about norway - vikings!:o goshwell i guess the people who made this film will never read this comment but at least i cleared some things up and got rid of some of that frustration!im proud of my country and id love if people in the us were less stereotypic and more accurate when they talk about this countrythat was all lenge leve norge ! ;p<SEP>0
i saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show i still vividly remember the film especially the performance of robert taylor i always thought taylor was underrated as an actor as most critics saw him as solid almost dull leading man type and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks this film however proved what an interesting actor he could be he did not get enough roles like this during his long career this is his best performance he is totally believable in a truly villainous role from what i have read he was a very hardworking and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for these kind of roles he basically would just do what mgm gave him this film proves that he could have handled more diverse and difficult roles the other thing i remember about this film is how annoying lloyd nolans character was nolan was a great actor but this character really aggravated me the last scene of the film has stuck with me for all of these years this film is definitely worth a look<SEP>1
i happened to spot this flick on the shelf under new releases and found the idea of a hip-hop zombie flick far too interesting to pass up thats how it was billed on the box anyhow and i thought to myself what a great idea! plus theres a welcome to oakland sign on the cover too how could i resist unfortunately the hip-hop part only lasted for as long as the opening theme neither hip-hop music nor hip-hop culture had much of a role in the movie having lived in oakland myself i know that there are many aspiring hip-hop artists there so the low budget of this flick was no excuse not to have a fitting soundtrack any number of struggling artists would have jumped on the opportunity to contribute to this flick why the quiroz brothers didnt take advantage of this is beyond meonce the film got rolling it was a completely typical zombie movie with a cast that just so happened to be completely black and latino you might think that this would put an unusual slant on the movie but it didnt somehow the quiroz brothers vision of urban culture boils down to drive-by shootings and dropping an f-bomb in every line in the movie the rapid-fire use of the word fuck is probably this movies most distinguishing characteristics; there were single lines that contained the word three or four times and no line didnt contain it at least once im not at all squeamish about swearing in a movie but the feeling here was that it was the result of a lack of ideas on the part of the writers also the quiroz brothers and the script was generally very poorthe film was generally a disappointment it would have been interesting to see a genuinely urban culture zombie flick but hood of the living dead doesnt deliver on that count the characters in the movie could just as easily have been white or eskimo or anything else there was no distinct flavor to the movie its just another run-of-the-mill low budget flick with bad acting lousy writing amateurish direction bland cinematography a cheap soundtrack and nothing at all to recommend it<SEP>0
st elmos fire has no bearing on life after university at all for the majority of us common folk anyway why was this garbage even made who can really relate to this who lives like these characters i truly feel sorry for the actors having to deal with such a terrible script there are some talented young actors in this film that have done a good job elsewhere it must have just been one whole joke to them on seti actually found this film insulting to my intelligence the only joy i got from this is hoping that sir john hughes had a good ol laugh when he saw a screening of this the same year his masterpiece of the breakfast club was releaseddont make the same mistake i did of watching this because you enjoy 80s films it really is that offensive to the genre<SEP>0
this show proved to be a waste of 30 minutes of precious dvr hard drive space i didnt expect much and i actually received less not only do i expect this show to be canceled by the second episode i cannot believe that geico will ever attempt to use the cavemen ad campaign ever again i would have preferred spending a night checking my daughters hair for head lice than watching this piece of refuse i wonder what abc passed on to make this show fit into the 07 fall schedual perhaps a hospitalcrimemocumentary reality show featuring the aflac duck in the event that i failed to express my opinion about this show let me be clear and say that it is not too good<SEP>0
this is the worst movie i have ever seen i was going to get up and leave at tape 4 but i stuck it out i now consider myself a masochist! afghanistan come on guys! whos the idiot who forgot to hide the sanskrit billboards i thought the lead actorgeorge calil was particularly inept apart from the bad acting and over zealous camera shake i thought using the events of 911 as a reason to make larson the lunatic implodes all over a screen near you disgraceful and irreverent to the victims of 911 using a phone call from larsons wife sarah supposedly from one of the terrorist held planes on that day was appalling the camera shake didnt make me feel sick that cold hearted stunt did<SEP>0
this is one great movie! i have played all the nancy drew games and have read the books and i never expected the movie to be so exciting and funny! if you never heard of nancy drew read the first book secret of the old clock so you can kinda get used to nancy then you can watch the movie because in the movie they dont really introduce the characters names fast ; my whole family enjoyed it and the plot was extremely interesting this is an ultimate come-back from the previous nancy drew movies which the nancy drew actor didnt seem to match this movie is much like alex rider: stormbreaker its so cool! nancy drew lovers you must watch this!<SEP>1
live! yes but not kickingtrue story: some time ago a dutch tv station made an announcement that they were going to air a new reality show a contest rather the main participant in this show would be a woman who was dying of something terrible and she would be donating her kidneys to one lucky person with progressive kidney failure for realthe country and the international media were all over this story like flies on a turd saying it was appalling immoral what-is-this-world-coming-to and the like in a way i had to agreeas the months passed the tension built up to a degree that the government was mostly occupied by the issue of whether they should let this show go ahead or not instead of running the countrythe show did air and right up to the last moment they were pushing ahead and up to the last moment the country was up in arms the prime minister making speeches every newspaper writing about it everyone in the country holding their breaths and the network pushed on towards a new frontier in television and they definitely succeeded in doing just that they pushed the envelopethe show aired and we all watched a terminally ill woman selecting the right candidate to receive her kidneys so he or she would live whilst she would die shortly afterand then in the last moments of the show it was revealed that it was a partial hoax the woman was not ill but all the candidates were there was no kidney auction the whole show that with the publicity and the commercials and all the discussions built up for months to a fantastic climax was a publicity stunt to focus attention on the problem of major shortages in organ donors the man who founded this particular network himself died of kidney diseasenow this is television leaving everybody far behind in amazementdont give me a poorly acted poorly directed flick about some woman trying to get a russian roulette show on american tvas if*spoiler* as if im going to believe they would get this through the fcc as if im going to believe this would get through the us supreme court on the basis of free expression as if im gonna believe the ridiculous ending where this woman pulled it off and has conscience issues because some guy shot himself on airits all been done before watch running man with arnold instead at least it had a semi good ending*spoiler* this is an appallingly bad piece of film together with a ridiculous ending so she gets shot in the end is that supposed to make us movie going public feel better after we leave the theater because there was some kind of justice dont take my word for it but i would say this: leave this one alone and watch a test pattern instead youll get more quality<SEP>0
a cheap exploitation film about a mothers search for her daughter who has been kidnapped by people who make snuff porno films the trail leads the mother all over europe as she searches for her child and we in the audience struggle to stay asleepthis is one of the countless soft-core sleaze films that are made for people who want the excitement of porno with out the stigma or danger of it showing up on their credit card billpersonally id rather have the stigma since those films tend to be more interesting and honest about what were seeing this is suppose to be a sexy thriller but its not mostly its people talking about things followed by lots of walking from place to place and lead to leadperiodically through out the film various people get undressed and everything has more than a touch of s&m to the proceedings the violence and fetish material is of the sort to provoke laughter rather than horror or even excitement its all so incredibly fake worse there is not even enough nudity to keep it interesting basically par for the course for many of these filmsyoull forgive my lack of details but it simply is a dull boring film that i stayed with to the end hoping for something remotely prurient to occur but there was nothing the most interesting thing was the blonde haired villainess with the huge over bite and nose the size of a buick i watched her with morbid fascination wondering what she had looked like as a young girl and wondering whether she had had plastic surgery not the type of things you should be thinking about in a gripping thrilleravoid<SEP>0

my kid makes better videos than this! i feel ripped off of the $400 spent renting this thing! there is no date on the video case apparently designed by wellspring; and whats even worse theres no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie! the only date given is 2002 leading an unsuspecting renter to believe hes getting a recent filmthis movie was so bad from a standpoint of being outdated and irrelevant for any time period but precisely when it was made that im amazed that anyone would take the time and expense to market it as a video it might be of interest to students studying the counter-culture of the 1960s the anti-war anti-establishment tune-in turn-on and drop out culture; but when you read the back of the video case theres no hint that that is what youre getting if you do make the mistake of renting it though it is probably best viewed while on drugs so that your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the minds of the directors fassbinder and fengler regardless of your state of mind while watching it i can tell you that it doesnt get any better after the first scene; so knowing that im sure youll be fast asleep long before the end<SEP>0
jeux denfants or how the film was wrongly translated into english love me if you dare is a film made by stupid people and about stupid people i just dont know how i could expect something worth a look from a film with such plot: two stupid ignorant kids make a bet that each of them will do something certainly extremely idiotic to prove to each other wtf that they are cool dudes i know that i exaggerated some aspects but that is what the entire film is about they grow olderand instead of realizing that they are just a couple of alienated weirdos continue to perform their crazy things thinking that they are great peopleone could expect such a film from hollywood but france it is even more offensive to watch the film from the country which created amelie a couple of years ago which btw the film tries to look like but is far extremely far away fromavoid avoid avoid<SEP>0
my former cambridge contemporary simon heffer today a writer and journalist has put forward the theory that just as british film-makers in the eighties were often critical of what they called thatchers britain the ealing comedies were intended as satires on attlees britain the britain which had come into being after the labour victory in the 1945 general election this theory was presumably not intended to apply to say kind hearts and coronets which is if anything a satire on the edwardian upper classes or to the ladykillers or the lavender hill mob both of which may contain some satire but are not political in nature it can however be applied to most of the other films in the series especially passport to pimlicopimlico is or at least was in the forties a predominantly working-class district of london set on the north bank of the thames about a mile from victoria station it is not quite correct to say as has often been said that the film is about pimlico declaring itself independent of britain what happens is that an ancient charter comes to light proving that in the fifteenth century the area was ceded by king edward iv to the duchy of burgundy this means that technically pimlico is an independent state and has been for nearly five hundred years irrespective of the wishes of its inhabitants the government promise to pass a special act of parliament to rectify the anomaly but until the act receives the royal assent the area remains outside the united kingdom and british laws do not applybecause pimlico is not subject to british law the landlord of the local pub is free to open whatever hours he chooses and local shopkeepers can sell whatever they please to whomever they please unhindered by the rationing laws when other traders start moving into the area to sell their goods in the streets the british authorities are horrified by what they regard as legalised black-marketeering and seal off the area to try and force the burgundians as the people of pimlico have renamed themselves to surrendermany of the ealing comedies have as their central theme the idea of the little man taking on the system either as an individual as happens in the man in the white suit or the lavender hill mob or as part of a larger community as happens in whisky galore or the titfield thunderbolt the central theme of passport is that of ordinary men and women taking on bureaucracy and government-imposed regulations which seemed to be an increasingly important feature of life in the britain of the forties the films particular target is the rationing system during the war the system had been accepted by most people as a necessary sacrifice in the fight against nazism but it became increasingly politically controversial when the government tried to retain it in peacetime it was a major factor in the growing unpopularity of the attlee administration which had been elected with a large majority in 1945 and organisations such as the british housewives league were set up to campaign for the abolition of rationing i cannot agree with the reviewer who stated that the main targets of the films satire were the spivs black marketeers who play a relatively minor part in the action or the housewives league who do not appear at all the satire is very much targeted at the bureaucrats who are portrayed either as having a rules for rules sake mentality or a desire to pass the buck and avoid having to take any action at alli suspect that if the film were to be made today it would have a different ending with pimlico remaining independent as a british version of monaco or san marino indeed i suspect that today this concept would probably serve as the basis of a tv sitcom rather than a film in 1949 however four years after the end of the war the film-makers were keen stress patriotism and british identity so the film ends with pimlico being reabsorbed into britain one of the best-known lines from the film is we always were english and we always will be english and its just because we are english that were sticking up for our right to be burgundians there is a sharp contrast between the rather heartless attitude of officialdom with the common sense tolerance and good humour of the cockneys of pimlico all of which are presented as being quintessentially british characteristicsmost of the action takes place during a summer drought and sweltering heatwave but in the last scene after pimlico has rejoined the uk the temperature drops and it starts to pour with rain global warming may have altered things slightly but for many years part of being british was the ability to hold the belief whatever statistics might say to the contrary that britain had an abnormally wet climate the ability to make jokes about that climate was equally importantthere is a good performance from stanley holloway as arthur pemberton the grocer and small-time local politician who becomes the prime minister of free pimlico and an amusing cameo from margaret rutherford as a batty history professor in the main however this is appropriately enough for a film about a small community pulling together an example of ensemble acting with no real star performances but with everyone making a contribution to an excellent film it lacks the ill-will and rancour of many more recent satirical films but its wit and satire are no less effective for all that it remains one of the funniest satires on bureaucracy ever made and with the possible exception of kind hearts and coronets is my personal favourite among the ealing comedies 1010<SEP>1
the notorious bettie page is about a woman who always wanted to be an actress but instead became one of the most famous pin up girls in the history of america bettie page played by gretchen mol was one of the first sex icons in america the type of modeling bettie page took part in included nudity and bondage which lead to a us senate investigation in the 1950swalking out of the film all i could think about was how far we have come in terms of pornography since the 1950s you can go on the internet now and find some of most disturbing and shocking images ever shot that the footage questioned in the notorious bettie page seems almost childlike and innocent most of the footage including the bondage did not feature nudity when bettie page was involved yet today we have sick images where we can see women having sex with animals i find that maybe the envelope has been pushed a little too far since the 1950s because looking at this movie in terms of todays pornography it was very tastefully doneto be honest i was pretty impressed with the notorious bettie page i found the film to be very well done and interesting the movie is exactly what the trailer leads you to believe it will be and is a very interesting look at one of the first female sex icons in america gretchen mol looks just like bettie page and gives a very fine performance i also thought that since the movie was shot in black and white it made the film seem realistic because it made the audience believe they were watching a film created in the late 1950smy only complaint about the film was the running time there seemed to be a few scenes that were cut and seemed to be a little shorter than they should have been i looked this up and it seems that 10 minutes was cut from the film since its original showing at the toronto film festival also the ending was pretty tame and i was expecting a little more from it or maybe some paragraphs to come on the screen to tell the audience more about bettie pages life where the film left off those are my only two complaints about the film other than that the directing was solid the acting was great especially gretchen and the writing was goodmary harron who directed american psycho which is one of my favorite films is the director and writer of the notorious bettie page i feel that mary is a very talented director who knows how to create a setting and create great movies based on characters because like psycho bettie page is a character study and a fine one at that harron captures the 40s and 50s with ease as well as all the characters she is a very talented director who i hope will be around for many years to comebottom line: the notorious bettie page is definitely worth a look its a very interesting story that shows how far america as well as the world has come in terms of pornography the film also provides a fine performance by gretchen mol who literally nails the role of bettie page on the head and top it off with a talented director who was able to capture the look and feel of a previous era and you have a good movie on your hands sadly this film is probably going to flop since not many besides people who grew up in this era will show interest in the film but i think its worth checking outmoviemanmenzels final rating for the notorious bettie page is a 810 its an interesting character study about one of the most famous pin up girls and sex icons in american history<SEP>1
i watched this movie alongwith my complete family of nine since my younger brother has recently got married we could connect with the goings-on the movie stands out for the classical touch given to the romance of the engaged couple thankfully this time all indian locales like ranikhet almora etc have been used which have been already visited by most of the urbanites hence adding to the connection with movie the dialogues are much better than those in the umrao jaan ada - a supposedly dialogue based movie the background music is augmenting the soft focus of the movie it somehow remind me of vv chopras kareeb in which neha and to some extent bobby did full justice to the character same here in that the lead pair does not disappoint in any department-looks or acting the supporting cast are too good i rate the actress playing the role of bhabhi in the front league the situations of family interactions portrayed are real and you smile when you find yourself in place of one of the characters songs were too suiting the scenes and going along well with the movie however though i respect ravindra jain for his body of work from movies to ramayana i missed ram laxman badlyit had no double entendressivan category no bikinis no intrigue and no nonsense you would comfortably watch the movie with your parents except if youre already or going to be soon engaged i want to express on candid thing here that though suraj proposes that the marriages is between families and not only individuals his approach is totally individualistic the movie is only about prem & poonam rest of the characters are incidental art immitating life the peripheral characters are consigned to the background and the only protagonists are the lead pair coming back everything was almost great except for the drama part the situation of tragedy was artificially created the outcome the sacrifice and the ensuing heart change are not compelling at all that is why it lacks the emotional punch-the very purpose of this turn of events but a twist in the tale was necessary to transcend the movie from a beautiful pre-marital video to a feature film but i kept waiting for the punch and it never came the preaching by mohnish bahal and later by alok nath on dowry was out of place and it made things too overboard may be this will help the movie a tax-free status but the plot could have been made more interesting and non-linear than what it wasthere were too question in my mind when the movie ended: 1 has the movie really ended 2 has the movie ended<SEP>1
it begins on a nice note only to falter quickly and let down expectationsmac akshay kumar and sams john abraham characters are not properly built before macs boss decides to hitch him with three air hostess rest of the drama is about how mac sam and uncle mambo paresh rawal deal with situations which at times seem forcedabout the cast paresh rawal is a very talented actor i thought was wasted in the role of a moody cook akshay kumar is tolerable john abraham is very bad keeps stumbling over furniture & rajpal yadav is the only saving grace in the movie the second half of the movie is funny at times but in all a dud songs are boring and a major let down if you are hoping for some wholesome entertainment and comedy<SEP>0
this film is deeply disappointing not only that wenders only displays a very limited musical spectrum of blues it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely boring the only highlight of the movie is the interview of a swedish couple who were befriended with jb lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories wenderss introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly - alluding to worlds culture or actually american culture traveling in space but his limited looks on the theme as well as the neither funny nor utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s renders this movie as a mere sleeping aid yawn i had expected more of him<SEP>0
i think this couldve been a decent movie and some of its parts are ok but in whole its a b movie same about the plot parts are ok but it has several holes and oddities that doesnt quite add up acting is mostly ok ive seen worse of this too :the beginning sets the level with cars driving in the desert making cool but totally unnecessary jumps through some small dunes in slow motion! cool! like the drivers had never seen sand before it gets slightly better from there but not muchif youre gonna rent this get another one too and use this one as a warm-up keep expectations low and it might work for you<SEP>0
this movie wasnt awful but it wasnt very good i am a big fan toni collette i think she is a very beautiful and talented actress the movie starts off about robin williams who is a writer and gets a book from a 14 year old kid the book is great and he cantt believe a kid wrote it toni collette plays the kids guardian who you dont know if this kid really exists or if shes making it all up i am not gonna ruin the movie but i will say this the movie is not scarythe acting is pretty good and toni collettes performance was awesome as well as robin williams the movie was a huge disappointment in my opinion i would wait for it to come to dvd<SEP>0
was there a single positive to this film critics who knew nothing of video games could spot the gaming errors made no damage taken with damage clearly visible towards the beginning being a primary exampleand i may have missed something but wasnt super mario bros 3 suppose to be a game that had never played before well if that is the case and i did not miss anything how did fred savages character and even the girl know so much about the game already were talking things that some people dont know about by their second or third play-throughbeyond the factual and gaming errors there is the general low quality of the film itself nothing here is honestly very memorable the kid wasnt even that good at playing video games in the footage they showed a lot of kids i knew way back in those days were significantly more experienced on top of all this the acting and storyline are just mediocre at their strongest points the characters are bland and completely uninteresting the wizard the youngest child is a very silent completely dry child cliché of a little kid who almost never talks because of a trauma it isnt that this is unrealistic its the fact that it had to be thrown into the movie to actually even begin to form a plot that would exceed even 30 minuteshonestly the only value that is to be found here is that of a nostalgic nature if you grew up with this movie youre going to like it whether it was good or not it was about kids playing video games and at the time you saw it you likely had an obsession with the nes as well but unless you loved it as a kid there just isnt anything thats going to keep you interested and very little that will prevent you from turning it offno sir i didnt like it<SEP>0
lets cut a long story short i loved every minute of it a lavish fantasy in true arabian-nights style theres an evil magician a pretty princess a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after modern hollywoond sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic only quibble: the special effects are pretty dated loved sabu with the djinns foot though!<SEP>1

i last night i had the pleasure of seeing the movie bug at the florida film festival and let me say it was a real treat the directors were there and they did a q&a afterwards the movie begins with a young boy smashing a roach beneath his foot a man who is nearby parking his car sees the young boy smash it and runs to ask the kid `why why did he have to kill that living creature in his rush to counsel the youth in the error of his ways the man neglects to pay his parking meter which starts off a whole chain of events involving people not at all related to him some funny some sad and some ridiculous this movie has a lot of laughs lots! and there are many actors which you will recognize the main actors who stood out in the film for me were: jamie kennedy from his comedy show the jamie kennedy experiment playing a fortune cookie writer; john carroll lynch who plays drews cross dressing brother on the drew carey show playing the animal loving guy who just cant get it right; brian cox the original hannibal lecter in manhunter playing the germaphobic owner of a donut and chinese food take out joint there is one line where cox tells his chef to wash off some pigs blood that is on the sidewalk by saying clean up that death which is quite funny mostly because of coxs obsessed with germs delivery the funniest moment in the movie comes when a young boy imitates his father whom he heard earlier in the day yell out `motherf***** while in the classroom another extremely funny and surreal scene is when trudie styler mrs sting herself and another actor perform a scene on a cable access show from the film the boy in the plastic bubble the actor who hosts the cable access show is just amazing he is so serious and deadpan and his performance as both the doctor and the boy in the plastic bubble is enthralling there are many other fine and funny actors and actresses in this film and having shot it in less than a month with a budget of just about $1 million the directors phil hay and matt manfredi who are screenwriters by trade having written crazybeautiful and the upcoming tuxedo starring jackie chan have achieved a film that is great funny and endearing<SEP>1
bacall does well here - especially considering this is only her 2nd film this one is often overshadowed because it falls between 2 great successes: to have and to have not 1944 and the big sleep 1945 both of which paired her with humphrey bogart granted this one is not up to par to the other movies but i think through no fault of her own i think there was some miscasting in having her portray a british upper-crust lady no accent whatsoever i think all the strange accents were distracting - boyer was certainly no spaniard it was hard to keep straight which country people were fromi really liked the black and white cinematography mood is used to great affect - i especially liked the fog scene the lighting also does a great job of adding to the intrigue and tensionbacall is just gorgeous boyer just doesnt fit the romantic leading man role for me - so he and bacall together was a little strange not great chemistry - and certainly no bogie and bacall magic but i still really liked this picture there is great tension and it moves along well enough i must say i found the murder of the little girl quite bold for this period filmkatina paxinou and peter lorre stand out as supporting cast paxinou as the hotel keeper is absolutely villainous and evil in her portrayal her one scene where she laughs maniacally as mr muckerji is leaving after exposing her as the childs murderer is quite disturbing lorre also does quite well in his slimy snake portrayal of conteras - a sleazy coward to the end wanda bendrix also does quite well in portraying the child else - especially considering this was her first picture and she was only 16 at the time though she appears much younger turns out she later married auie murphy which proved to be a short lived tempestuous marriage<SEP>1
the point of the vastly extended preparatory phase of this star is born story seems to be to make ultimate success all the more sublime summer phoenix is very effective as an inarticulate young woman imprisoned within herself but never convincing as the stage actress of growing fame who both overcomes and profits from this detachment even in the lengthy scenes of esthers acting lessons we never see her carry out the teachers instructions after suffering through esthers largely self-inflicted pain in excruciating detail we are given no persuasive sense of her triumphthe obsessive presence of the heroines pain seems to be meant as a guarantee of aesthetic transcendence yet the causes of this pain poverty quasi-autism judaism sexual betrayal never come together in a coherent whole a 163-minute film with a simple plot should be able to knit up its loose ends esther kahn is still not ready to go before an audience<SEP>0
in iran women are not admitted to soccer games officially its because they are to be spared from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience but of course it is about sexism women are lower forms of human beingssome brave girls oppose this and try to get into the stadium by using different tricks they are caught by soldiers and hold in a kind of cage until the police will come and pick them updespite the insane situation this is a film with lots of humor its also encouraging to see how people always find different ways of fighting oppression youll get touched at the same time as you have lots of laughs good job by director jafar panahi this is in many ways a heroic comedy<SEP>1
i dont believe there has ever been a more evil or wicked television program to air in the united states as the 700 club they are todays equivalent to the ku klux klan of the 20th century their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of americans as well as billions of humans the world over who dont happen to share their bigoted cruel monstrous and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen the lies they spout and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth such as the idea of life after death or god or sin or the devil is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill so lost are they in their fantasy sane people know that religion is a drug and shouldnt let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy however the 700 club is in a class by itself they are truly a cult while i believe in freedom of speech they way they spread hatred lies disinformation and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits i hope that one day the american psychiatric association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion the 700 club though is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of cult but due to the 700 clubs vast wealth conned daily from the millions of americans locked in their deceitful grip they are above the law in this country for those of you who have seen the movie the matrix you know that movie was a metaphor for religion on earth: the evil ones who are at the top of each of the religions who drain the ones they have trapped and cruelly abuse for their own selfish purposes and those millions who are held in a death sleep and slowly being drained of their life force represent those many people who belong to religions and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around themin less civil times the good townsfolk would have run such monsters as those associated with the 700 club out of town with torches and pitchforks but in todays world where people have lost all choice in their choices of television that is presented to them we have no way to rid ourselves of the 700 club plague the television ratings system and the v chip on tvs should also have a rating called r for religion so that rational people and concerned parents could easily screen such vile intellectual and brutal emotional rape such as presented by the 700 club every day all over our country from themselves and their children<SEP>0
the movie is basically the story of a russian prostitutes return to her home village for the funeral of a sisterfriend there are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken but they are not fully explored the core of the movie is the funeral wake and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable apparently the movie is unedited the prostitutes journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud maybe thats supposed to impress us with the immensity of the russian landscape the village itself such as it is is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male the consort of the dead girl continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible most of the film is shot with a hand-held camera that could induce nausea another problem for western viewers is that subtitles dont include the songs and laments of the crones dont go to this movie unless youre fluent in russian<SEP>0
this british film is truly awful and its hard to believe that glenn ford is in it although he pretty much sleepwalks through it the idea of a bomb on a train sounds goodbut it turns out this train ends up parked for the majority of the film! no action no movement just a static train the area where the train is parked is evacuated so its not like theres any danger to anyone either in fact this film could be used in a film class to show how not to make a suspense film true suspense is generated by letting the audience know things that the characters dont a fact apparently unknown to the director spoiler: the train actually has two bombs on it but we are led to believe there is only one after the first bomb is defused it feels as if there is no longer a reason to watch the film any more but at the last minute the villain who has no apparent motivation for his actions reveals there are two nor are we certain when the bombs will go off so we dont even have a classic ticking bomb tension sequence a good 10 minutes or more are spent watching glenn fords french wife thinking about leaving him and then wondering where he is shes such an annoying character that we dont care whether she reconciles with him so when she does theres nothing emotional about it most of the other characters are fairly devoid of personality and none have any problems or issues its only 72 minutes but it feels long because its tedious and dull dont waste your time<SEP>0
i had read many good things about this adaptation of my favorite novelso invariably my expectations were crushed but they were crushed more than should be expected the movie would have been a decent movie if i had not read the novel beforehand which perhaps ruined it for mein any event for some reason they changed the labor camp at toulon to a ship full of galley slaves the scene at bishop myriels was fine in fact other than the galleys things survived up until the dismissal of fantine because we do not want to have bad things happen to a good woman she does not cut her hair sell her teeth or become a prostitute the worst she does is run into the mayors office and spit on his face bamatabois is entirely eliminated because having children out of wedlock should also not be talked about tholomyes is fantines dead husband rather than an irresponsible dandy valjean is able to fetch cosette for fantine before the champmathieu affair so they reunite happily yet another change then comes the convent which is a pretty difficult scene to screw up thankfully it was saved after this three minutes of accuracy however the movie again begins to hurtle towards classic novel butcheringas cosette and valjean are riding through the park they come across marius giving a speech at a meeting about prison reform when he comes to hand out fliers to valjean and cosette he says the one line in the movie that set me screaming at the tv set we arent revolutionaries i could hear victor hugo thrashing in his grave of course they are revolutionaries! they want to revolt against the pseudo-monarchy that is in place in favor of another republic you dumb screenwriters! its a historical fact that there was an insurrection against the government in 1832 at one point cosette goes to give marius a donation from her father for the reform movement and meets eponine exceptnot eponine or at least not the eponine of the book this eponine appears to be a well-to-do secretary girl working for the prison reformers who are working out of the cafe universal as opposed to the cafe musain not to mention the audience is already made to dislike her thanks to her not-period low-cut tight-fitting dress and her snooty mannerismsthe prison reformers lead by the most poorly cast enjolras that i have ever seen decide that handing out pamphlets isnt good enough anymore so theyre going to build barricades i dont know about you but i have never heard of reform movements tearing up the streets and building barricades and attacking government troops about three hundred people it was not supposed to be so many start attacking the national guard and building a bunch of barricades etc eponine does die for marius thankfully the rest of the movie is sort of accurate except that javerts suicide again seems hard to understand thanks to his minuscule screen time and odd character interpretation the movie ends with valjean watching javert jump into the river this is again inaccurate because valjean would never have let javert drown he saved the mans life earlier why let him die now then theres the whole skipping of valjeans confession to marius his deterioration and his redemption on his deathbed with marius and cosette by his sideoverall i can blame the script mostly for the problems while i am glad enjolras and eponine were at least present in the film they were terribly misinterpreted as was the entire barricade scene the elimination of fantines suffering prevents us from feeling too much pity for her that cosette knows valjeans past from the start messes with the plot a good deal i did not even see thenardier and mme thenardier only had a few seconds of screen time the same with gavroche i did like frederich marchs interpretation of valjean a lot however which was one of the redeeming features of the movie on the other hand charles laughton for all his great acting in other movies seems to have missed the mark with javert the lip tremble the unnecessary shouting and his acting in general all just felt very wrong he also like many javerts i have seen did not appear at all menacing something required of the characteragain this film would probably feel much better if i had not read the book i would not recommend it to book purists though i would also say that the movie would have been a good adaptation for the time had not the infamously accurate french version come out the year before<SEP>0
i reached the end of this and i was almost shouting no no no no! it cannot end here! there are too many unanswered questions! the engagement of the dishwashers monas disappearance helmers comeuppance the zombie was little brother saved by his father and what about the head argh!! then i read that at least two of the cast members had passed on and i have to say i know it probably wouldnt be true to lars von triers vision but i would gladly look past replacement actors just to see the ending he had planned! granted it would be hard to find someone to play helmer as the character deserves helmer the doctor you love to hate! i think i have yet to see a more self-absorbed oblivious self-righteous character on screen! but i could overlook a change in actorsi just have to know how it ends!<SEP>1
disregard the plot and enjoy fred astaire doing a foggy day and several other dances one a duo with a hapless joan fontaine here we see astaire doing what are essentially stage dances in a purer form than in his films with ginger rogers and before he learned how to take full advantage of the potential of film best of all: the fact that we see burns and allen before their radiotv husband-wife comedy career doing the kind of dancing they must have done in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in their paramount college films from the 30s george was once a tap dance instructor their two numbers with fred are high points of the film and worth waiting for the first soft shoe trio is a warm-up for the chin up exhilarating carnival number in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions it almost seems spontaneous fan of fred astaire and burns & allen will find it worth bearing up under the plot ive seen this one 4 or 5 times and find the fast forward button helpful<SEP>1
some of the background details of this story are based very very loosely on real events of the era in which this was placed the story combines some of the details of the famous leopold and loeb case along with a bit of aimee semple mcphersonthe story begins with two mothers shelley winters and debbie reynolds being hounded as they leave a courtroom the crowd seems most intent on doing them bodily harm as their sons were just convicted of a heinous thrill crime one person in the crowd apparently slashes winters hand as they make their way to a waiting carsoon after they arrive home they begin getting threatening phone calls so reynolds suggests they both move to the west coast together and open a dance school the dance school is s success and they cater to incredibly obnoxious parents who think their child is the next shirley temple one of the parents of these spoiled kids is a multimillionaire who is quite smitten with reynolds and they begin dating life appears very good but when the threatening phone calls begin again winters responds by flipping out--behaving like shes nearing a psychotic break and she retreats further and further into religion--listening on the radio to sister alma almost constantly again and again you see winters on edge and it ultimately culminates in very bad things!! i wont say more as it might spoil this suspenseful and interesting filmin many ways this film is a lot like the bette davis and joan crawford horror films of the 1960s like whatever happened to baby jane straight-jacket and the nanny while none of these are exactly intellectual fare on a kitsch level they are immensely entertaining and fun the writing is very good and there are some nice twists near the end that make it all very exciting winters is great as a fragile and demented lady and reynolds plays one of the sexiest 39 year-olds ive ever seen--plus she can really really dancemy only concern about all this is that some might find winters hyper-religiosity in the film a bit tacky--like a cheap attack on christianity at first i felt that way but when you meet sister alma she seems sincere and is not mocked so i took winters religious zeal as just a sign of craziness--which i assume is all that was intendedby the way this film is packaged along with whoever slew auntie roo--another shelley winters horror film from 1971 both are great funand quite over-the-top!<SEP>1
if you make it through the opening credits this may be your type of movie from the first screen image of a woman holding her hands up to her face with white sheets blowing in the background one recalls a pretentious perfume commercial its all downhill from therethe lead actress is basically a block of wood who uses her computer to reach into the past and reconstruct the memories of photographs to talk historys overlooked genius ada who conceived the first computer language in the 1800sthe low budget graphics would be forgivable if they were interesting or even somewhat integral to the scriptpoor tilda swinton is wasted<SEP>0

a truly truly dire canadian-german co-production the ever-wonderful rosanna arquette plays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term problem child - a few uears prior to the action the child murdered her father and mum took the fall for the offspring now shes moved up to the northwest us to start over but her child still has a problem in that shes devoted to her mother so devoted in fact that she kills anyone who might be seen as a threat to their bondunfortunately mandy schaeffer as the daughter murders more than people - she delivers such a terrible performance that she also wipes out the movie though the incoherent script useless direction and appalling music check out the saxophone the first time she displays her bikini-clad bod dont help any; were supposed to find her sexy and scary but she fails on both counts almost completely unalluring and not even bad enough to be amusing not to mention the fact that arquette and schaeffer dont really convince as mother and daughter all condolences to miss arquette and jurgen prochnow both of whom are worthy of far more than this and both of whom particularly rosanna are the only sane reasons for anyone to sit through this farragoone of the production companies is called quality international films - not since the three-hour love lies and murder from two short productions has there been such a you must be joking credit<SEP>0
geez! this is one of those movies that you think you previously reviewed but you didnt i mean you didnt give a crap about it but somehow it came to your mindto be honest and brief; this is one of the worst boring and stupid slashers ever made i cant say anything good about this piece of crap because there are barely decent sequences that could tell its made by professional film makersthe death scenes are horrible bloodless stupid the plot is somehow good taking in account that it copied popcorn from 1991to make things even worse this isnt a movie so bad that its good its just plain badmolly ringwald tried to do her best but it wasnt enough<SEP>0
it tries to be the epic adventure of the century and with a cast like shô kasugi christopher lee and john-rhys davies it really is the perfect b-adventure of all time its actually is a pretty fun swashbuckling adventure that even with its flaws captures your interest it must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it even if its made in the 90s it doesnt have a modern feel it more has the same feeling that a old errol flynn movie had big adventure movie are again the big thing in hollywood but im afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had this on the other hand just has the real feeling you just cant hate it i think its an okay adventure movie and i really love the soundtrack damn i want the theme song<SEP>1
this is one of the most irritating nonsensical movies ive ever had the misfortune to sit through every time it started to look like it might be getting good out come more sepia tone flashbacks followed by paranoid idiocy masquerading as social commentary the main character maddox is a manipulative would-be rebel who lives in a mansion seemingly without any parents or responsibility the supporting cast are all far more likeable and interesting but are unfortunately never developed nor do we ever really understand the john stanton character supposedly influencing maddox to commit the acts of rebellion at one point i thought aha! maddox is just nuts and is secretly making up all those communications from escaped mental patient stanton! now were getting somewhere! but of course that ends up to not be the case and the whole movie turns out to be pointless both from maddoxs perspective and the viewers wheres ferris bueller when we need him<SEP>0
back in the day of the big studio system the darndest casting decisions were made good old all american james stewart appearing as a hungarian in the shop around the corner had i been casting the film the part of kralik would have been perfect for charles boyer his accent mixed in with all the other european accents would have been nothing stewart had some of the same problem in the mortal storm also with margaret sullavanmargaret sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen he did four films with her but is only this one where neither of them dies sullavan and her husband leland heyward knew stewart back in the day when he was a struggling player in new york in fact sullavans husband was stewarts good friend henry fonda back theni think only clark gable was able to carry off being an american in a cast of non-americans in mutiny on the bounty stewart in the mortal storm was german but all the other players were american as well so nothing stood out but if you can accept stewart than youll be seeing a fine film from ernest lubitsch the plot is pretty simple a man and woman working in a department store in budapest dont get along in person but it seems that they are carrying on a correspondence with some anonymous admirers which turn out to be each other also employer frank morgan suspects stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife though the leads are fine and frank morgan departs from his usual befuddled self the two players who come off best are felix bressart and joseph schildkraut bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after morgan starts asking people for opinions he makes himself very scarceand joseph schildkraut who is always good is just great as the officious little worm who is constantly kissing up to frank morgan you really hate people like that ive known too many like schildkraut in real life who are at office politics 24 hours a day sad that it pays off a good deal of the time<SEP>1
hard to believe perhaps but this film was denounced as immoral from more pulpits than any other film produced prior to the imposition of the bluenose hayes code yes indeed priests actually told their flocks that anyone who went to see this film was thereby committing a mortal sinim not making this up they had several reasons as follows:item: jane likes sex she and tarzan are shown waking up one morning in their treetop shelter she stretches sensuously and with a coquettish look she says tarzan youve been a bad boy! so theyve not only been having sex theyve been having kinky sex! a few years later under the hays code people especially women werent supposed to be depicted as enjoying sexitem: jane prefers a guileless if wise and resourceful savage tarzan to a civilized respectable nine-to-five man holt when holt at first wows her with a pretty dress from london she wavers a bit; when holt tries to kill tarzan and holt and jane both believe hes dead she wavers a lot but when she realizes her man is very much alive the attractions of civilization vanish for her and why not tarzans and janes relationship is egalitarian: he lacks the civilized insecurity that would compel him to assert himself as the head of his wife to boot he lacks many more civilized hangups for example jealousy when holt and his buddy arrive tarzan greets them both cordially knowing perfectly well that holt is janes old flame when holt gets her dolled up in a london dress and is slow-dancing with her to a portable phonograph tarzan drops out of a tree and draws his knife jealous nope hes merely cautious toward the weird music machine since hes never seen one before once its explained hes coolitem: civilized holt is dirty minded savage tarzan is innocently sexy as jane slips into holts lamplit tent holt gets off on watching her silhouette as she changes into the fancy dress by contrast after tarzan playfully pulls the dress off kicks her into the swimming hole and dives in after her there follows the most tastefully erotic nude scene in all cinema: the pair spends five minutes in a lovely water balletthe scene was filmed in three versions--clothed topless and nude--the scene was cut prior to the films release but the nude version is restored in the video now available and when jane emerges and cheetah the chimp steals her dress just for a tease jane makes it clear that her irritation is only because of the proximity of civilized men and their hangups where is the universal prurience so dear to the hearts of seminarians nowhere thats where another reason why the hung up regarded this film as sinful item: the notion that man is the crown of creation and animals are here only for mans use and comfort takes a severe beating holt and his buddy want to be guided to the elephant graveyard so they can scoop up the ivory and take it home they want tarzan to guide them to said graveyard you reader are thinking fat chance! and youre right hes shocked he exclaims elephants sleep! which to him explains everything jane explains tarzans feelings which the two gentlemen find ridiculous item: jane the ex-civilized woman is far more resourceful than the two civilized men she accompanies holt and buddy blow it and find themselves besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals it is jane who maintains her cool while the boys panic she takes charge barks orders at them and passes out the riflesitem: janes costume is a sort of poncho with nothing underneath the original idea was for her to be topless with foliage artistically blocking off her nipples which indeed is the case in one brief scenelastly several men of the cloth complained because the film was called tarzan and his mate rather than tarzan and his wife no comment!of course tarzan who has been nursed back to health by his ape friends comes to the rescue routs the white hunters and induces the pack elephants and african bearers to return the ivory they stole to the sacred place whence it came the endso there you have it an utterly subversive film like all the other films about complex and interesting women see eg possessed with rita hayworth and raymond massey which constituted such a flowing genre in the early 30s and which were brought to such an abrupt end by the adoption of the hays code the joie de vivre of this film is best expressed by janes soprano version of the famous tarzan yell a nice touch which was unfortunately abandoned in future productionslets hear it for artistic freedom feminist jane and sex<SEP>1
despite the other comments listed here this is probably the best dirty harry movie made; a film that reflects -- for better or worse -- the countrys socio-political feelings during the reagan glory years of the early 80s its also a kickass action movieopening with a liberal female judge overturning a murder case due to lack of tangible evidence and then going straight into the coffee shop encounter with several unfortunate hoodlums the scene which prompts the famous go ahead make my day line sudden impact is one non-stop roller coaster of an action film the first time you get to catch your breath is when the troublesome inspector callahan is sent away to a nearby city to investigate the background of a murdered hood it gets only better from there with an over-the-top group of grotesque thugs for callahan to deal with along with a sherriff with a mysterious past superb direction and photography and a at-times hilarious script help make this film one of the best of the 80s<SEP>1
i have seen slaughter high several times over the years and always found it was an enjoyable slasher flick with an odd sense of humor but i never knew that it was filmed in the uk and i never knew that the actor that plays marty rantzen simon scuddamore committed suicide after the film was released i guess i did notice while watching it last night that the actors phrasing seems rather odd for americans and a few of them arent very good at hiding their english accentsall that aside though this is the tale of the class nerd marty who is the butt of jokes from his classmates and on one particular day april fools day hes lured into the girls locker room by one caroline munro yes playing a teenager and humiliated big time on film of course the coach catches the gang at work & theyre all given a vigorous workout to punish them but not before a couple of the guys slip marty a joint which he tries to smoke in the chemistry lab but its full of something that makes him sick & when he runs to the restroom one of his classmates slips in and puts a chemical that reacts with something marty is mixing which results in a fire and the spill of a bottle of nitric acid which leaves poor marty burned & horribly scarredten years later this same gang is headed for their class reunion at good old doddsville high which seems oddly boarded up and inaccessible but thanks to ingenuity they manage to get in and find the place seemingly derelictexcept theres a room where a banquet and liquor is laid out and so of course they eat drink and be merry for soon they will die of coursethe gang is stalked one-by-one by a figure in a jesters mask but could it be marty they dont know they figure hes either in a loony bin or working for ibm theyre not sure which but whoever it is hes making quick work of them particularly nasty is the girl that takes a bath to wash blood off her from one of her classmates whose innards popped all over her when he drank poisoned beer she is victim to an acid bath which i believe may have been one of the parts originally cut in the tape version because it seemed extra nasty when i watched it this time i could be wrong but i believe that wasnt on the tapeat any rate theres somewhat of a twist ending and that also contains footage not on the tape i believe theres also a bit of frontal nudity early on that was also excised but apart from that i didnt really notice if there were other bits on this uncut version probably so but its been a while since ive last seen itat any rate if youre a fan of 80s slasher flicks then snap up the new release dvd because its a fun little slasher with a good atmosphere & feel to it 7 out of 10<SEP>1
this could be the most underrated movie of its genre i dont remember seeing any advertisements or commercials for this one which could be the reason why it didnt do so well at the box office however frailty is an excellent and a truly original horror movie i rank it within the top 10 most favorite horror movies on my listmovie begins with snapshots of photos and news articles telling us about a killer who calls himself gods hand and then a man walks into a police station and tells the chief officer that he knows the killer is his brother two of them leave together to go to a location where victims are buried which might help solve the case during that trip the man begins telling the story of his brother and we go back in time when the events began fenton and adam are two young brothers living with their strict and religious father who one day claims that he has received a divine message from god asking him to kill the demons that appear to be regular human beings he receives from god a list of names of demons to be destroyed and asks his sons to help him carry out this divine missionthis is an absolutely horrifying and suspenseful film that will keep you at the edge of your seat the tension runs high innocent people or demons get killed and religious experiences are questioned it has not one but few very intelligent twists at the end if you like this genre i highly recommend frailty for you i own the dvd and it is one of my all time favorite horror-thrillers<SEP>1

its difficult to precisely put into words the sheer awfulness of this film an entirely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything even remotely recognizable as humor or even entertainment in rabbit test so as a small contribution to this future effort id like to suggest this word: hubiriffic adj a combination of hubristic and terrific; used to describe overly ambitious debacles like the film rabbit testjoan rivers and hollywood squares producer jay redack have severely over-reached their meager abilities to amuse in this 82-minute festival of wretchedness trying to put together an airplane! style comedy with a moldy collection of gags note to joan: german doctors havent been funny since vaudeville disinterred from their graves in the catskills - thats is bad enough but compounding this cinematic crime is rivers directorial style which can best be described as ugly and a cast of once-and-future has-beens so eager to please they overplay even the weakest of throwaway gagsadrift in this sargasso sea of sap is a hapless billy crystal in his film debut role as the films hapless protagonist lionel watching crystal in this pic is much like watching a blind person take a stroll in a minefield; eventually the cringe reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition as cheap joke after cheap joke blows up in his facei can only speculate about the sort of audience who might actually like rabbit test cabbages mollusks and mildly retarded lizards are all likely candidates but for self-aware thinking humans - id enthusiastically recommend pouring bleach in your eyes before id recommend rabbit test<SEP>0
the fact that this movie made it all the way to the rentalrack in norway is bizarre this movie is just awful this image quality is just one teeny bit better than you get of a mobile phone and the plot is soooo bad the main character is just plain annoying and the rest just suck every person affiliated with this movie should be ashamed the fact that the people that made this movie put their name on this is extraordinary and the distributors; did they even see it! this is probably the worst movie i have ever seen to label this a comedy is an insult to mankind i urge you not to support this movie by buying or renting it<SEP>0

i saw this when it premiered and just re-watched it on ifc again this is a great telling of the many possible stories about the immigrant farmworker population that came to hawaii to work the sugar plantations in the early 1900s my grandparents were part of that migration; my parents were born on a kohala plantation big island at the time setting of the movie i moved to the big island over a year ago after living in california for over 30 years i was surprised to see that many of the former cane growing lands are still undeveloped with wild cane still growing years after the plantations closed ive heard many stories from my aunts and uncles who were kids growing up on the plantation this movie helps to image those kinds of stories and memories this story is more of an historical document than a romantic plot-driven movie it leaves me shaking my head to read a review like ccthemoviemans some people just dont get iti didnt recall that youki kudoh had the starring role with which she did an incredible job i recall her great performances in jim jarmuschs mystery train and in an australian film co- starring with russell crowe heavens burning tamlyn tomita did a great job with her pidgin english especially for someone who didnt grow up in the islands i had forgotten that toshiro mifune had a cameo role as the moving picture show narrator and i missed the fact that jason scott lee had an uncredited non-speaking part as one of the plantation workers during the payday scene i was saddened to find out that the director and co-writer kayo hatta died in an accidental drowning in 2005 there are two other excellent foreign films that mirror this cane plantation experience: gaijin about the immigrant cane workers in brazil many of them japanese in the same time period; and sugar cane alley about the cane plantation experience in africa the latter is still available but gaijin sadly doesnt appear to have been shown in quite a while another great film about the early asian in america experience when immigrants were more like slaves is a thousand pieces of gold this was set over the chinese workers involvement in the building of the railroad starred rosalind chao chris cooper michael paul chan and dennis dun<SEP>1
i can understand those who dislike this movie cause of a lack of knowledgefirst of all those girls are not geisha but brothel tenants and one that dont know the difference will not understand half of the movie and certainly not the end this is a complete art work about the womens life and needs in this era everything is important and certainly the way they dress all over the movie means more than words to those who thought it was a boring geisha movie ill suggest you to read a bit about this society before making a conclusion that is so out of the reality this is kurosawas work of is life and im sure that the director understood the silent meaning of kurosawas piece to the right intellectual range<SEP>1
this is probably the worst movie ever made it is just to bad the name of roger corman is associated with it i couldve understand it in his early years when he had lower budgets but nowadays there is no excuses for giving birth to this! im a b movie pervert and from certain people point of view all the flicks i love are put aside by regular viewers but take my word on this one vampire club makes the top of my list of the best of worstits hard to imagine vampires with no fangs the music score is totally out of placethe sound effects are just not effective and finally mrsavage doesnt seem to know he is in a vampire movie at all witch is too bad cause he had a not to bad career over all let me know if im to hard on this one cause when i dont like a movie i tend to forget about its good side<SEP>0
while the original titillates the intellect this cheap remake is designed purely to shock the sensibilities instead of intricate plot-twists this so-called thriller just features sudden and seemingly random story changes that serve only to debase it further with each bizarre development worst of all replacing the original spicy dialog is an overturned saltshaker full of unnecessary four-letter words leaving behind a stark but uninteresting tastethere was promise--unfulfilled promise the prospect of michael caine pulling off a patty duke-like keller-to-sullivan graduation is admittedly intriguing unfortunately this brilliant and respected actor only tarnished his reputation first by accepting the role in this horribly re-scripted nonsense and then by turning in a performance that only looks competent when compared to jude laws amateurish overactingif you havent seen the classic original overlook its dated visuals and gimmicks hunt it down watch it and just enjoy a story-and-a-half as for the remake pass on this insult to the original<SEP>0
after hearing about george orwells prophetic masterpiece for all of my life im now 37 but never having read the book i am totally confused as to what ive just seeni am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel as im sure most are but only through hearsay and quotes without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery and even with it im still no more educated about the story of 1984 than i was before i watched iton the plus sidethe cinematography is amazing hurt & burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate the prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film makingnow for the down sides and there are plentythere is a war going on at least as far as the propaganda is concerned but why & with who nothing is explained there are a couple of names bandied about eurasia etc but they mean nothing without explanationwho is winston what does he do where does he come from where does he work why is he changing news reports why isnt he on the front line why doesnt he eat the food in the canteen what is that drink hes drinking through the entire film why is he so weak & ill why isnt he brainwashed like the rest of them whats the deal with his mother & sister what happened to his father a little back story would have been nice no scrub that essential for those like myself that havent read the book without it this is just a confusing and hard to follow art-house movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going onthe soundtrack was dis-jointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the big brother screens swamps the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out whats going on i accept that this may have been an artistic choice but its very annoying all the samealso i know this has been mentioned before but why all the nudity it just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coveragei personally cant abide the way hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days we are not all brainwashed simpletons but this is a few steps too far the other way i can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that youve read the book because if this film really is the literal translation that ive seen many people say i would find it very hard to understand why 1984 is hailed as the classic it istheres no denying that it was light years ahead of its time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be but many sci-fi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storylinei guess i have to do what i should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if im to make any sense out of thisall in all very disappointed in something ive waited for years to watch<SEP>0
of course the plot script and especially casting are strong in the film so many fine things to see one aspect i liked especially is the idea of the antagonist--luzhinis turturros--ex-mentor working his evil on the sidelines his chess opponent--an italian dandy in three piece and cane--turns out to be a real gent and a truly fine chess player to his credit the opponent nobly goes along with the plan at the end to complete the final game for the championship posthumously luzhin has taken a flyer out a window--sad but so releasing to himby way of the unstable genius widow emily watson in death then because of the gallantry of an honorable chess master luzhins defence which he worked out in a late moment of lucidity is allowed to be played the italian gent commends the play and calls it brilliant talk about a dramatic end game!<SEP>1
the secret of kells is an astonishing first animated feature which will dazzle your eye and move your heart the shortcomings of the films limited budget and sometimes limited animation are more than compensated for by the visual poetry of the story of young brendans heroic quest to become a master illuminator during the dark ages historically this was in the late 8th century when the centers of irish learning were over-run by the vikings the vikings appear here as brute antagonists the equivalent on the north seas of the plundering huns and mongols further east the films narrative--- which functions more as a parable--- centers around the conflict between brendan who seeks to create beauty in his illuminations during a time of encroaching darkness and his stern uncle the abbot-- who seeks to protect the town of kells and his nephew with a looming wall as barrier against the norsemen the abbot disregards the value of brendans art in his quest for security this is the movies outer conflict brendans inner conflict is to find the hidden eye of creative illumination which will allow him to complete the most difficult painting in the book of kells this eye is guarded by a dragon ouroboros who destroys from within those not suited to this quest as surely as the vikings will kill from without thats as much of the story as ill divulge!what i really like about this film is its creators imaginative understanding of some of the greatest art work to survive in the west from 1200 years ago the characters are stylized in flat abstract shapes defined by line just as in the original book of kells particularly noteworthy is monk aidans pet cat defined in few lines yet purely--- and even magically metamorphically feline the range of emotion which brendan and the other animated characters convey given their economy of abstract design is a tribute to the excellent artistry of the director and his animators the decorative borders on the edge of the picture change to complement the dramatic impact of a given scene and this characteristic of illuminations from the dark ages is brought to wondrous animated life in the secret of kells of course historical dramas usually tell us more about our own times than the times which these dramas endeavor to depict however by introducing archetypal elements into this story the writers and director of the secret of kells convey a numinous sense of lived-life from that far-off time in ireland which feels psychologically true however much the script might stray from pedantic historical fact the united nations band of illuminators who appear as a rogues club of artists in the secret of kells arent historically probable but theyre all well-designed individuated characters who do much to convey the universal appeal of this quintessentially irish story animation has always seemed the best vehicle to me to better help us understand the visual art of different times and cultures the magnificent art direction of this movie clearly derives from its historical visual source but has also been cleverly adapted to the demands of animated storytelling; if animation had existed in the dark ages the secret of kells is what it would look like! finally brendans heros quest in this film is the artists perennial quest to convey the spirit of beauty life and inspiration without being preachy or even particularly christian this movie affirms jesus dictum that man does not live by bread alone in my estimation the most inspired movie about the creative process of visual artists is andrei tarkovskys andrei rublev a film about the great russian icon painter of the 15th century the secret of kells expresses much the same sense of mystery and exhilaration about the artists visual quest and creative process its certainly not as profound as andrei rublev but--- heck--- its a cartoon! and one which will appeal to young and old alike i think this movie will hold up well to repeated viewing: in its own modest life-affirming way this stylized secret of kells is a classic<SEP>1
im going to go on the record as the second person who has after years of using the imdb to look up movies been motivated by nachos film the abandoned to create an account and post a comment this was hands down the worst movie ive ever seen in my entire life the plot was on the verge of non-existence and none of the puzzle-pieces added up in any way whatsoever the acting was laughable and the writing was embarrassing how this film got backed and came to be is completely beyond me the only saving grace i could find was anastasia hilles cunning and repetitive use of the f word and brilliant sound design if i were faced with the option of seeing this film again or being mauled by wild bores i would be up against a difficult decision im disappointed that i am unable to give it 0 stars<SEP>0
story of a good-for-nothing poet and a sidekick singer who puts his words to music director danny boyle has lost none of his predilection for raking in the gutter of humanity for characters but he has lost in this film the edge for creating inspiring and funny films strumpet is painful to watch and barely justified by the fact that it was made for tv<SEP>0
ashley judd in an early role and i think her first starring role shows her real-life rebellious nature in this slow-moving feminist soap opera wow is this a vehicle for political correctness and extreme liberalism or whatbeing a staunch feminist in real life she must have cherished this script no wonder left wing critic roger ebert loved this movie; its right up his political alley toounlike the reviewers here i am glad judd elevated herself from this moronic fluff to better roles in movies that entertained not preached the heavy-handed liberal agenda<SEP>0
the trailers for this film were better than the movie what waste of talent and money wish i wouldve waited for this movie to come on dvd because at least i wouldnt be out $9 the movie totally misses the mark what could have been a great movie for all actors turned out to be a b-movie at best movie moved very slow and just when i thought it was going somewhere it almost did but then it didnt in this day and age we need unpredictable plot twists and closures in film and this film offered neither the whole thing about how everyone is a suspect is good however not sure if it was the way it was directed the lighting the delivery of lines the writing or what but nothing came from it lot of hype for nothing i was very disappointed in this film and im telling everyone not to see it the cheesy saxophone music throughout made the film worse as well and the ending had nothing to do with the rest of the film what a disappointment<SEP>0
this movie was awful and an insult to the viewer stupid script bad casting endless boredomin the usual tradition of hollywood the government of the us is shown as always evil the communist-sympathizer nitwits in hollywood most of whom are as dumb as a box of rocks love taking the lone nutcase eugene mccarthy and picturing him as the leader of a vast movement the truth is that at the time he was considered a fringe character who was exploiting a legitimate concern about the soviet communists for political gainoh yeah and the us brought over all those evil nazis like werner vonbraun without whom we would have no space program he actually loved being american and became a great asset to the countryand yet the irony is that the fools in hollywood an uneducated lot who live a fantasy existence still believe that the government should run everything and give us all what we want and yet this is the same government that they continually portray as a consummate evil in films like this<SEP>0
the premise is amazing and the some of the acting notably sally kellerman and anthony rapp is charming but this film is near unwatchable the music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap most of the singing is off-key i think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it the dialogue is really stupid and trite the movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical sub-plots i found myself checking my watch after ther first twenty minutes and after 40 wondering when is it ever going to end<SEP>0
you know our spirit is based on that revolution its asleep i can explain i think!! well until that happen on 25th april 1974 our freedom was limited we didnt had liberty of speech but when we got it at the revolution it seems that portuguese people lost his opinion we dont use our liberty of speech! thats all a consequence of the revolution! i think thats clear! about the movie i think that it has a few mistakes on some characters acting but by the way i use to watch on portuguese movies its quite good!! i like it very much!<SEP>1
kept my attention from start to finish great performances added to this tremendous film mr pacino once again gives us another brilliant character to enjoy<SEP>1
okay my title is kinda lame and almost sells this flick short i remember watching siskel & ebert in 94 talking about this movie and then playing a clip or two not being a rap-conscious guy although i could identify snoop dogg vanilla ice and mc hammer music i wasnt much interested when they started talking about the film but then s&e showed the scene where the band explains how they picked their name using some shady logic and a bunch of made up facts and then another scene where the band and their rival band both visit a school to promote getting involved and of course nwh comes up with some info about how the rival band leader is a loser because he got good grades in school and was on the yearbook committee so i filed it away that i should see this moviea couple of years later this thing shows up on hbo and i recorded it only to laugh my butt off for hours yes it has a spinal tap kind of rhythm to iteven the documentarist takes essentially the same tone in setting up the clips and the band follows a similar path what i now call the behind the music phenomenon - smalltime band has good chemistry gets famous too much money too fast squabbling drugs some type of death band breaks up then reconciles finishing with a hope for more albums in the future and fade to black the one thing that is true is that in spinal tap you catch the band perhaps with a little more success in their past but tap drags at some points and in my mind is reduced to laughs that are set up by specific scenes oh this is his rant about the backstage food this is spot where he wants the amp to go to eleven this is the spot where the guy makes the pint-sized stonehenge etccontrasting to foabh which seems to have more unexpected humor you can see some of it coming but there isnt a big setup for every joke sometimes the jokes just kinda flow cundieff and the other actors in the band had a real chemistry that worked also the direct references to vanilla ice hammer and a bunch of other caricature-type rappers really worked well this strikes me as a film you watch once to get the main story and laughs and then go back and watch to catch the subtle jokes and the songs is my peanuts better than big bottom from spinal tap i dont know - but theyre both damn funny tone defs awful video during his awakening phase is so bizarre yet so funnyi could go on awhile but save your time and dont waste it on cb4 i watched the first half hour and got bored you dont get bored on foabh there are slightly less funny moments but you can never tell when something good is about to happen perhaps my favorite scene is when ice cold and tastey taste name ripoffs if ive ever heard any discover theyve been sharing the same girlat one point youve got those two pointing guns at each other and the next thing you know the manager the photographer the girl and i think even tone def are in the room pointing guns at each other switching targets back and forth and of course someone does get shoti did find it odd that nwhs managers suffered similar fates to spinal taps drummers although none spontaneously combusted i dont think there were enough similarities that i cannot ignore the likelihood that cundieff saw spinal tap prior to writing this film although this is clearly much more the spinal tap of hip-hop while some similarities exist the humor is different and the movie seems more like a real documentary maybe because we dont recognize a single actor in this thing even the guy who played lamar from revenge of the nerds all in all this movie has in my opinion street cred kinda like nwh<SEP>1
this could have been interesting  a japan-set haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newly-installed american family  but falls flat due to an over-simplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and directorthe film suffers from the same problem i often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare ie the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that theyre expected to! besides it doesnt deliver much in the scares department  a giant crab attack is merely silly  as generally the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way such as susan george seducing diplomatfriend-of-the-family doug mcclure and edward albert force-feeding his daughter a bowl of soup! at one point an old monk turns up at the house to warn albert of the danger if they remain there  eventually hes called upon to exorcise the premises however history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation duly created  leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which albert and mcclure possessed by the spirits of their japanese predecessors engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death! at the end of the day this emerges an innocuous time-waster  tolerable at just 88 minutes but in no way essential viewing<SEP>0
when i refer to malice as a film noir i am not likening it to such masterpieces as sunset boulevard double indemnity or the maltese falcon nor am i comparing director becker to alfred hitchcock stanley kubrick stanley kramer or luis bunuel i am merely registering a protest against the darkness that pervades this movie from start to finish to the extent that most of the time you simply cannot make out what is going on i can understand darkness in night scenes but this movie was dark even in broad daylight for what reason i am at loss to understand as it is however it wouldnt have made much difference if director becker had filmed it in total darkness<SEP>0
huge ramones fan i do like the ramones and i suppose if you hate them then besides being a avid bush supporter you might not like this classicits immensely better than the sappy john hughes teen films and the like that littered the 80s infinitely better than the american pies that plague us nowthere are some other great high school films: switchblade sisters fast times class of 84 three oclock high and the cheesy yet grippingdoesnt seem possible rivers edge but rnrhs will always be my favorite because its the funniest and most fun plus you can get up and dance with iti love you riff randell1010<SEP>1
repetitive music annoying narration terrible cinematography effects half of the plot seemed centered around shock value and the other half seemed to be focused on appeasing the type of crowd that would nag at people to start a fightone of the best scenes was in the deleted scenes section the one where shes in the principles office with her mom i dont understand why theyd cut that the movie seemed desperate to make a point about anything it could and domino talking about sororities would have been a highlight of the movieridiculous camera work is reminiscent of mtv and completely not needed or helpful to a movie speeding the film up just to jump past a lot of things and rotating the camera around something repeatedly got old the first time it was used its like the directors are wanting to use up all this extra footage they didnt want to throw awayanother movie with jerry springer in it that shouldve told me not to watch it from the previewa popular movie for the in crowd<SEP>0
demer davesis a wonderful director when it comes to westerns and broken arrow remains in everybodys mindas far as melodrama is concernedhe should leave that to knowing people like vincente minelligeorge cukor or the fabulous douglas sirk the screenplay is so predictable that you will not be surprised once while you are watching such a tepid weepienatalie wood s character was inspired by fannie hursts imitation of life see stahl and sirkbut who could believe shes a black mans daughter anywaysusan kohner was more credible in imitation of lifeand sinatra and curtis are given so stereotyped parts that they cannot do anything with them:the poor officerand the wealthy good-looking -and mean- sergeantguess whom will natalie fall in love withfrance is shown as a land of tolerance where interracial unions are warmly welcomeat the timecirca 1944 it was dubiousit still is for narrow-minded people you can find here there and everywhere<SEP>0
this film is self indulgent rubbish watch this film if you merely want to hear spoken gaelic or enjoy the pleasant soundtrack watch for any other reason and you will be disappointed it should be charming but isnt - its just irritating the characters are difficult to care about and the acting is poor the stories within the film are also charmless and sinister i was expecting a heartwarming family film but this also held no appeal to my fourteen year old daughter it is rarely that i cannot see a film through to its conclusion but this one got the better of both of usalthough the film is set in current times it has the look and feel of a cheap east european film made during the cold war there isnt even enough in the way of beautiful scottish scenery and cinematography to redeem it a real shame because as a film this is an embarrassment to scotland<SEP>0
there is no relation at all between fortier and profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes profiler looks crispy fortier looks classic profiler plots are quite simple fortiers plot are far more complicated fortier looks more like prime suspect if we have to spot similarities the main character is weak and weirdo but have clairvoyance people like to compare to judge to evaluate how about just enjoying funny thing too people writing fortier looks american but on the other hand arguing they prefer american series !!! maybe its the language or the spirit but i think this series is more english than american by the way the actors are really good and funny the acting is not superficial at all<SEP>1
i totally got drawn into this and couldnt wait for each episode the acting brought to life how emotional a missing person in the family must be together with the effects it would have on those closest the only problem we as a family had was how quickly it was all explained at the end we couldnt hear clearly what was said and have no idea what garys part in the whole thing was why did kyle phone him and why did he go along with it having invested in a series for five hours we felt cheated that only five minutes was kept back for the conclusion i have asked around and none of my friends who watched it were any the wiser either very strange but maybe we missed something crucial<SEP>1
this is what a movie should be when trying to capture the essence of that which is very surreal it has this hazy overtone that is rarely captured on film it feels like a dream sequence and really moves you into a dark haunting memory the kids were extremely believable and i do expect some things to come of them in the future very natural acting for such young ones i dont know if bill pulled it out of them or there just that good but no the less excellent bill scored as far as im concerned and for the comment by kevnjeff about mr paxtons bad acting what can one do in that role he played the part rather well in my opinion this is coming from someone who said hamlet was good the ethan hawke version wow do not listen to his comments great flick to make you feel really uncomfortable if thats what you want cinematography gets an above the average rating also<SEP>1
there are enough sad stories about women and their oppression by religious political and societal means not to diminish the films and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights as well as wage inequality and marginalization in society all in the name of allah or god or some other ridiculous justification but sometimes it is helpful to just take another approach and shed some light on the subjectthe setting is the 2006 match between iran and bahrain to qualify for the world cup passions are high and several women try to disguise themselves as men to get into the matchthe women who were caught played by sima mobarak-shahi shayesteh irani ayda sadeqi golnaz farmani and mahnaz zabihi and detained for prosecution provided a funny and illuminating glimpse into the customs of this country and most likely all muslim countries their interaction with the iranian soldiers who were guarding and transporting them both city and villagers and the father who was looking for his daughter provided some hilarious moments as we thought about why they have such unwritten rulesit is mainly about a paternalistic society that feels it has to save its women from the crude behavior of its men rather than educating the male population they deny privilege and rights to the womenseeing the changes in the soldiers responsible and the reflection of iranian society it is nos surprise this film will not get any play in iran but jafar panahi has a winner on his hands for those able to see it<SEP>1
yes as the other reviewers have already stated this may not be vintage l&h but its far from being their worst work as at 20th century stupidi mean fox this film certainly has all of the basic ingredients for things to go wrong for the boys but its their serious approach and determination that makes them funny they dont play it for laughs as other comedians might but they take their work and situation quite seriously and that is the essence of their eternal humor in this film they are faced with some basic issues that really might be encountered by any one of us today namely job related stress first we would get checked out by a doctor and he would prescribe some much needed rest and perhaps staying by the sea thats where the surrealness comes in to all of this l&h always take a most plausible set of circumstances and exaggerate it but never to the point of being incredible except maybe once in awhile this makes us laugh because we can relate to their self caused predicaments and attempts at extrication thats what makes stan and ollie universal in their appeal in this film all those ingredients are presented in a delightfully artful and gracefully slapstick way not their best in comparison to their earlier work probably because this was the actual last film they did for roach because he wanted to mirror the big studios and go into making features exclusively and also wanted to hurry up and finish their contractual obligation big mistake! they should have all stayed together and continued for maybe five more years what the world may have missed in their not considering this as an option watch laugh and enjoy this as their last great performance<SEP>1
as an inspiring director myself this movie was exciting to watch with criticism in mind shot with low end digital camera probably with 35mm adapter for dof the editing is good acting decent sound effects arent too over the top i would have give it a 7 for an indie film but the story arent that interesting its more on the drama side character developments than a horror flickits not for those who wants to get spooked startled frightened grossed out or sit down with popcorn to just enjoyhonestly this movie would be good if we were still in the 50sthis movie is about a family who has a dry field and that is just that<SEP>0
the author of nekromantik jörg buttgereits second feature film der todesking is a powerful masterpiece centered around a chain letter originating from a group called the brotherhood of the 7th day the movie shows 7 episodes each consisting of one day during one week where suicide is approached using different characters and situations all the while the letter is making its rounds do not touch this one if you like hollywood movies or musicals enjoy happy or even remotely normal movies or expect a movie to be good only if it is focused on stage actingthe nihilistic avant-garde approach of der todesking well explains why buttgereits movies in general were banned in germany their native country of origin during the 80s and most of the 90s der todesking is not really focused on the characters appearing on-screen but the meaningless apathy or depression most peoples lives consist of in general buttgereit does not find reasons to go on living only reasons to stop and in choosing how and when you die you can also be the king of death der todeskingbuttgereits movies are generally difficult to categorize and der todesking is no exception featuring the same crew and almost the same cast as all other of his movies art film would probably be the closest description every time der todesking features an original method to shoot create the mood and handle the central object in almost every scene during one scene the camera slowly continuously pans in 360 degree circle while a person lives in a small one-room apartment for a day during another buttgereit uses sound and film corruption to depict the collapsing mental state of a man while he dwells in his desperation during a third seemingly pleasant scene names ages and occupations of actual people to have committed suicide are shown on-screen supposedly warranting the ban in germany for this particular movieepisode movies and especially this one as the scenes are only vaguely connected generally suffer from incoherence and der todesking is no exception while all episodes have the same focus of inflicted death and its consequences or subsequences in all its variations there are very powerful episodes yet an episode or two might even seem like filler material partly draining the overall power of the movie - still the the jaw-dropping immensely powerful intermissions depicting a decomposing body manage to keep the movie together and cleanse it from its more vague moments back to the status of greatness the general atmosphere is baffling awe-inspiring highly depressing and sometimes even disgusting - so much so that dozens of people left in the middle of the movie during a theater showing in a film festival i took part ofthis is one movie that does leave a lasting impression and i strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a special experience and something they will definitely remember in years to come not recommended for the faint of heart or show time fans this is a small different movie that truly raises feelings in the audience whether it be confusion amazement or even hate you arent likely to be left cold by this in my opinion the best achievement of this small indie crewthe main theme of the movie die fahrt ins reich der menschentrümmer part i-iii was released in a limited 666-piece 8 vinyl edition which is now much sought after you still can get the classical masterpiece by getting the nekromantik soundtrack cd which i highly recommend the lo-fi synthesizer music in the movie is dark and quirky almost illbient-like makes an essential part of the movies atmosphere and is something you would very very rarely hear otherwise much recommended!<SEP>1
this bogus journey never comes close to matching the wit and craziness of the excellent adventure these guys took in their first movie this installment tries to veer away from its prequel to capture some new blood out of the joke but it takes a wrong turn and journeys nowhere interesting or funnytheres almost a half-hour wasted on showing the guys doing a rock concert and lots of people watching on free tv--since when does that happen surely the script writer could have done something more creative; look at how all the random elements of the first movie were neatly tied up together by a converging them at the science presentation not in this film which pretty much ended the bill & ted franchise the joke was overthe grim reaper is tossed into the mix for whatever reason this infusion like the whole plot is done poorly and lacks sparks for comedy or audience involvement theres a zz top impression hammered in for no reason theres lights smoke mirrors noise but nothing really creative or funnyskip this bogus thing<SEP>0
le grand voyage is a gentle miracle of a film a work made more profound because of its understated script by writerdirector ismaël ferroukhi who allows the natural scenery of this road trip story and the sophisticated acting of the stars nicolas cazalé and mohamed majd to carry the emotional impact of the film ferroukhis vision is very capably enhanced by the cinematography of katell djian a sensitive mixture of travelogue vistas of horizons and tightly photographed duets between characters and the musical score by fowzi guerdjou who manages to maintain some beautiful themes throughout the film while paying homage to the many local musical variations from the numerous countries the film surveys reda nicolas cazalé lives with his muslim family in southern france a young student with a western girlfriend who does not seem to be following the religious direction of his heritage his elderly father mohamed majd has decided his time has come to make his hadj to mecca and being unable to drive requests the reluctant reda to forsake his personal needs to drive him to his ultimate religious obligation the two set out in a fragile automobile to travel through france into italy and on through bulgaria croatia slovenia and turkey to saudi arabia along the trip reda pleads with his father to visit some of the interesting sights but his father remains focused on the purpose of the journey and reda is irritably left to struggle with his fathers demands on their pilgrimage they encounter an old woman ghina ognianova who attaches herself to the two men and must eventually be deserted by reda a turkish man mustapha jacky nercessian who promises to guide the fatherson duo but instead brings about a schism by getting reda drunk in a bar and disappearing and countless border patrol guards and custom agents who delay their progress for various reasons tensions between father and son mount: reda cannot understand the importance of this pilgrimage so fraught with trials and mishaps and the father cannot comprehend redas insensitivity to the fathers religious beliefs and needs at last they reach mecca where they are surrounded by hoards of pilgrims from all around the world and the sensation of trips significance is overwhelming to reda the manner in which the story comes to a close is touching and rich with meaning it has taken a religious pilgrimage to restore the gap between youth and old age between son and father and between defiance and acceptance of religious values the visual impact of this film is extraordinary - all the more so because it feels as though the camera just happens to catch the beauty of the many stopping points along the way without the need to enhance them with special effects nicolas cazalé is a superb actor be sure to see his most recent and currently showing film the grocers son and it is his carefully nuanced role that brings the magic to this film another fine film from the film movement this is a tender story brilliantly told highly recommended grady harp<SEP>1
this films makes no pretentious efforts to hide its true genre -- a campy b movie it will flat out tell you in the beginning the definition of campy it should have also given the adjective meaning of cheese but the two come together in this film in ways that make you go hmmmmm thats so stupid! and then have you laughing for example there is a scene back in 16th century japan which shows a couple of samurai walking in the foreground of a temple in the background of the temple there are several tourists looking off in the distance in slippers and shorts hmmmm hahahah! i could not stop laughing and the acting goes from decent to bearable to oh my lord but thats what makes it funny youll see some decent actors and then find others really terrible i have to digress somewhat though because i have seen stephanie sanchez in several plays and she is awesome her air time in the film was pretty short though i have also seen bryan yamasaki in several plays in the islands during my visits and hes also better in theatre than in this movie anyhow its an entertaining film if youve got nothing to do on a weekday evening<SEP>1
my watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the sequel togetherwhich makes me compliment the makers of this flick for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romanticism and very marginally separating it from the idea of relationships! as a lot has been written about the movie already it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally lovedi think the point where jesse and celine make phony phone calls to their respective friends was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending 24 hrs the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly dealt withon the plot front making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplishi believe in romantic flicks of such flavor the characters are not clearly designed even in the writers and directors mind what the actors bring out is what becomes of them right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify to become the character the life the actor gives has to go beyond instructions and the storyhere both the actors do just the right job! kudos!!!and before sunset is another feather which makes this one even more beautiful!<SEP>1
i just sat through a very enjoyable fast paced 45 mins of rollroll is about a country boy mat toby malone who has dreams of becoming a sports star mat travels to the city and is to be picked up by his cousin george damien robertson well that was the plan anyway george is involved with a gangster tiny john batchelor and is making a delivery for him needless to say mat gets dragged into georges world i thought it was great how mat teaches george some morals and respect while george teaches mat how to relax and enjoy life a little toby and damien were well cast together and did an outstanding jobevery character in the movie complimented each other very well the two cops were great david ngoombujarra brought some great comic relief to the movie tiny played a likable gangster that reminded me of one of my favourite characters pando from two handsone of the other things that i liked about roll was that it showcased the cities that i grew up and lived in for 20 years perth and fremantle it was good to see sights and landmarks that i grew up with especially the old ferris wheelthis rocks n rolls<SEP>1
this is my favorite all time movie it used to be my friday night movie with a pizza and bottle of wine when i was single i first saw this movie with my aunt brend and sister chasity i was in the 2nd grade i fell in love with travolta and sissy was my new best friend ive read a lot of comments about why bud left sissy & how sissy has to learn to act married but lets go back and look at this for a second: spoiler - my interpretation of the movie now not when i was eight is this about bud & sissys relationship takes a turn for the worst because she makes a fool of him at gilleys riding the bull they get in a huge fight bud tries to make sissy jealous by asking pam to dance sissy then thinks two wrongs will make a right and wes asks her if she needs any help theyre all on the dance floor acting like fools when bud asks pam when are you going to take me home and rape me pam answers: when ever youre ready cowboy bud then goes home with pam to her condo in downtown houston which daddy has bought for her with his oil money and all that that implies bud is the one who cheats on sissy sissy is waiting for bud when he returns home the next day sissy is the one who leaves bud then its up to bud to prove to sissy that he is a real cowboy and win her back anyways thats my interpretation everyone has their im sure! i love this movieand believe it or not i got myself a real cowboy! i love him too! :<SEP>1
this one is tough to watch -- as an earlier reviewer says that is amazing considering the terrible films that came out right after wwii -- particularly the liberation of dachau it is clear that as of the middle of the war we knew exactly what was happening to the jews the sequence that shows a transport is vivid almost as if based upon an actual newsreel the nazis liked to record their atrocities knox as the nazi is brilliant he charts the course of a nazi career that charting is particularly telling when contrasted with the reactions of other germans at first laughing at hitler then incredulous and finally helpless that contrast however permits us to believe in the conversion of one young nazi officer to an anti-nazi stance that did happen as witness the several attempts against hitler most notably the staffenberg plot which occurred as this film was coming out a strong film effectively using flashbacks accurately predicting the nuremburg trails and others that would occur once the war ended<SEP>1
without being one of my favorites this is good for being a change of pace even if only for a few minutesit all starts with a big fight between tom jerry and spike who is renamed butch here theyre all beating each other but suddenly spike makes a heroic and admirable decision: he stops the fight and suggests that they all should be friends so all of them sign a peace treaty and become friends which isnt going to last for longmeanwhile the three become affectionate patient and kind to each other they even save each other when one of them is in danger of life the relationship goes nothing but excellent until a very big steak appears and they all become greedy the three are guilty to return to their usual fights and rivalriesbut still to see tom jerry and spike as friends is truly a delightful and grateful experience even if only for a whileoh by the way as a curious fact two songs from the wizard of oz are played here in instrumental versions: were off to see the wizard and somewhere over the rainbow<SEP>1
not only does this film have one of the great movie titles it sports the third teaming of 70s child actors ike eissenman and kim richards i seem to remember this film being broadcast halloween week back in 78 going against linda blair in stranger in our house i missed it on the first run choosing to see the other film later on repeat i saw i made the right choice the movie is not really bad but really lacks any chills or surprises although i did like the scene where richard crenna shoots the family dog to no avail<SEP>1
_waterdance_ explores a wide variety of aspects of the life of the spinally injured artfully from the petty torments of faulty fluorescent lights flashing overhead to sexuality masculinity and depression the experience of disability is laid openthe diversity of the central characters themselves underscores the complexity of the material examined - joel the writer raymond the black man with a murky past and bloss the racist biker at first these men are united by nothing other than the nature of their injuries but retain their competitive spirit over time shared experience both good and bad brings them together as friends to support one anothermost obvious of the transformations is that experienced by joel who initially distances himself from his fellow patients with sunglasses headphones and curtains as he comes to accept the changes that disablement has made to his life joel discards these props and begins to involve himself in the struggles of the men with whom he shares the wardthe dance referred to in the title is a reference to this daily struggle to keep ones head above water; to give up the dance is to reject life _waterdance_ is a moving and powerful film on many levels and i do not hesitate to recommend it<SEP>1

bette midler is indescribable in this concert she gives her all every time she is on stage whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads bette midler moves her audience if you cant see it live which is the best way to see bette then this is the next best thing an interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power her more vocally correct version of stay with me never loses anything in spirit from the rose or divine madness here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever i will treasure this concert for a very long time<SEP>1

i saw this movie while it was under limited release mainly for the novelty of seeing pierce brosnan with a moustache but it turned out to be one of the funniest movies i have seen all year it starts out almost as a thriller but steadily progresses into a hilarious piece of work full of one-liners and great comedic energy between pierce brosnan and greg kinnear also while i say this movie is a comedy it doesnt forget it has a heart at times and can be very touching when it needs to be when i went into the theater i didnt know what to expect much more than a moustache but what i got was one of the best movies i have seen in a long time leaving the theater i felt very fulfilled from the film and plan to see it again in wide release i recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy with a well-written script and a big moustache<SEP>1
for those of you whove never heard of it or seen it on a&e cracker is a brilliant british tv show about an overweight chain-smoking foulmouthed psychologist named fitz who helps the manchester police department get into the heads of violent criminals its considered to be one of the finest shows ever to come out of england and thats saying something and was tremendously successful in england and around the world back in 1993now the original stars have re-teamed with the original writer to knock out one more 2-hour episode ive loved this show ever since id first seen it over a decade ago the dvd box set holds a place of honor in my collection and i can quote a good deal of fitzs interrogation scenes practically word for word the idea of robbie coltrane reteaming with jimmy mcgovern for another tv movie about fitz filled me with absolute gleeill start with the good one of the many things that impressed me about the original cracker series was how quickly fitz was defined as a character five minutes into the first episode  with his lecture throwing the books into the air his drinking and his cussing of the guy after him on the gambling machine queue  and you knew simply knew who this character was you could feel him clicking in your mind the kind of click that only happens when a great actor gets a great role written by a great writercoltrane of course remained great throughout the show but i always felt that some of the later episodes  those not written by mcgovern  mistreated the characterso the good news is this: fitz is back as soon as you see him in this show  making incredibly inappropriate comments at his daughters wedding  youll feel that click once again its him: petulant one moment and truly sorry the next always insightful sincere to the point of tactlessness but brilliantly funny in the process if you love this character as much as i do youll be delighted with how he is portrayed in the movie and this extends to judith and mark: in fact everything having to do with the fitzs is handled perfectlythe problem i do have with this movie revolves around the crime fitz is trying to solve in standard cracker fashion we know exactly who the criminal is in the first five minutes  the suspense lies in seeing fitz figure it out in this case we have a serial killer who is out for american blood and the reason for this unfortunately is not due to any believable psychological trauma  rather it seems that the murders are here simply to allow the writer to display his personal political beliefsits difficult for me to write this as i truly believe that jimmy mcgovern is one of the greatest writers in the world nor do i have a problem with movies that are about current issues or movies that take a political stand but in the cracker universe we expect to see the characters behaving like human beings not like caricatures instead the americans in this movie are all depicted in an entirely stereotypical fashion theyre know-nothing loudmouths who complain about everything treat the locals like crap and cheat on their wives  one of them even manages to do all of the above within less than 5 minutes i honestly thought id mistakenly switched channels or somethingbut it doesnt stop there we get constant reminders of just how badly the war in iraq is going  reminders that have nothing whatsoever to do with the story and appear practically out of nowhere the killer is so busy ranting about how bush is worse than hitler that he almost forgets to get on with the killing; but more to the point he is such a mouthpiece for the writers political views that he forgets to act like a believable human being and thus we  as an audience  dont buy his sudden transformation from a happy family man to a tortured serial-killing souli cant say that this ruined the show for me  its was still good tv better than almost everything else in the genre mainly due to once again coltrane but its constant politicizing made it impossible for it to be as good as the real cracker classics like to be a somebody  an episode that was just as issuey but one that was handled with far more subtlety and psychological depthtwo other small points: panhandle not being around is a disappointment but whats worse are her replacements the entire police department  which for so long filled with such great characters - is now full of vanilla completely interchangeable cops who lack any and all personality how you could drain couplings richard coyle of personality is beyond me but it is indeed missing herealso there are couple of moments where the show lost its believability for me one such instance revolves around fitz having to narrow down the entire population of manchester from 1 million to a hundred based on some very strange criteria french windows how does the computer know if i have french windows  he not only succeeds in doing this but he succeeds in less than an hour i dont think soso all in all i was a little disappointed its recommended viewing but remember to leave at least some of your expectations at the door still if theres new series to come after this it would all have been for the good: im convinced that mcgovern can still write great stuff and maybe now that hes got his politics out of his system he can go back to writing about people<SEP>0

the notorious bettie page 2005 directed by: mary harron starring: gretchen mol chris bauer lili taylor sarah paulson & david strathairn mpaa rating: r for nudity sexual content and some language it seems as though every celebrity nowadays is getting a biopic made about his or her life from ray charles to johnny cash biopics are very posh right now the notorious bettie page is the latest of these to be released on dvd it features gretchen mol as the worlds most famous pin-up model bettie page and was filmed mostly in black and white with certain excerpts in color unlike ray walk the line and finding neverland however this movie is not going to be one to watch out for at the oscars this year this movie lacks the emotional resonance displayed in other biopics and most of the more dramatic moments in bettie pages life are either completely ignored or only merely suggested this does not mean however that it is a bad movie in fact the notorious bettie page is a thoroughly entertaining and fulfilling movie--a solid work of cinema this film focuses more on pages exciting career and the thin line between sexuality and pornography it is filmed with fervor and care and mary harrons direction captures the look and feel of the time period as most filmmakers only dream abouteveryone knows bettie page played by mol whether you know her as an icon or a simple porn star you know her she is a woman who had a very profound impact on american culture only by revealing more skin than deemed appropriate at that particular time now most people know her as one of americas first sex symbols--a legend to many models especially those of playboy and other adult-oriented magazines she lived in a time when showing just an inch of flesh below the waste could have someone arrested and pages bondage-style photos were just the thing to push the american public into an uproar in fact the photos launched a full-fledged senate investigation about common decency and the difference between harmless films and pornthe performances in the notorious bettie page are absolutely wonderful with gretchen mol standing out her performance as bettie page is simply brilliant i understand that when she was announced for the role many people were skeptical her name is not one that immediately leaps to my mind when i think of great performances now it will she completely aced the role and drew me in with her vulnerable and yet deeply engaging performance david strathairn is fresh off of last years good night and good luck in which he gave one of 2005s best performances here he gives yet another fine performance even though he is slightly underused i was shocked at how very limited his screen time was but quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie the only performance i have seen from lili taylor was that in the haunting 1999 while most people ignored the movie i found it to be an enjoyable if not completely shallow horror movie and i also have always thought that taylor was perfectly credible as the emotionally-distraught nell here taylor gives yet another credible performance she gives a very subdued performance and delivers the perfect performance to compliment that of gretchen molafter everything was said and done i realized that the notorious bettie page cannot be compared to other biopics such as finding neverland and walk the line it is incomparable to these because it tells a story of a woman and her career from the beginning to the end her personal life is briefly implied but it is really her impact on the world that becomes the high point we watch the film knowing that page will eventually bare all and we know the impact that her decisions will have but we are rarely shown the impact that they will have on her personal life she is a woman that never looked back and could constantly reinvent herself after all she was an adult model turned christian missionary this movie does not over dramatize anything it could have included fictitious moments of page sobbing hysterically and begging god to forgive her it could have shown page running and screaming through the rain trying to escape the ghosts of her past and yet it does not the notorious bettie page tells a simple story and that is something rare by todays standards fortunately it is quite refreshingfinal thought: the notorious bettie page is a relaxing movie with absolutely amazing cinematographyoverall rating: 910 a<SEP>1
antitrust could have been a great vehicle for rachael leigh cook but the director cut out her best scenes in the scenes that she are in she is just a zombie she is involved in a sub-plot that is simular to a sub-plot in get carter but she handles the sub-plot better in get carteri blame the director the directors homage to hitchcock was corny its the scene were ryan philippes charactor realizes he may not be able to trust tim robbins charactor at least i think its a homage to hitchcock the dvd shows the scenes that were cut out i think the director should have trust his instincts and not listen to the test audiences<SEP>0
this movie while seemingly based off of a movie of the same title in 1951 released by mgm and starring janet leigh is still a great film danny glover in one of his best performances brings george knox a down on his luck baseball manager with a short temper to life as for this movie being stacked how about adding christopher lloyd his stage experience works and shows through in his performances on screen a wonderful actor joseph gordon-levitt third rock from the sun brenda fricker a charming and well seasoned irish actress tony danza yes even he is good in this film matthew mcconaughey he stole the show in dazed and confused and his role may not be as pivotal in this film but he got exposure adrien brody what i said about matthew mcconaughey goes the same for adrien except the dazed and confused part some great character actors like taylor negron david tony longo messmer jay o sanders ranch wilder neal mcdonough whitt bass and a seasoned veteran in one of his final performances ben johnson hank murphy the owner of the california angels and the rest of the cast does a great job plus a great storyline that is uplifting to pretty much anyone i dont care what recesses of depression youre in i loved this film as a kid and it brings back memories when i watch it today i need this on dvd i recommend it to any parent whos looking for something their kids have not seen and everybody else for that matter<SEP>1
the men in white movie is definitely one of the funniest if not the funniest comedy movies i ever watched! and i watched quite a lot! it is about two garbagemen who become men in white and then stop an invasion from space it is also a parody of lots of classic movies such as men in black star wars or dr strangelove anyone who says that this movie is crappy has something wrong with his head there are tons of funny gags and jokes here and you might actually get injury to your mouth from laughing too hard it happened to me! if you can watch this movie on tv watch it now - you certainly wont regret it!<SEP>1
i cant even believe that this show lasted as long as it did i guess its all part of the dumbing down of america personally like david spade said i liked this show better when it went by its original title - seinfeld what bothers me the most about this show aside from the obvious base sense of humor and general smuttiness is the pretentious way the episodes are titled truly great shows are still funny after many repeated viewings like the one where rob gets accidentally hypnotized on the dick van dyke show or the one where lucy and ethel work at the candy factory in other words its an honor bestowed upon great programs by the viewers that the writers and producers of friends would have the unmitigated hubris to actually title the episodes themselves in such a fashion before anyones even had a chance to even see it a second time speaks to not only the mediocrity and lack of original thinking on the part of said writers but also of the stultified minds of their viewersyou read the comments of some of these people and can only come to the conclusion that they live in a hallmark card-like neverland full of greeting card sentiment the true meaning of friendship i want to be a friend i want to live in manhattan wake up these people are supposed to be working in coffee shops and looking for work as actors but they somehow manage to live in $4000mo apartments get real all i have to say to those amongst us that want to move to manhattan and live the idyllic new york life with your rosses and monicas good luck with all of that that new york doesnt exist for anyone making less than a serious six-figure income but good luck with all of that anyway now shut-up and pass the soma<SEP>0
just finished watching the movie and wanted to give my own opinionand justice to the moviefirst of all to get things straight this movie is not pretending to be anything other than a solid action comedy movie it doesnt aim to revolutionize the movie industry and garner critical acclaims nor does it want to be regarded as one if you really want to enjoy this movie to the fullest i suggest you discard your critical-mindedness and your longing for a good plot because you wont find any in here with that established let us further into the moviei had low expectations for this movie simply because it didnt have a strong plotyes moviegoers i underrated this movie as well but i never expected myself to enjoy this movie that much i even enjoyed this more than the stephen chow flickswhich i find kung fu hustle to be his best effort and wouldve rated it a 9 as well action is tight and epic while comedy chokes on to the right placesspoilers alert i think the action might be unreal but why would i want to watch a serious basketball movie anyways there are a lot other sports moviesdrama that already did it well why create another spoilers endim not even sure why youre reading this go ahead and watch it just remember no thinking - just watch enjoy smile laugh and every once in a while theythe movie industry creates masterpieces such as pulp fiction or the godfather movies and sometimes they create movies which are better off in the pile of dump im not saying kung fu dunk deserves the recognition that the previous examples have then again if were talking about stephen chow-ish comedy this ones a top tenhighly recommended if you love: -no brainer movies with really good action -kung fu -death trance -kung fu and comedy -what the heck watch this youll have a great time910 for you the cast of kung fu dunk ^_^<SEP>1
the filming crew did not have good access to the occupied territories so filming of the israeli side dominated i was struck by the nearly completely opposite points of view of the mothers the israeli mother lost a child who had the possibility of a life of tremendous happiness the palestinian mother lost a child who had only the possibility of a life of privation and despair with such completely different viewpoints any meeting had no real chance of any meeting of the minds the word peace did not have the same meaning to each of them peace to the palestinian was freedom peace to the israeli was security with such an abyss is this sort of film really worth much i finished with the feeling that i had watched pointless propaganda -- both sides were unconvincing<SEP>0
after witnessing his wife linda hoffman engaging in sexual acts with the pool boy the already somewhat unstable dentist dr feinstone corbin bernsen completely snaps which means deep trouble for his patientsthis delightful semi-original and entertaining horror flick from director brian yuzna was a welcome change of pace from the usual horror twaddle that was passed out in the late nineties although the dentist is intended to be a cheesy fun little film yuzna ensures that the movie delivers the shocks and thrills that many more serious movies attempt to dispense despite suffering somewhat from the lack of background on the central characters and thus allowing events that should have been built up to take place over a couple of days the movie is intriguing generally well scripted and well paced which allows the viewer to maintain interest even during the more ludicrous of moments the dentist suffers on occasion from dragging but unlike the much inferior 1998 sequel there are only sporadic uninteresting moments and in general the movie follows itself nicelycorbin bernsen was very convincing in the role of the sadistic deranged and perfectionist dr alan feinstone the way bernsen is able to credibly recite his lines especially with regards to the foulness and immorality of sex particularly fellatio is something short of marvellous while many actors may have trouble portraying a cleanliness obsessed psycho without it coming off as too cheesy or ridiculous bernsen seems to truly fit the personality of the character he attempts to portray and thus makes the film all that more enjoyable had the dentist not been intended to be a fun almost comical horror movie bernsens performance would probably have been much more powerful sadly the rest of the cast including a pre-fame mark ruffalo failed to put in very good performances and although the movie was not really damaged by this stronger performances could have added more credibility to the flickthe dentist is not a horror film that is meant to be taken seriously but is certainly enjoyable particularly i would presume for fans of cheesy horror those who became annoyed at the number of scream 1996 clones from the late nineties may very well find this a refreshing change as i did a seldom dull and generally well paced script as well as some proficient direction helps to make the dentist one of the more pleasurable cheesy horrors from the 1990s on top of this we are presented with some particularly grizly and on the whole realistic scenes of dental torture which should keep most gorehounds happy far from perfect but far from bad as well the dentist is a flick that is easily worth watching at least once my rating for the dentist  6510<SEP>1
a very promising directorial debut for bill paxton a very dark thrillerwho-really-done-it recommended by stephen king this is a strong well-conceived horror tale about a devout but demented man in thurman texas that goes on a murdering spree after getting orders from god to eliminate demons trying to control mankind a couple of plot twists and an eerie finale makes for your moneys worth most of the violence you dont really see but still enough to double up your stomachdirector paxton plays the twisted man to be known as the hand of god killer matthew mcconaughey is equally impressive as the demented mans eldest son that ends up telling this story to a dallas fbi agentpowers boothe boothe as always is solid and flawless suspenseful white knuckler! highly recommended<SEP>1
the fight scenes play like slow-motion jackie chan and the attempts at wit are pathetic worst pun by far: guess what this time i heard you coming the stars are a mismatched pair: brandon lee despite the terrible lines he has to say actually shows traces of charisma and screen charm - things that dolph lundgren is completely free of at least in this movie note to the director: in the future please stay away from any love scenes especially when your main actress wont do any nudity and you have to rely extensively on a body double *12<SEP>0
well basically the movie blows! its blair witch meets sean penns ill conceived fantasy about going to iraq to show the world what the war on terror is really about the script sounds like it was written by 8th grader no offense to 8th graders; the two main actors over-act the entire film; they used the wrong kind of camera and the wrong type of filmnot that i know anything about those things--but it just didnt look like real documentaries ive watched and worst of all christian johnson took a great idea and made it suck it reminded me of the time i tried to draw a picture of my dog and ended up with a really bad stick figure looking thing that looked more like a giant turd id rather watch the blair witch viii than sit through that again<SEP>0
when tradition dictates that an artist must pass his great skills and magic on to an heir the aging and very proud street performer known to all as the king of masks becomes desperate for a young man apprentice to adopt and cultivatehis warmth and humanity tho find him paying a few dollars for a little person displaced by chinas devastating natural disasters in this case massive flooding in the 1930she takes his new 7 year old companion onto his straw houseboat to live with his prized and beautiful monkey general only to discover that the he-child is a she-childhis life is instantly transformed as the love he feels for this little slave girl becomes entwined in the stupifying tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young manthere are many stories inside this onemany people are touched and the culture of china opens itself for our western eye to observe thousands of years of heritage boil down into a teacup of drama and few will leave this dvd behind with a dry eyethe technical transfer itself is not that great as i found the sound levels all over the meter and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie highly recommended :- 910 stars<SEP>1
towards the end of the movie i felt it was too technical i felt like i was in a classroom watching how our navy performs rescues at sea i liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers i guess i should have figured that out before but i never thought about it using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic the acting was pretty good since theyre mostly seasoned professionals but if youre going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen it should be more like a fantasy comical etc everything was taken too seriously at least the movie had felix ungar as pilot with buck rogers the night stalker and dracula also on board the movie was filled with well known faces i understand that hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama but it does hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature thats why i said it should have been more comical my pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about they walk around with drinks setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later just as if theyre in a building or something and acting as if turbulence just doesnt exist also i know its a disaster movie but suspense doesnt have to include a 30 second crash after hitting something anyway the skilled actors and actresses keep this weak script from having been made into a movie that got canned after its first screening i like lee grant but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get decked:<SEP>0
this movie is just so awful so bad that i cant bear to expend anything other than just a few words avoid this movie at all costs it is terriblenone of the details of the crimes are re-enacted correctly lots of slaughterhouse footage weird cuts and edits no continuity to the plot the acting is absolutely the most amateur i have ever seenthis bomb of a movie was obviously made to make some money without any regard to the accuracy of its content the camera work is out of focus at times and always shaky it looks as if it was shot on videoin fact now that theyve got dennis rader with life in prison i wish they would put the guys that made this horrible movie into prison as wellseriously dont even think about watching this one id give it a negative star if i could<SEP>0
i think if they made any money make a complete turd bomb like this one the i need to get into the movie industry i wiped my ass on a piece of toilet paper and made a better script once watch when the guy is running through the tunnel they used the same 30 feet of tunnel over and over and over again and never even changed the location of the stupid hanging lighti think if i get the thrill of meeting the director of this gem of a movie i think i will pick a fight with him and start it by deficating on his loafersi think i need to puke now<SEP>0
a fragment in the life of one of the first female painters to achieve historical renown artemisia tells the true story of a young italian womans impassioned pursuit of artistic expression and the vicissitudes she encounters the film features sumptuous costuming and sets and a good cast and acting however it is muddled in its attempt to depict the esoterics of the art and the time and is uninspired in its representation of the passion of the artist as painted on canvas and explored through her involvements with men a good film for those interested in renaissance painting or period films<SEP>1
nina foch delivers a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun little gothic nail-biter she accepts a position as secretary to a london society dowager played imperiously by dame may witty and her creepy son the effete and bothersome george macready before she knows it she awakens to find herself in a seaside manor shes never seen before where witty and macready are calling her marian and trying to convince the servants and the nearby townspeople that shes macreadys mad wife of course this pair can only be planning dastardly deeds and even though we know julia has to eventually escape her trap director joseph lewis builds real suspense in answering the question of just how shell manage itmy name is julia ross has nothing stylistically to set it apart from any number of films that came out at the same time period but i was surprised by how well it held together despite its shoe-string budget and b-movie pedigree there are quite a few moments that just may have you on the edge of your seat and i found myself really rooting for julia as she caught on to the scheme underfoot and began to outsmart her captors in any other gothic thriller the heroine would have swooned screamed and dithered waiting for her hero to come and save her so i cant tell you how refreshing it was to have the heroine in this film use her brain and figure out how to save herselfwell donegrade: b+<SEP>1
i read somewhere in a fairly panning review that this is something of a live-action mecha anime and i think theyre on the right lines i first watched this movie when i was very young and ive been dying to see it again and when i finally did just recently all the memories came flooding back i dont think this is to be taken too seriously - its just a bit of good old 80s almost-a-tv-movie fun it is set against the backdrop of a fairly dark future although this point isnt stressed too much what i admired most about this movie was that the dialogue didnt sound generic - no clichés no predictable lines - all in all just good fun! maybe time hasnt been kind to this little movie but still i can find appreciation for it in me its by no means perfect but its entertaining and doesnt try to be anything other than that let the nerds and comic-store-guys worry about technicalities - who cares see it for yourself and make your own decision no-one elses opinion matters<SEP>1
from a modern sensibility its sometimes hard to watch older films its annoying to have to watch the stereotypical wallflower librarian have to take off her glasses and become pretty and stupid to win a man especially such a shallow and inconstant man hes obviously a player i wouldnt trust him to stay true to her who doesnt want to settle down who only looks at dumb attractive women and always calls them baby ick! even after she totally changes her appearance and her life for him he only goes to her after hes supposedly rejected by another woman and learns that connie spent all her money renovating a boat for him i wanted her to stand up to him not pathetically chase after him! his sudden conversion within a few minutes was totally unrealistic and did not work for meapart from that subplot i did like the movie how can you not like sailors dancing with each other! you can tell they were from san francisco ;d the rehearsal dance was great watching ginger rogers purposefully fall in and out of the correct steps was great the last dance scene face the music with the beautiful costumes and the art deco set was beautiful and i really enjoyed we saw the sea though they did use it a few too many times as if they realized it was their best song anyway the plot was a bit weak like most musicals imo - and the songs were ok but the dancing was worth watching the film for i wish they could have showed some shots of san francisco since that was were the film was supposedly setits also weird to see such a lighthearted naval film with the knowledge of what hitler was already doing at that time i have to try to suspend all knowledge to submerge myself into a made up fantasy land<SEP>1
yes be my love was mario lanzas skyrocket to fame and still is popular today his voice was strong and steady so powerful in fact that mgm decided to use him in the great caruso lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of caruso having read the book by kostelanitz who wrote a biography of lanza he explains that the constant practise and vocal lessons became the visionary caruso to lanza there is no doubt that lanza did a superb job in the story but the story is not entirely true; blame it on hollywood! i used to practise singing his songs years ago and became pretty good myself until i lost my voice because of emphysemaasthma ten years ago reaching the high note of be my love is not easy; but beautiful!<SEP>1

channel 4 is a channel that allows more naughty stuff than any of the other channels this show was certainly a naughty one the presenter of this sometimes gross adult chat show four-time bafta winning and british comedy award winning also twice nominated graham norton was just the perfect gay host for a good show like this it had one or more famous celebrities in the middle of it they basically had an adult idea which would either gross humiliate or humour the guest but some are not for the faint-hearted they had women playing the recorder with their parts men using their dicks to play a xylophone women weeing upwards in the bath men with or without pants under their kilts and many more gross but hilarious ideas this is just for adults but enjoy it! it won the bafta twice for best entertainment programme or series it won the british comedy awards for best comedy entertainment programme also nominated best comedy talk show it won an emmy for episode #18 and it won the national television awards twice for most popular talk show it was number 52 on the 100 greatest funny moments very good!<SEP>1
i find it very intriguing that lee radziwill jackie kennedys sister and the cousin of these women would encourage the maysles to make big edie and little edie the subject of a film they certainly could be considered the skeletons in the family closet the extra features on the dvd include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women id say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating ie are they nuts or am i missing something this movie is hard to come by netflix does not have it facets does though<SEP>1
updated january 1st 2006parsifal is one of my two favorite wagner operas or music dramas to be more accurate meistersinger is the other though its hard to imagine it as the top of anyones pops the libretto by the composer as usual is a muddle of religion paganism eroticism and possibly even homo-eroticism and its length may make it seem to the audience like hearing paint drywagner being a famous anti-semite klingsor may be one of his surrogate jewish villains naturally entrusted the premiere to an unconverted not for want of rws trying! hermann levi who was his favorite conductor! go figure! kundry a most mixed-up-gal and another likely jewish surrogate is both villainous or benevolent depending on the sceneconsidering that many video versions of parsifal seem on the stodgy side this film of the opera is in comparison a breath of fresh air hans-jürgen syberberg the director has brought considerable imagination to it but its hard to know why he made some of his choices for example: the notorious dual parsifals of each gender! the puppets the death-mask-of-wagner set and various dolls and symbols such as the nazi swastika in one of the traveling scenes if i remember the real engelbert humperdinck wrote the actual music to pad out the scene changes though wagner himself died much too early to be an actual nazi many of his descendants as well as his second wife cosima were at least fellow-travelers including their grandson wolfgang wagner who still runs the bayreuth festival at an advanced age in fact wolfgangs son gottfried wagner in complete opposition to his father has tried to come to terms honestly with his great-grandfathersyberberg too seems politically ambiguous from what ive read in 1977 he made a well-known film on hitler hitler: ein film aus deutschland sometimes called our hitler in english since it lasts all of 8 hours and hasnt been widely distributed most people have not seen it including myselfarmin jordan the conductor of the audio cd on which this film is based plays amfortas sung by wolfgang schöne edith clever yvonne minton plays kundry michael kutter and karin krick play the dual parsifals both sung by reiner goldberg! and robert lloyd and aage haugland both play and sing gurnemanz and klingsorthough the opera takes place over a long period of time and all except kundry have been described as having aged considerably between acts 2 and 3 no one looks a day older by the end of the opera the magic of the grail in this opera the grail is the cup from which jesus drank at the last supper and not mary magdalene as in more recent times an idea i find preposterous!the conducting and singing are all quite serviceable and the dvd seems to have improved the sound if not the picture to a great extent yes i agree that knas approach is superior even on the second stereo version but he is probably superior to all recorded versions on the wholenot a parsifal for all wagnerites but i think it works quite well as a filmed opera<SEP>1
this documentary film is based on incomplete considerations of the evidence in which brian flemming perhaps purposely fails to mention important evidence to the contrary perhaps his most crucial mistake is one of the earliest: his claims concerning the invalidity of pauls testimony about jesus christ disregard key facts like: **the existence of some formulated creeds within pauls letters these creeds suggest that most of the central claims about jesus were already formulated into statements of faith possibly within a few years of christs death and resurrection **the testimonies of the early christians cant just be tossed out as mere fantasy there were indeed many people claiming to be the messiah during that period but only one of them has remained: jesus why because it would have been preposterous for anyone to have actually believed christ was the messiah and go on to die for those beliefs if they knew that he had not been resurrected **even if the gospels are dated more liberally we are still talking about accounts of jesus written within the lifetimes of other eyewitnesses that would have pointed out inaccuracies in these gospels and there is evidence that the gospels were written much earlier what i am saying is that flemmings documentary is an incredibly biased and self-serving piece of work that hodge podges different arguments and evidence to serve his anti-christian view dont be fooled by poor investigation<SEP>0
this is hardly a movie at all but rather a real vaudeville show filmed for the most part in proscenium and starring some of the greatest stage stars of the day singing in the bathtub is an absolutely amazing production number that must be seen-- be sure to wear your shower cap!<SEP>1
one of the things that interested me most about this film is the way the characters and their associated histories are developed on the fly i suppose the writers wanted us to gain interest in the characters by not force feeding their characters the premise of using the art and craft of furniture design and construction was a unique theme andor analogy for what familiessiblings go through in life the complexity of having a twin serve as a surrogate father and even husband added great tension towards making this film emotionally interesting also although the story was not one that the masses might directly relate to ie jewishtwinsfamily business the themes are fairly universal as every family has a black sheep in it that made it very engaging<SEP>1
the film is about sir christopher strong mp--member of parliament--played by colin clive and his affair with the amelia earhart-like character played by katherine hepburn up until they met he had been a very devoted husband but when he met the odd but fascinating hepburn he couldnt help himself and they fell in love you can tell because they stare off into space a lot and talk endlessly about how painful their unrequited love is frankly this is a terribly dated and practically impossible film to watch part of the problem is that in the pre-code days films glamorizing adultery were very common plus even if you accept this morally suspect subject the utter sappiness of the dialog make it sound like a 19th century romance noveland a really bad one at that sticky and with difficult to like characters after all clives wife is a nice lady and did no one any harm make this one a big waste of time about the only interesting aspect of this film is the costume hepburn wears in an early scene where she is dressed in a moth costume! youve gotta see it to believe it--and she looks like one of the bugaloos an obscure but fitting reference<SEP>0
although this is generally a cheesy jungle-adventure movie it does have some highlights - the settings are quite beautiful and the pacing of the adventure is good you wont be bored watching itkeith is as breezy as possible playing the eponymous lead an unabashedly drunk jungle guide shanghaid into escorting rich boy van hoffman and his gorgeous wife shower on a hunting expedition in cannibal country he never takes things seriously shower is there as decoration and keith makes extensive use of her - she doesnt really have to act much shes not the only female to show off her body and the prurient aspects of the film make it about halfway to a ta picturetheres nothing in this film that would draw specific attention to it or away from it produced to be shlock it succeeds without too much fuss a good 2 am cable programmer<SEP>0
this is almost certainly the worst western ive ever seen the story follows a formula that is especially common to westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that familyfriends have been murdered so hero sets out to exact revenge foils the ineffective lawman rescues the kidnapped loving damsel and murders the expert arch-nemesis in a brutal duel this formula has often been successful -- otherwise it wouldnt be a formula -- but gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it youll ever see the scripting is atrociously simple-minded and insulting; it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth maturity and realism the sound is bad; it sometimes looks dubbed the cinematography is lame and the sets are sometimes just facades the acting is pitiful; sure some of the performers could blame the script but others cannot use that excuse i hope i never see chris lybbert in a speaking role ever again; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho and speaking of chris lybbert who plays hopalong check out his duds if you dare to watch this film: he wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like roy rogers than a hard-working down-and-dirty cowboy if you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of hopalong cassidy then get this but if you have more than two neurons watch something else<SEP>0
i agree with one of the other comment writers about good story & good actors but mismatched and i would also say rushed it has been about 24years since i read the book as it was in school but i felt that you would need to know the story of jane eyre when watching this one as bits are left out & therefore it doesnt fully make sense for example jane & mr rochester have hardly spoken & suddenly he is proposing marriage!!! the actors dont have time to let the audience know how their character feels about each thing happening in the storythe actors are good but arent given enough time to do this story justice im sorry to say it but i didnt really enjoy this versionthe 1970 version with susanna york & george c scott would be the jane eyre movie of my preference but you should check out the 1983 bbc mini series version with zelah clarke & timothy dalton in the 2 main roles i love it so much i watch it regularlythere is an abridged version which goes for 225mins or the full version for 330mins<SEP>0
ive watched this movie twice now on dvd and both times it didnt fail to impress me with its unique impartial attitude it seems more like a depiction of reality than most other hollywood fare especially on a topic that is still hotly discussed even though it sticks closely with the southern viewpoint it doesnt fail to question it and in the end the only sentence passed is that the war is lost not matter what and cruelty is a common denominatorwhat really makes this movie outstanding is the refusal to over-dramatize nowadays truly good movies in a nutshell are few and far apart with mainstream fare being enjoyable if you dont have high expectations but terribly commercially spirited i think this movie comes off as a truly good movie without being a masterpiece because it sticks to itself and gives the viewer a chance to watch and analyze it instead of wanting to bombard him with effect and emotion to blot out his intelligence this movie is cool observant and generally light-handed in its judgement which is goodthe story has its flaws especially jewels character comes off doubtfully but then again the situation at the time was so chaotic that for a young widow it might have been only logical to somehow get back into a normal life even by liberally taking each next guy still she doesnt come off as weak in fact i think shes one of the stronger characters shes always in control of the relationships with the men just tagging and i take it very gratefully that shes not a weeping widow i believe in the 19th century death of a loved one was something a lot more normal than now you could die so easily of even minor illnesses and injuries so the prospect of of someone dying while surely causing grief didnt traumatise people like it does now people didnt seem to build shrines about their lost ones like they do now and i like that attitudemy recommendation is for intelligent people to watch this movie if they are in the mood for something different than the usual hollywood fare dont watch if if you want non-stop action or heart-renting emotion<SEP>1
the movie slugs is unique because the titular vermin are actually the good guys in this horrific tale of nature gone awry you see these poor slugs have been mutated through the pollution of evil humans and dont mean to do anything malicious theyre just slugs- slugs with sharp teeth who eat flesh and excrete poison but slugs none the less the real bad guys are the humans who either actively try to destroy our beloved slugs or overreact when they encounter themfor example take the scene where the guy puts on the glove full of slugs they were just hanging out in a comfortable work glove when out of nowhere this giant hand came at them and they reacted instinctively defending themselves and biting the guy now instead of seeking medical attention for his slug bite this guy runs around his greenhouse screaming like an idiot spills some highly volatile chemicals starts a fire knocks a bookcase over on himself and cuts off his own hand- then the fire and volatile chemicals mix and his house explodes how can you blame that on the slugsthis movie paints a portrait of humans that is less than favorable the characters in this movie include the dumb sheriff who hates everybody the drunk hick whos mean to his dog and the lumpy sidekick whose wife is at least forty-five years older than him theres also a set of drunken teensthat get attacked while copulating and we have to see the skinny long-haired freaks genitals meanwhile theres a guy who looks like a demonic leslie neilson who yells you dont have the authority to declare happy birthday! for some reason finally this parade of loathsomeness is rounded out by the guy from the mst3k classic pod people whose face explodes after eating a slug-laces salad another easily avoided fate blamed on the helpful harmless slugshumans are portrayed as greedy stupid racist alcoholic and in one pointless scene as would-be rapists in the movies climactic scene the villainous humans try to burn the slugs who are cowering helplessly in the sewers well since theyre idiots the humans succeed in blowing up the entire town they alone do more damage than the slugs ever did!if you hate humans and i know i do youll appreciate slugs if youre a fan of bad cinema youll also appreciate this crapfest from the director of pieces and pod people theres enough bad acting silly dialog illogical plot twists lame special effects pointless scenes and poor dubbing to hold your attention<SEP>0
frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situations where you end up laughing out loud at exactly the wrong time; and just at the moment you realize you shouldnt be laughing youve already reached the pinnacle of voice resoundness; and as you look around you at the ghostly white faces with their gaping wide-open mouths and glazen eyes you feel a piercing ache beginning in the pit of your stomach and suddenly rushing up your throat and well you get the pointbut for all its unpleasantness and punches in the face frownland really is a remarkable piece of work that after viewing the inarticulate mess of a main character and all his pathetic troubles and mishaps makes you want to scratch your own eyes out and at the same time you feel sickenly sorry for himit would have been a lot easier for me to simply walk out of ronald bronsteins film but for some insane reason i felt an unwavering determination to stay the course and experience all the grainy irritation the film has to offer if someone sets you on fire you typically want to put it out: stop! drop! and roll! but with this film you want to watch the flame slowly engulf your entire body you endure the pain--perhaps out of spite or some unknown masochistic curiosity i cant even begin to attempt to explainunfortunately mainstream cinema will never let this film come to a theater near you but if you get a chance to catch it prepare yourself: bring a doggie bag<SEP>1
care bears movie 2: a new generation isnt at all a bad movie in fact i like it very much yes i admit the dialogue is corny and the story is a bit poorly told at times but darkheart while very very dark is a convincing enough shape shifting villain and hadley kay did a superb job voicing him speaking of the voice acting it was great nothing wrong with it whatsoever the animation is colourful and some of the visuals particularly at the beginning were breathtaking the songs and score are lovely especially growing up and forever young the latter has always been my personal favourite of the two the care bears who i do like are adorable and the human children are well done too and the ending is a real tearjerker all in all harmless kiddie fun 810 bethany cox<SEP>1
question: how do you steal a scene from the expert of expert scene stealers walther mathau in full furious and brilliant grumpy old man mode answer: quietly deadpan and with perfect timing as george burns does herei know nothing of vaudeville but this remains a favourite film the two leads are hilarious the script funny the direction and pacing very fine richard benjamin is very funny as straight man - trying to get at burns through the window etc even the small parts are greatthere are so many funny scenes mathau messing up the commercial burns repeating his answers as if senilea delightenterrrrrr!<SEP>1

i watched this movie once and might watch it again but although jamie foxx is good in the movie i feel they could have used a less funny character as alvin sanders foxxs scenes for instance in the jail when he is confronted by edgar clenteen david morse are too funny david morse again is a wonderful portrayer of a cop his tough yet mostly quiet features are perfect for his role once again morse meets doug hutchinson bristol in the theater morse ends up coming down hard on hutchinson they are both perfect for this scenario in each film i personally love that quality in a film where actors end up in the same situation as a previous film as these two did in the green mile overall it was a pretty good movie<SEP>1
as said before the visual effects are stunning theyre breathtaking i personally use blender and graphics like that are not easy at all but thats all this movie is not only is the plot confusing but the overall conflict is not clear for example in the first scene proog and emo are trying to run away from who knows what the conflict seems to be between man and nature here later when they enter the room of the bottomless pit proog explains that one step out of place and youre dead here theres a more precise conflict between the careless man and nature as the movie progresses its clear that a conflict exists between man and nature but suddenly a conflict exists between man and man when proog out of nowhere murders emo proog immediately changes from being a caring guardian looking after a lost child to being a sick man he betrays us not only is this depressing but we dont care because the conflict between the characters thoughts and actions is not developed its not a story about someone through struggle emerging stronger its depressing and has not point because theres no great truth about the human soul or about the world brought to light like a great drama does in my opinion the movie is severely underdeveloped in all aspects however the graphics are stunning but a movie is so much more than mere eye candy theres no truth no struggle and a bad surprise ending in conclusion an underdeveloped movie without a point but the graphics are good<SEP>0
i enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of china in the 1930s in this beautiful film the story is simple an older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children the faces of the actors are marvelous to see the story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well the operas in the film remind me of farewell my concubine which was more sophisticated and intricate the story here reminds me of a dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel the plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism humanity and history portrayed<SEP>1
this movie is really special its a very beautiful movie which starts with three orphans sho his brother shinji and their friend toshi theyre poor childrens living on the street but one day they succeeded to steal a bag full of money and then their able to live on to buy a house and their life seems to become much better theyre making new friend life-friends but something went wrong and theyre becoming enemies and it all ends up with them killing each otheri was negative about this movie in the beginning because when singers gackt - solo ex-singer in malice mizer hyde - solo singer in larc~en~ciel both very famous in japan and wang lee-hom - taiwanese singer trying to become actors but this isnt like the other singers-going-actors-movies theyre doing a great job and with no earlier experience in movies except for lee-hom who had been in two movies beforethis is absolutely one of my favorite movies maybe thats a little because im a very big fan of hyde but - it was this movie who made me discover himwell gackt playing the main character - the orphan sho was a part of the group who wrote the script and it was he who insisted that hyde should play shos friend the vampire kei at that time they didnt know each other at least not like friends but after the movie they became really good friend and that shows us too that they really worked hard on this movie and that they had good cooperationthe movie have many different feelings running trough the story love hate sadness pain loneliness happiness and so on i think the first hour are the best its so beautiful after that people are dying keis leaving and it all changes so much but still its a great movie its the only movie who has ever made me cry it ends up so sad but still beautifulso if you havent seen this movie you really should because its wonderful but sad you wont regret it ^^<SEP>1
its like hard to like describe just how like exciting it is like to make a relationship like drama like with all the like pornographic scenes thrown like in for like good measure like and to stir up like contro- like -versy and make us more like money and like stuff - ellen the lost quotekissing like on the like mouth and stuff is like the best like artistic endeavor like ever made watching like ellens hairy arms and like chris masturbating was like the height of my years-long movie-viewing experience and stuff but before i like begin like breaking new us-20-something-airhead records with the my likes let me like just briefly list like the high- like -lights of this visual like feast: 1 chris doing the deed with his genitals and not just that: the way the camera guided so elegantly by ellen and patrick rewards the viewer with a full-screen shot of chriss fat white-trash stomach after he finishes the un-catholic deed - that was truly thrilling i can in all honesty say that ive never seen such grace chris you should do more such scenes in your next movies because that is exactly what we needed as a continuation of what that brilliant brilliant man lars von trier and his idiots 95 started a quick w*** and then a hairy fat white belly: what more can any movie-goer ask for! needless to say i can sit all day and watch chris ejaculate in spite of the fact that im straight such poetry in motion such elegance such style no less than total divine inspiration went into filming that sequence - plus a solid amount of zen philosophy even barbra streisand could not get any more spiritual than this2 ellens hairy thick arms the wobbly-camera close-ups so skillfully photographed by our two directors of photography i cant emphasize this enough ellen and patrick often caused confusion regarding the proper identification of the sex in question there were several scenes when we would see a part of a body a leg arm or foot yet it was often a guessing game: does that body-part belong to a man or a woman naturally chris and his fellow artists ellen patrick and whatsername cast themselves on purpose because their bodies were ideal for creating this gender-based confusion it was at times hard to guess whether one is seeing a female or male leg patrick is so very thin and effeminate in his movements so hairless and pristine whereas ellen and the other girl are so very butch what with their thick legs and arms brilliant 3 brilliant - especially the way that neatly ties in with the theme of role reversal between the sexes: so utterly original and mind-blowing ellen behaves like a man wants sex all the time while her ex patrick wants to talk - like a girl spiffing4 ellens search for a leftist mate he must love the simpsons which is quite leftist i am glad that the makers of this movie decided to break the long tradition of offering us intelligent leftists ellen is such a refreshing - and realistic - change the number of likes that she and her liberal friends manage to utter in less than 80 minutes is truly phenomenal 3849 to be exact they have managed to realistically transfer their real-life ineptness onto the big screen with a minimum of effort and i applaud them for that5 the close-ups of toes plenty of stuff here for foot-fetishists which i think is a very liberal highly commendable way of reaching out to sexual minorities after all shoe- and foot- fetishists are offered so little in modern cinema so its nice to see that someone out there careskotm or rather klotlmas offers more than meets the eye it is not just a modest little film about shallow people engaging in hollow relationships while indulging in meaningless conversations no its much more than that its about the light that guides all silly creatures; the guiding light that dominates the futile lives of various pseudo-artistic wannabes who just dropped out of film school and plan to assault our senses with dim-witted drivel that will hopefully play well at pretentious festivals like sundance and cannes enabling them to gain the necessary exposure hence some real cash for a change with which they will later hire the likes of sean penn and george clooney in promoting the saving of this planet and the resolving of all political problems this world faces what better way to do that than by making porn at the very start if chris and ellen did the camera here as is clearly stated in the end-credits then who held the camera while the two of them were in front of it they probably hired some passers-by and shoved the camera into their handsgo to http:rateyourmusiccom~fedor8 and check out my tv & cinema: 150 worst cases of nepotism list<SEP>0
what has ireland ever done to film distributers that they seek to represent the country in such a pejorative way this movie begins like a primer for film students on irish cinematic cliches: unctuous priests spitting before handshakes town square cattle marts cycling by country meadows to the backdrop of anodyne folk music quickly however it becomes apparent that the main theme of the film is the big daddy-o of irish cliches - religous strife it concerns a protestant woman who wants to decide where her catholic-fathered child is educated which would seem like a reasonable enough wish though not to the 50s county wexford villagers she has to live with rather than send them to a catholic school she decides to up and leave for belfast then scotland where a few more cliches are reguritated while shes there her father who looks eerily like george lucas and family back home are subjected to a boycott which turns very nasty im not going to give away the ending not because i think people should go see this movie but because its not very interesting one of the problems with the film is the central character: were supposed to sympathise with her but end up instead urging her to get a life the villagers are presented as bigots whose prejudices should be stood up to but traumatising your kids seems an innappropriate way to go about it in addition it takes on burdens which it staggers igniminiously under when it tries to draw analogies with the current northern ireland peace process: the woman is told by her lawyer that she must lay down preconditions for her return the film is allegedly based on a true story but its themes have been dealt with much more imaginatively and with less recourse to hackneyed cliches in the past<SEP>0
i remember watching the bsg pilot i can describe that night exactly i remember what chair i sat in that show was magic it came alive i enjoyed the first two years of bsg i enjoyed parts of the third year even and i watched every episode of the fourth year totally faithfully in great hopes that it would somehow turn around well it didnti watched the caprica pilot and was enthralled there was hope for something good here then i started watching the regular episodes and they are getting more and more boringits too obvious too predictable it reminds me of the droll political correctness of his last failed show virtualitymuch of his line work on ds9 was good when he focused on bsg in an organized way it was good this was especially true early on when they more or less followed the pattern of episodes set by the first bsg series when they departed from that after meeting up with admiral cain and the pegasus it all went to pot it was like he wrote the rest of the show without knowing where he was goingmaybe it will improve maybe it was just a few weak initial episodes but i am very very nervous<SEP>0
well i have finally caught up with rock n roll high school almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979 latecomer that i am i will probably first see this summers new documentary patti smith: dream of life sometime around 2040! and no the film doesnt feel dated one bit and yes it was worth the wait this is a very high-energy comedy that features loads of great music and some surprising moments it tells the story of riff randell adorably played by pj soles and the battle that she and her fellow students at vince lombardi high wage against their new repressive principal miss togar danny peary in his book cult movies quite accurately describes mary woronovs performance as an evil eve arden a typical teens vs establishment story line is beefed up here with some absurdist humor those exploding mice that giant mouse the hansel and gretel hall monitors and some truly rousing tunes riff is of course the #1 fan of that original punk band the ramones and that band dishes out a bakers dozen of its greatest songs during the course of the film including five at a concert that is a total blast indeed the sight of riff furiously dancing to teenage lobotomy at this blowout may be the pictures funniest moment and the initial appearance of joey johnny dee dee and marky in their ramonesmobile and later slinking down a street singing i just wanna have something to do is quite exhilarating the film ends with an explosive confrontation that is i would imagine every high school kids wet dream fun stuff indeed on a side note the ramones were one of the loudest bands that i have ever seen in concert so i was very amused to note that the dvd for this film comes with optional english subtitles for the hearing impaired how many aging punks out there found these subtitles necessary i wonder<SEP>1
this movie works because it feels so genuine the story is simple and realistic perfectly capturing the joys and anxieties of adolescent love and sexuality that mostall of us experienced during our teen yearsthe actors are as natural as figures in a documentary but are as convincing and as charismatic as seasoned performers the dialogue is fresh and honest and thankfully not filled to the brim with cutesy pop culture references also the cinematography is at once gritty and beautiful bringing the lower east side setting to life in a very tangible wayon an artistic level i love this movie because it reminds me of great italian neo-realism films like the bicycle thief and la strada movies rarely feel as real as this does or as bicycle thief did and the only other movie ive seen that treats teen sexuality with the same level of seriousness is elia kazans splendor in the grass writerdirector peter sollett deserves tremendous praise this film is quite an achievementon a personal level i am always glad to see a movie that treats members of ethnic america with love and respect as an italian-american i hate the way my own people come off in the cinema as racist womanizing criminal geniuses in irritatingly popular epics and my aggravation on this count makes me acutely sensitive to other groups and their awful silver screen representations hispanics and asians in particular seem cursed to playing villains in westerns and action movies good thing gong li didnt try to become famous in america!of course thanks largely to the rise of indie pictures and the influence of miramax we are seeing a few more pictures about ethnic characters here and there but raising victor vargas is easily one of the best while i do really like my big fat greek wedding it is a refreshing change that raising victor vargas is played straight with less exaggerated and broadly-drawn characters while still being very funny in its own right finally! latino characters worthy of note i have a feeling that this is a film that will be rememberedof course now that he has made this wonderful picture about a family from the dominican republic i hope peter sollett gets around to making a movie about italians soon! : - marc dipaolo<SEP>1
this is a typical steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds i wouldnt call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a steele novel knows how they all end if you dont want to know much about the plot dont keep readinggilberts character ophelia is a woman of french decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she otherwise a good actress cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent brad johnson also an excellent actor is matt who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce he is gentle convincing and compelling in this rolethe two meet on the beach through her daughter pip and initially ophelia accuses matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid all of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in lovethe chemistry between the two leads is not great even though the talent of these two people is not in my opinion a question they did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical two people meet tragedy bigger tragedy a secret is revealed another tragedy and then they get together i wish there was more to it than that but there it is in a nutshelli wanted mindless entertainment and i got it with this in regard to the genre of romantic films this one fails to be memorable a secret affair with janine turner is far superior not a steele book as are some of steeles earlier books turned into film<SEP>0

drew barrymore is an actress that has gone through bad periods not only in her career but in her personal life too after being a prodigy child actress she descended into obscurity with mediocre films of low quality while she has recovered from that dark past this movie stays as a reminder of drew barrymores worst daysthe movie starts with an interesting premise very reminiscent to brian de palmas raising cain; with a plot dealing with multiple personality disorder that sets the story for a horrorthriller barrymore stars as holly gooding a young woman who is trying to make a new life in california after a traumatic event of her past in which apparently her other personality killed her mothersuddenly her past returns to haunt her as her evil personality is back in her life willing to ruin her new found peace and her new found love in the middle of the chaos his new boyfriend patrick highsmith george newbern will try to help holly to face the demons of her pastunlike de palmas underrated thriller doppelganger is for the most part a mediocre film that not only never fulfills its purpose it also concludes in one of the worst endings of movie history while barrymore is definitely not at her best she manages to keep her dignity with an above average performance the rest of the cast however range from mediocre to painfully bad over-the-top performances although leslie hope manages to be among the best of themthe script is full of clichés and de palmas influence is quite obvious while the movie tries to be original by making literary references in almost every line the dialogs are dull and the wooden acting certainly doesnt do any good it has a fair share of nudity and for strange reasons and excessive use of special effectsthe make-up effects are done by the outstanding knb and are really among the few good things in the movie however the bizarre over-use of the effects in the totally out of context ending decreases the impact of knbs work and makes cheesy what in a different movie would be amazingthe fact that this is a b-movie is no excuse for its low quality as with a better and more coherent script this could had been an interesting movie sadly all we have here is a mediocre film that gets worse every second worthy for barrymores beauty 310<SEP>0
yes awa wrestling how can anyone forget about this unreal show first they had a very short interviewer named marty oneil who made rock n roll buck zumhofe look like a nose tackle then it was gene okerland who when he got mad as the wrestler would say either were out of time or well be right back acting like he was mad but actually sounding forced after he went to the wwf ken resneck took over even though his mustache looked like week old soup got stuck to it was a very fine interviewer who georgeous jimmy garvin called mouse face which made me fall off my chair laughing after he jumped ship then larry nelson came on board which he was so bad that phyllis george would of been an improvement! then theres doug mcleod the best wrestling announcer ever who made every match exciting with his description of blows! then he was offered more pay by the minnesota north stars hockey team at ringside who can forget roger kent whos mispronouncing of words and sentences were historic like when a wrestler was big hes a big-on! punched or kicked in the guts right in the gussetsor when kicked he punted him or the piledriver should be banned after nick bockwinkle used it on a helpless opponentright roger like you care! after he left to greener moneywwf they had rod trongard whos announcing style was great but different like when a wrestler scraped the sole of his boot across another guys forehead hed sayright across the front-e-lobe or when a wrestler is in trouble hes in a bad bad way he also would say awa the baddesttoughestmeanest most scientific wrestlers are here right in the awa!no extra money verne gagne! after he leftwwf larrywheres phyllis! nelson took over and i would talk to someone else or totally ignore himwwe wisely didnt take him! also greg gagne had the ugliest wrestling boots i ever saw a yellow color of something i dont want to sayalso when hes looking for the tag he looks like he wants to get it over with so that he can run to the nearest restroom! jumpin jim brunzell was such a great dropkick artist that you wonder why greg was ever his partner jerry blackwellripwas also a superstar wrestler but you wonder why verne had himself win against himpuhleeeeze! then when vince mcmahon would hire gagnes jobbers he would make most of them wrestle squash matches i like to see the gagne family say wrestlings real now!<SEP>0
i ran across this movie at the local video store during their yearly sidewalk sale while scanning thousands of videos hoping to find a few cartoon movies for sale i came across this movie i read the back of the movie and knew it was gods hand at work for me to purchase this movie you see i have a sibling group of three foster and soon to be adopted children living with my family immediately my foster children made a connection with the three children starring in the movie the movie helped them better understand their own circumstances for the first time also the oldest of the sibling group 7 year oldfemale decided to open up to me a little bit about her past and the trauma she had experienced she has been fighting the entire trust issue this is also the first time i had seen her cry after watching the film i asked her what it meant for a child to be adopted she replied it means to be happy a must see for families who are fostering children and are considering adoption it certainly opened the lines of communication with us<SEP>1

i saw this movie at the 18th haifa film festival and it is one of the best ive seen this year seeing it on a big screen and i mean big not one of those tv screens most cinemas have with an excellent sound system always enhance the cinematic experience as the movie takes over your eyes and ears and sucks you into the story into the picturethe movie presents a set of characters which are loosely inter-connected their stories cross at certain points and the multiplicity of story lines reminded me very much of the great robert altman and his exquisite films but the true hero of the movie is obviously the city of madrid which provides the backdrop for the entire movie it houses the characters contains the pavements and roads on which they walk and sets the background atmosphere for all the events all in beautifully filmed scenesthe movie returns again and again to certain themes shoes for instance and in essence salazar makes his metaphores more and more understandable to the viewer as the movie progresses he combines the views of the city with the shots of the characters and elegantly matches the feeling of the scene to the background a set of talented actors helps him portrait a wide variety of characters one excellent example is the scene in which juaquin takes anita across the street for the first time it might not work on a small screen but it gave me goose bumps easily on a big screenthe message of the movie is very positive and accordingly the movie is light and funny at times the music along the movie is usually pop with a few instrumental pieces i hope to put my hand on the soundtrack one day although i seriously doubt i willall together i came out of this movie with a sensational feeling and im not easily impressed youll have to take my word for it for this and more i give this movie a solid 810<SEP>1
my father dr gordon warner ret major us marine corps was in guadalcanal and lost his leg to the japanese and also received the navy cross i was pleasantly surprised to learn that my father was the technical adviser of this film and i am hoping that he had an impact on the film in making it resemble how it really was back then as i read in various comments written by the viewers of this film that it seemed like real-life my father is a fanatic of facts and figures and always wanted things to be seen as they were so i would like to believe he had something to do with thathe currently lives in okinawa japan married to my mother for over 40 years ironically shes japanese and a few years ago was awarded one of the highest commendations from the emperor of japan for his contribution and activities of bringing back kendo and iaido to japan since mcarthur banned them after wwiimy father was once a marine but i know that once you are a marine youre always a marine and that is exactly what he is and i love and respect him very muchi would love to be able to watch this film if anyone will have a copy of it and id love to give it to my father for his 94th birthday this year!<SEP>1
today i found they all laughed on vhs on sale in a rental it was a really old and very used vhs i had no information about this movie but i liked the references listed on its cover: the names of peter bogdanovich audrey hepburn john ritter and specially dorothy stratten attracted me the price was very low and i decided to risk and buy it i searched imdb and the user rating of 60 was an excellent reference i looked in mick martin & marsha porter video & dvd guide 2003 and  wow  four stars! so i decided that i could not waste more time and immediately see it indeed i have just finished watching they all laughed and i found it a very boring overrated movie the characters are badly developed and i spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story the plot is supposed to be funny private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing but i have not laughed along the whole story the coincidences in a huge city like new york are ridiculous ben gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man with the women falling for him as if her were a brad pitt antonio banderas or george clooney is quite ridiculous in the end the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the playboy centerfold and playmate of the year dorothy stratten murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie and whose life was showed in star 80 and death of a centerfold: the dorothy stratten story; the amazing beauty of the sexy patti hansen the future mrs keith richards; the always wonderful even being fifty-two years old audrey hepburn; and the song amigo from roberto carlos although i do not like him roberto carlos has been the most popular brazilian singer since the end of the 60s and is called by his fans as the king i will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions manly dorothy stratten my vote is fourtitle brazil: muito riso e muita alegria many laughs and lots of happiness<SEP>0
i am not so much like love sick as i image finally the film express sexual relationship of alex kik sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness frustration and jealous at last alex waked up and realized that they would not have result and futureending up was sadthe director tudor giurgiu was in amc theatre on sunday 12:00pm on 081006 with us watched the movie together after the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of romanian were kind of complicateon my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere i dont feel any particular impression and effect from the movie the love proceeding of alex and kiki and kiki and her brother sandu were kind of next door neighborhood storythe two main reasons i dont like this movie are firstly the film didnt told us how they started to fall in love sounds like after alex moved into the building which kiki was living then two girls are fall in love it doesnt make sense at all how a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man too much fragments you need to image and connect those stories by your mind secondly the whole film didnt have a scene of alex and kiks sexual intercourse that s what i was waiting for however it still had some parts were deserved to recommend the ear piercing part was kind of interesting alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kiks love that was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love also the scene of they were lying in the soccer field the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate<SEP>0
oh its so cool to watch a silent classic once in while! director vidor is simply delightful and even makes a lengthy at least for 1928 cameo as himself the story is about having success in life and the way it changes you marion davies plays a girl that leaves its friends in a little comedy studio to be part of a larger drama studio she becomes a big star and the consequences are she really alienates from the real world for a moment she even denies her poor past! the cameos are simply hilarious certainly the scene where the main character marion davies seesmarion davies in the studios and concludes she doesnt seem that special its got to be one of the first movie-in-the-movies here and for real freaks its awesome to see the cameras and material from way back then a must-see if you ask me!!<SEP>1
*** this contains many many spoilers not that it matters since everything is so patently obvious ***oh my god where do i start well here - this is the first time i have ever come home from a movie and said i have to get on imdb and write a review of this now it is my civic duty such is the badness of this flick *begin digression* but let me just state one thing before i start im not some harvard-art-major-film-noir-weenie in fact i went to the college at the other end of mass ave in cambridge the one where the actual smart people without rich daddies and trust funds go which should put me squarely in the nerd-who-would-obsessively-love-comic-book-films census group and still i hated this film my viewing preference is for the highbrow cinematic oeuvre that includes the die hards bond flicks clerks and the grail i wish the titanic had never sunk not so much for the lives lost but so we wouldnt have been subjected to that dung-heap of a film and the single and only reason i will watch a snooty french art film is if there is a young and frequently disrobed emmanuelle beart in it i even gave maximum overdrive one of its precious few 10s here on imdb for gods sake so im as shallow as they come therefore im not criticizing this film because im looking for some standard of cinematic excellence - its because elektra stinks like a three-week-old dead goat *end digression*ok theres so much badness here that i have to try to categorize it here goes:ms garner: one of the compelling reasons a male would want to see this flick is to see lots of hot jgar i have no idea why my wife wanted to i think that between this and finding nemo the latter was the sexier film you know the red outfit shes advertised wearing in every freaking ad you see you see her in it twice - once at the beginning once at the end bummer in the rest she basically looks like what morrissey would look like if he were a female - lots of pouting and black clothes which brings me to the incredible range of expression jgar shows in her acting - ranging from pouting all the way to pouting and crying oh my god youd think she was being forced to date ben affleck or something horrible like that um waitthe bad guysgal: they show about the same range of expression and acting ability that youd expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit at least next to jgars performance it doesnt stand out too badly one guys role is to stand there and be huge anothers is to stand there and have stuff come out of him and the womans role is to stand there and breathe on andor kiss people they manage to pull these incredible feats off the main bad guy has the most difficult role of all - he has to simultaneously a appear angry and b appear asian he does a fine job at this i think there was a fifth bad guygal but my brain is starting to block parts of this movie out in self-defenseplot twists! this movie has about as many surprises as a speech at the democratic national convention lets just put it this way - my wife who has only been in the us for half a year and speaks only a small amount of english - whispered this to me when the girl first appears in jgs pad and i swear to god i am not making this up: she go to house to kill girl and father too and this is before the father has even appeared on the screen now my wife isnt stupid but she isnt being courted by mensa for her gifts either and shes had zero exposure to daredevil or the comic book genre and she figured this out in 00015 seconds with no prodding and no prior information such is the blatant obviousness of this film rarely-before-seen stupidity! ok so theres this big dude in the film he can take a chestful of shotgun blast and brush off the shot like its lint and he can take a vicious electra stab to the chest and just bend the metal or melt it - or something - more defenses kicking in thank god but jg jumps on his head and he explodes an achilles noggin ok! such is the mind-numbing stupidity of this filmack im starting to feel a cerebral hemorrhage coming on so i have to stop but you have been warned if you have to intentionally slash your own tires to prevent yourself from going to see this movie do it and if armageddon is going to come please let it be >before< this comes out on dvd<SEP>0

i was lucky enough to get a free pass to an advance screening of scoop last night full house at the theatre and when the movie ended there was spontaneous applause i didnt speak to anyone who disliked scoop although two teenagers sitting next to me sighed and fidgeted uncomfortably for most of the film they were the exception though because everyone else including myself really enjoyed themselvesscoop is a quickly paced murder mystery a young female journalism student is unwittingly maneuvered by forces beyond her control into trying to catch a serial killer on the loose plenty of hijinks ensue as she partners up with a traveling illusionist and falls in love with a frisky and charming young noblemanscoop isnt a bad addition to the woody allen filmography it isnt his best work but it is a very enjoyable and light hearted romp id say it fits quite comfortably into being an average woody allen film right in the middle of the pack if youre a woody allen fan youll probably enjoy yourself if youre indifferent to his work then scoop might be enough to get you interested in seeing more i dont think that anyone who dislikes his style of film-making and acting are going to change their mind woody plays the same kind of neurotic character weve grown so accustomed to although it borders dangerously close to forced and over the top in this film while potentially aggravating for some who might find themselves wishing hed hurry up and just spit out the words woody allen fans know what to expectvery good performances all around in my opinion although i found myself missing ian mcshane who is excellent and not on camera nearly enough hugh jackman is great as the charming nobleman and i think woody allen has found a new regular star to work with in scarlett johansson i think that with match point this is their second pairing and shes just magic with the material that woody gives her could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship! im glad i saw the movie and definitely recommend it more sophisticated comedy than movies like scary movie 4 so if your brand of comedy is the latter rather than the former scoop probably isnt for you if on the other hand you like a touch of class sophistication and fun scoop is for you probably not the woody allen film id introduce to a newcomer but all others should give it a try<SEP>1
joan fontaine stars as the villain in this victorian era film she convincingly plays the married woman who has a lover on the side and also sets her sights on a wealthy man miles rushworth who is played by herbert marshall mr marshall is quite good as miles miss fontaine acted her part to perfection--she was at the same time cunning calculating innocent looking frightened and charming it takes an actress with extraordinary talent to pull that off joan fontaine looked absolutely gorgeous in the elegant costumes by travis banton also in the film is joans mother lillian fontaine as lady flora i highly recommend this film<SEP>1
saw this movie on its release and have treasured it since what a wonderful group of actors i always find the casting one of the most interesting aspects of a film really enjoyed seeing dramatic actress jacqueline bisset in this role and wallace shawn is always a hoot the script is smart sly and tongue-in-cheek poking fun at almost everything beverley hills loved paul bartels doctor and ray sharkeys manservant this was raunchy and crude but thank god! unless youre a prude i heartily recommend this movie fyi for anyone who likes to play six degrees of kevin bacon mary woronov & paul bartel were in rock & roll high school mary woronov and robert beltran were in night of the comet together they were all three in eating raoul<SEP>1
as long as theres been 3d technology 1950s i think theres been animation made for it i remember specifically a donald duck cartoon with chip and dale in it i dont remember the name at the moment but the plot was that donald worked at a circus was feeding an elephant peanuts and chip and dale were stealing the peanuts this was made to watch in 3d probably 1960s if you happened to watch meet the robinsons in 3d in theaters they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of its origin there are probably somewhere around 100 cartoons made specifically to be viewed through 3d glasses this claim was a bad move because its not difficult to prove them wrong on top of that this just looks like a bad movie<SEP>0
welcome to collinwood is one of the most delightful films i have ever seen a superb ensemble cast tight editing and wonderful direction a caper movie that doesnt get bogged down in the standard tricksnot much can be said about this film without spoiling it the tag line says it all - 5 guys 1 safe no brainswilliam h macy and sam rockwell lead an amazing cast george clooney should be congratulated for producing this gem<SEP>1
ive seen this movie after watching paltrows version ive found that one a very good one and i thought this would not be as good but i was wrong: british version was far better and enjoyable! i found jeremy northam more agreeable than mark strong but i can say that strong catches much better austens knightley anyway both versions are goodbut anyone that loved austens books should watch this movie i agree with *caalling*: andrew davies changed a few things but still remains faithful to the original10 out of 10my 2 cents!<SEP>1
i almost never comment on movies but i saw the 5 glowing reviews of this movie and decided i had to weigh in with my own review an instructor of mine received this film in the mail mixed in with his academy screeners ampas aka the guys who vote on the oscars and was so floored with how terribly constructed this movie was that he brought it in to our class to demonstrate to us how not to put together a moviethis film has no plot the scenes are horribly horribly edited oftentimes using faux 24 style picture-in-picture techniques and the performances particularly the lead who even fails at acting like a bad actress are for the most part obnoxious someone truly failed to understand the point of an introduction namely the setting up of the plot there is no setup! halfway through the movie neither myself nor the rest of the class knew what this movie was supposed to be about the opening crane shot which sets up some kind of murder is never addressed and now that i think about it was possibly meant to be a flash-forward with the rest of the film being a flashback but it cuts from that scene directly to the next without any indication as suchbah i could really go on and on at the very least this movie gives me renewed confidence in my own film-making ability<SEP>0
i was about 11 years old i found out i live 048 miles from the uncle house the uncle house is on westway dr deer park tx they have added homes since the movie was made i dont know the house number but you can go look it up i am now 21 and i enjoy watching this movie the bar on spencer is no longer their pasadena isd wants to build a school their i drove by the house last week the house still looks great my dad and uncle would go to the street where the house is and watch the actors come in and out of the house trying to make the movie where john cross over the railroad cracks they have made 225 higher when i hear about john loesing his son i start thinking about when he made urban cowboy he was 26 or 25 at the time<SEP>1
an american woman her european husband and children return to her mothers home in watch on the rhine a 1943 film based on the play by lillian hellman and starring paul lukas whom i believe is repeating his stage role here bette davis lucile watson george coulouris geraldine fitzgerald and donald woods an anti-fascist a worker in the underground movement many times injured and wanted by the nazis kurt muller lukas is in need of a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy mother-in-law but he finds out that there is truly no escape as one of the houseguests coulouris is suspicious as to his true identity and more than willing to sell him outgreat performances abound in this film written very much to put forth lillian hellmans liberal point of view it was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released as the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries reach into safe american homes the movies big controversy today is that paul lukas won an oscar over humphrey bogart in casablanca humphrey bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous rick but lukas is transcendent as kurt the monologue he has about the need to kill is gut-wrenching just to mention one scenethough this isnt what one thinks of as a bette davis movie she gives a masterful performance here as kurts loyal and loving wife sara her acting tugs at the heart and the love scenes between kurt and sara are beautiful and tenderthe last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions lillian hellman is not everyones cup of tea but unlike the little foxes she has written some truly sympathetic wonderful characters and a fine story given a casting and production values by warner brothers highly recommended<SEP>1
this movie was excellent i was not expecting it to live up to all the hype but it did like all the bourne movies the action is fast paced realistic and intense if you liked the other two movies in the trilogy you will love this one also the movies plot is straightforward and there are no plot twists that are too unrealistic ok julia stiles character showing up in the italian safe house was kind of far-fetched especially after what happened in supremacy but it makes sense that she is the only character in treadstone that bourne knows that does not want him dead and he could possibly trust and the only person to lead him in the right direction the action is driven by characters and their reactions to what is happening all around them the thing that i always loved about the bourne movies is that bourne can kick butt but when matched with people as good as he is the fights are struggles and he takes a lot of damage in them they never treat the audience like idiotsall the actors were solid in their performances i believe that damon could play bourne in his sleep and receives excellent support from joan allen reprising her role from supremacy david strathairn and scott glenn i recommend this film and the trilogy i do miss franka potente though<SEP>1
premingers adaptation of g b shaws saint joanscreenplay by graham greene received one of the worst critical reactions in its day it was vilified by the pseudo-elite the purists and the audiences was unresponsive to a film that lacked the piety and glamour expected of a historical pageant as in peeping tom the reaction was malicious and unjustified premingers adaptation of shaws intellectual exploration of the effects and actions surrounding joan of archer actual name in her own language is jeanne darc but this film is in english is totally faithful to the spirit of the original play not only on the literal emotional level but formally too his film is a brechtian examination of the functioning of institutions the division within and without of various factions all wanting to seize power as such we are not allowed to identify on an emotional level with any of the characters including joan herselfas played by jean sebergwhose subsequent life offers a eerie parallel to her role here she is presented as an innocent a figure of purity whose very actions and presence reveals the corruption and emptiness in everyone as such seberg plays her as both saint and madwoman her own lack of experience as an actress when she made this filmwhich does show up in spots conveys the freshness and youth of jeanne revealing both the fact that jeanne la pucelle is a humble illiterate peasant girl who strode out to protect her village and her natural intelligence by no means did she deserve the harsh criticism that she got on the films first release its a performance far beyond the ken and call of any first-time actress with no prior acting experience shaw and preminger took a secular view towards joan seeing her as a medieval era feminist not content with being a rustic daughter whos fate is to be married away or a whore picked up by soldiers to and away from battlefields her faith her voices her visions which she intermingles with words such as imagination and common sense leads her to wear the armour of her fellow soldiers to lead them to battle to chase the invading englishman out of franceand yet it can be said that the film is more interested in the court of the dauphinrichard widmark the office of the clergy who try joan led by pierre cauchonanton walbrook impeccably cast and the actions of the earl of warwickjohn gielgud then in joan herself the superb ensemble castall male portray figures of scheming machievellianalthough the story precedes niccolo opportunists who treat religion as a childish toy to be used and manipulated for their own ends the sharp sardonic dialogue gives the actors great fun to let loose john gielgud as the eminently rational earl whose intelligencealbeit accompanied by corruption allows him to calculate the precise manner in which he can ensure joan gets burnt at the stake and anton walbrooks pierre cauchon brings a three dimensional portrait to this intelligent theologian who will give joan the fair trial that will certainly find her guilty richard widmark as the dauphin is a real revelation as against-type a casting choice youll ever find widmark portrays the weak future ruler of france in a frenzied comic caricature thats as close as this film comes to comic relief a comic performance that feels like an imitation of jerry lewis far more than an impetuous future ruler of francepreminger shot saint joan in black and white the cinematographer is georges perinal who worked with rene clair and who did the life and death of colonel blimp in colour its perfectly restrained to emphasize the rational intellectual atmosphere for this film premingers preference for tracking shots of long uninterrupted takes is key to the effectiveness of the film theres no sense of a wasted movement anywhere in his mise-en-sceneit also marks the direction of premingers most matureand most neglected period his focus is on the conflict between individuals and the institutions in which they work how the institution function and how the individual acts as per his principles these themes get their most direct treatment in his film and as always he keeps things unpredictable and finds no black and white answers this is one of his very best and most effective films<SEP>1
this movie resonated with me on two levels as a kid i was evacuated from london and planted on unwilling hosts in a country village while i escaped the bombing and had experiences which produced treasured memories for example hearing a nightingale sing one dark night for the very first time and enjoying a life i never could have had in london i missed my family and worried about them tom is an old man whose wife and child have both died and who lives alone in a small country villageas an old man who is now without a wife whose kids have gotten married and live far away in another province i am again sometime lonely the boys mother is a religious fanatic with very odd ideas of raising a child since a deep affection has grown between old tom oakley and this young lad tom goes in search of him and finally rescues him from very odd and dangerous circumstances at the end of the story there is great tension since due to some bureaucratic ruling it seems that the child is going to lose someone who has developed a loving relationship with him<SEP>1

some moron who read or saw some reference to angels coming to earth decided to disregard what hed heard about the offspring of humans and angels being larger than normal humans reinventing them as mythical giants that were 40 feet tall is beyond ridiculous there was some historical references to housing and furniture in parts of the world that were much larger than would be needed for standard humans these were supposedly built on a scale that would lend itself to a 10 to 14 foot human somewhat supporting the david and goliath tale from the bible there is no mention in any historical references to buildings or artifacts that would support the idea of a 40 foot tall being if i was rating this movie on my own scale it would have been a negative value instead of a one<SEP>0
the last of the blond bombshells is an entertaining bit of fluff judy dench plays elizabeth a newly widowed woman at loose ends she has spent most of her life being the dutiful wife and mother but has never been truly happyshortly after her husbands funeral elizabeth is having her regular lunch date with her stick-in-the-mud children when she spots a street performer this sparks memories of when she was a member of an all girl swing band in london during world war ii we soon learn that the band was not exactly all girl as the drummer was a man dressing as a woman ala some like it hotelizabeth pulls out her sax which she has been secretly practicing throughout her marriage and joins forces with the guitar-playing street musician elizabeth is far more talented than the guitarist and the money begins to flow in she doesnt take any money as she is wealthy and doesnt need it her playing is strictly for artistic fulfillmentelizabeth is seen one day by patrick ian holm who was the drummer-in-drag of the band it seems that patrick was - and still is - quite the ladies man and elizabeth - being only fifteen at the time - was the only band member who did not experience patricks talents other than drummingelizabeth is inspired by her granddaughter to get the old group together once again to play for the granddaughters school dance thus begins a delightful trip down memory lane combined with aspects of a humorous road trip movie - all topped off with some really good swing and bluesi guess im at the age in which i really enjoy older actresses doing their stuff and this film is a treasure trove as it not only stars judi dench but she is supported by none less than olympia dukakis leslie caron and a host of seasoned british character actresses this is all topped off by the extraordinary voice of cleo laineyes it is fluff but totally delightful and exceedingly entertaining fluff<SEP>1
wow my first review of this movie was so negative that it was not excepted i will try to tone this one down lets be real!!! no one wants to see a chuck norris movie where he is not the main characterthere was a good fight scene at the end but the rest of the movie stank i have to wonder if old chuck just cant hang with the best any more has he slowed down so much that he has to turn out junk like this and hope that his reputation will carry him through the entire movie chuck is an awesome martial artist and as we have seen from walker texas ranger a fairly good actor but the trick is to combine both of these qualities in his movies and this one does not very disappointing for us norris fans chuck stay as the main character in your movies because this does not work for yougary<SEP>0
although some may call it a cuban cinema paradiso the movie is closer to a how green was my valley a memory film mourning for a lost innocence the film smartly avoids falling into a political trap of taking sides pro-castro anti-castro focusing instead in the human frailty of the characters and the importance of family filled with good acting in particular from mexican actress diana bracho who plays keitels wife a masterpiece filled with references to classic movies from casablanca to chaplins city lights gael garcia bernal plays a small role which is critical for the dramatic payoff of the story tv director georg stanford brown in a rare return to acting remember the rookies plays a homeless bum who acts as greek chorus superbly it is a pity that this movie originally titled dreaming of julia has been released in the states by thinkfilm with the atrocious title of cuban blood which has nothing to do with the movie<SEP>1
el mar is a tough stark utterly brilliant brave work of cinematic art director agustí villaronga with an adaptation by antoni aloy and biel mesquida of blai bonets novel has created a film that traces the profound effects of war on the minds of children and how that exposure wrecks havoc on adult lives and though the focus is on wars heinous tattoo on children the transference to like effects on soldiers and citizens of adult age is clear this film becomes one of the finest anti-war documents without resorting to pamphleteering: the end result has far greater impact because of its inherent story following childrens march toward adulthooda small group of children are shown in the spanish civil war of spain threatened with blackouts and invasive nighttime slaughtering of citizens ramala nilo mur tur david lozano julia sergi moreno and francisca victoria verger witness the terror of the assassination of men and the revenge that drives one of them to murder and suicide these wide-eyed children become adults carrying all of the psychic disease and trauma repressed in their mindswe then encounter the three who survive into adulthood where they are all confined to a tuberculosis sanitarium ramala roger casamajor has survived as a male prostitute protected by his john morell juli mira and has kept his life style private tur bruno bergonzini has become a frail sexually repressed gay male whose cover is his commitment to catholicism and the blur of delusional self-mutilationcrucifixion francisca antònia torrens has become a nun and serves the patients in the sanitarium the three are re-joined by their environment in the sanitarium and slowly each reveals the scars of their childhood experiences with war tur longs for ramalas love ramala longs to be free from his morell and francisca must face her own internal needs covered by her white nuns habitthe setting of the sanitarium provides a graphic plane where the thin thread between life and death between lust and love and between devotion and destruction is played out to detail more would destroy the impact of the film on the individual viewer but suffice it to say that graphic sex and full nudity are involved in some of the most stunningly raw footage yet captured on film and the viewer should be prepared to witness every form of brutality imaginable for this viewer these scenes are of utmost importance and director villaronga is to be applauded for his perseverance and bravery in making this story so intense the actors both as children and as adults are splendid: roger cassamoor bruno bergonzini and antònia torrens are especially fine in inordinately difficult roles the cinematography by jaime peracaula and the haunting musical score by javier navarrete serve the directors vision a tough film this but one highly recommended to those who are unafraid to face the horrors of war and its aftermath in spanish with english subtitlesgrady harp<SEP>1
well you take oj simpson as a all american soldier turned all american bus driver who decides to rescue his passengers on his own just incase no one else is going to and arte johnson in an absolutely straight role as the tour guide who doesnt know what to do but doesnt want to admit they are in trouble and combine it with lorenzo lamas as one of three baby faced bad boys who intend to kidnap an heiress and leave a busload of people to die on the dessert and you have got to have action plot twists and a lot of drama everyone was good but seeing lamas as the baddest of the bad boys really blew my mind he was much too believable as the overbearing bad guy who not only wanted to kidnap the heiress but rape the women and humiliate the guy who tried to stop him this was evidently long before he cultivated his good guy image and believe me a 20 year old lorenzo in tight jeans you really dont want to miss!<SEP>1
christopher lambert is annoying and disappointing in his portrayal as gideon this movie could have been a classic had lambert performed as well as tom hanks in forrest gump or dustin hoffman as raymond babbitt in rain man or sean penn as sam dawson in i am samtoo bad because the story line is meaningful to us in life the supporting performances by charlton heston carroll oconnor shirley jones mike connors and shelley winters were excelent 3 of 10<SEP>0
i went to see this movie with the most positive expectations i had seen jacquets previous movie march of the penguins and had heard a very positive review of this one on the radio however i was severely disappointed most of all this movie is terribly boring literally nothing happens i tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend and we both ended up laughing because i could only stammer things like well then the winter comes and then spring and then theres an eagle and a river and one time it is dark and the girl goes into a cave and another time the fox has babies and so on after about half an hour i began sighing yawning rolling my eyes cursing the reviewer at the radio station and hoping that it would be over soon but the movie went on and on when it finally ended i had sunken so deep into my chair that i must have looked somewhat similar to stephen hawking the most annoying parts of the movie are a the girl who is obviously there to give children someone to identify with she wears the same clothes throughout the entire movie one year and shows exactly two facial expressions: joy and seriousness she is cute no question about that however a movie about the beauty of nature like this one would have done better without her all-too-human presence i found myself constantly hoping that she might get eaten by a bear drown in the river or something similarly terrible b the commentary by the girls adult voice which tells us nothing but negligible obvious boring redundant things c the music which is desperately lacking subtlety when the girl is happily jumping around the music jumps around too when the fox is threatened by an eagle the music becomes threatening too it reminded me of the very early days of film-making and was just too predictable to enjoy admittedly many of the children who saw the movie with me did obviously like it at least they got somehow involved thus my warning concerns adults only: if you are over ten years old avoid this movie you can get a better and cheaper sleep in most other places<SEP>0
manhattan apartment dwellers have to put up with all kinds of inconveniences the worst one is the lack of closet space! some people who eat out all the time use their ranges and dishwashers as storage places because the closets are already full!melvin frank and norman panama a great comedy writing team from that era saw the potential in eric hodgins novel whose hero jim blandings cant stand the cramped apartment where he and his wife muriel and two daughters must sharejim blandings a madison ave executive has had it! when he sees an ad for connecticut living he decides to take a look obviously a first time owner jim is duped by the real estate man into buying the dilapidated house he is taken to inspect by an unscrupulous agent this is only the beginning of his problemswhatever could be wrong goes wrong the architect is asked to come out with a plan that doesnt work for the new house after the original one is razed as one problem leads to another more money is necessary and whatever was going to be the original cost ends up in an inflated price that jim could not really affordthe film is fun because of the three principals in it cary grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and makes the most out of jim blandings myrna loy was a delightful actress who was always effective playing opposite mr grant the third character bill cole an old boyfriend of myrna turned lawyer for the blandings is suave and debonair the way melvin douglas portrayed him one of the blandings girls joan is played by sharyn moffett who bore an uncanny resemblance to eva marie saint the great louise beavers plays gussie but doesnt have much to dothe film is lovingly photographed by james wong howe who clearly knew what to do to make this film appear much better the direction of hc potter is light and he succeeded in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies<SEP>1
it is considered fashion to highlight every social evil as a result of patriarchy and male dominance however moronic this illogical logic may be however within the story and theme of the film there is no grey area and the woman who should be called the films antagonist is the villain of the story under no circumstances can what she did be justified sexuality of women is just hype in this case and has nothing to do with the actuality it is betrayal of the ultimate sort the man ended up spending his resources and time in the wasteful raising of another mans offspring to top it all the most feeble of arguments raised by the 3 liberated female characters in the climax is pathetic a womans sexual needs are no excuse for her to commit adultery and continually betray her husband and worse there are no other children so in essence his life has been wasted in some societies where justice still prevails such situations result in the execution of the unjust<SEP>0
judaai was a bold film by raj kanwar at its time in 1997 when such a topic was damn out of the boxto give him his credit he does succeed in showing how greed changes a person and to what extent the person can go to get what she wantsthe film however is damn melodramatic many places ridiculousone wonders why anil doesnt buy a tv for his wife when he earns so much just to show how poor he isthe twist is well handled but the handling is straight out of 80s the johny- paresh comedy which entertains here and there stands out as a sore thumb as it doesnt fit in the storyeven there are several cringeworthy scenesdirection by raj kanwar is adequate though at times too melodramatic music is okay but most songs look forcedanil does his part well sridevi is excellent in her part urmila is decent amongst rest kader khan is as usual johny lever is funny paresh irritates farida is decent<SEP>0
with the exception of the sound none of the above are really criticisms for this type of no budget truly independent horror film make up effects and gore are very good and the lead actor was effective the lead actress although attractive needs some coaching as she was particularly poorthe major problem with frightworld is its length at 108 minutes its half an hour too long to be effective as a slasher movie plot wise only about ten minute of the first fifty are relevantin places it is visually engaging and sometimes the lack of lighting works in the films favour however when this is combined with the poor sound as is the case with most of the film large sections are difficult to watchthis could certainly be an entertaining if unoriginal serial killer back from the dead movie with some judicious and ruthless editing in its current form it plays like an unfinished rough cut<SEP>0
mother night is one of my favorite novels and going to see this i was expecting a huge disappointment instead i got a film that perfectly portrays the irony humor elequence and above all else the crushing sadness of vonneguts novelthis is certainly noltes best preformance to date he captures the defeat and selfloathing of howard cambell jr consistently from the subtle intonations of his speech to the held back tears behind his eyesalan arkin is absolutly hilarious as george kraft sherryl lee is haunting in her detachment from reality as cambells young lover john goodman is understated and more than effective as cambells blue fairy godmotherthis pinnocioesque story of cambell trying to be his own ideal hero and unwittingly becoming his ideal tragic villian is a mature and vivid look into what we are as people and aside from that it is one of the most deeply romantic films i have ever come across cambell is the incarnation of both foolish and wise love and at the films sastifyingly painful conclusion he finally learns what it means to be a real boy as his blue fairy godmother grants him his wish and he realizes thatwell watch the movie and youll seemother night is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films ever made it is a beautiful poetic story that digs deep within our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author<SEP>1
the comedic might of pryor and gleason couldnt save this dog from the tissue-thin plot weak script dismal acting and laughable continuity in editing this mess together it has a very few memorable moments but the well dries up quickly as a kid i remember this as a luke-warm vehicle for the two actor-comedians but there was always something strange about the flow and feeling of what was being conveyed in each scene and how this ties to the plot overall watching it again after many years it screams schlock-a-mania im not so concerned with the racial controversy as i wouldnt mind seeing a movie take that issue on with a little levity the most obvious fault to me is that the scenes are laid out like a jumbled non-related series of 2 minute situation comedy bits any not very good ones at that that were stapled together by the editor after an all-nighter at the local watering hole characters change feelings and motivations on a dime without rhyme nor reason between scenes and within scenes making this feel as though no one had any idea of what to get out of the screenplay not that it was any gem to start with i feel bad for the two actors whose legacy is marred by this disaster that should never have been made maybe my sense of humor has become too refined<SEP>0
forgive me for stating the obvious but some films are good and some films are bad of course there are extremes within those two broad categories films such as the godfather saving private ryan and star wars slot comfortably into the good category at the other end of the spectrum there are those films that simply dont deserve to be mentioned by name occasionally however someone produces a truly woeful film a film that should be singled out as a demonstration of how awful a film can be a film that is more than bad such a film is maiden voyagebriefly maiden voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship that is hijacked by a gang of evil criminals who demand a ransom from an equally evil scheming ships owner of course there is an all american hero on board complete with chiselled jaw and sculptured chest who saves the daythis is a production that plumbs new depths everything about it is bad the acting the direction and the so-called plot are breath-takingly poor in short it is an insult to the intelligence of any unfortunate viewer even an american viewer would be annoyed by its shortcomingsyes its that badi will resist the temptation to compose a list of things that angered me about this film however its dumber-than-dumb conclusion should serve as an adequate example of what i meanimagine in your mind that you are an evil hijacker and you are stood in an open lifeboat on a calm sea you are in company with the hero who holds a ticking bomb said hero throws the bomb to you and dives overboard what would you do i dont know about you but i would throw the bomb as far as i possibly could into the sea not this guy he watches as our hero swims away and then he tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate for him results enough said such a demise would merit a mention in the darwin awards website and might also be a suitably apt conclusion to the production teams lives<SEP>0
i really liked this movieit was cute i enjoyed it but if you didnt that is your fault emma roberts played a good nancy drew even though she isnt quite like the books the old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times but she looks good on them to me the rich girls didnt have outfits that made them look rich i mean it looks like they got all the clothes -blindfolded- at a garage sale and just decided to put it on all together all of the outfits were tacky especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits i do not want to make the movie look bad because it definitely wasnt! just go to the theater and watch it!!! you will enjoy it!<SEP>1
i was looking forward to seeing john carpenters episode in season 2 because his first cigarette burns was by far the best from season 1 and i did like other episodes from that season oh how i was disappointedin fairness to carpenter i think the primary problem with this episode was absolutely horrible writing the characters aside from the subject matter seemed to behave and speak as though they were written for an episode of walker texas ranger the acting was bad and i normally like ron perlman a lot but i can only blame them so much because the writing was so horrible im not going to try to guess what the writers were trying to do because that would be useless but it appeared as though they were trying to mix horror obviously with some form of social commentary on abortion and religion in this case not surprisingly it seemed a chance to bash a certain variety or religious nuts as well as fanatical anti-abortionists and i am in favor of both aims but it was done so horribly that i was embarrassed to watch characters act and speak with such stupid inconsistency this failed totally to offer any worthwhile opinion on the subjects and the horror element failed as well alongside such inept writingwhile i dont think carpenter can be blamed for most of the badness here i will say he did choose to direct the teleplay and therefore has that to be held responsible for there are a couple small bits that i found nice hence the 2 stars i gave itthe actual gore and monster effects were good but the cgi gore two separate gunshots to the head were so obviously inferior quality cgi they shouldve never been given the ok im generally very critical of cgi but not because i have a problem with it in principle i have a problem with the execution of it the technology while amazing in some respects is not good enough to match real effects whether they be miniatures or gore especially when it is supposed to match something organic andor alive and therefore shouldnt be used until they are cgi can be used well in small amounts or obviously if the whole film is animatedill also take this opportunity to note that the show title masters of horror is a bad title to have there simply arent many actual masters of horror around maybe two or three if the show were called tale of horror or something like that it would be fine but as it stands the criteria for directing one of these episodes and therefore being criticized for not being a master of horror is that they have directly at least one horror film in their career and it didnt even have to be a good one<SEP>0
cut tries to be like most post-scream slashers tried to be a spoof of the horror genre that tried to be clever by referencing other famous horror movies now i am not bagging scream as i think scream is a very good horror movie that does a great job of blending horror and comedy cut fails on most levels it has its moments but overall it just does not work out not even as a so bad its good movie just a below average onethe first five minutes or so are ok and set the story fairly well apart from the fact that kylie minogue cant really act and ironically she gets her tongue out go figure go forward some time and a group of film students want to finish her film off which is apparently cursed and as you have probably predicted one by one the cast and crew are slowly picked off by a masked madmanunoriginal plot poor acting and a predictable ending are a few of the elements that follow there is plenty of referencing in the film everything from scream to the texas chain saw massacre this isnt smart either it feels as though the director wanted to feel smart and cool by mentioning other famous horror flicks ala scream for a slasher there is minimal gore and no nudity which is a huge negative when it comes to a slasher that has not got a whole lot going for it really i should be supporting this movie because im australian and were not as good when it comes to horror we do have our gems though but cut is definitely not one of themhowever it did keep me watching for the 90 minutes or so so that is something good at least i would not recommend this to anyone apart from hardcore slasher fans who may be able to appreciate what this film is trying to aim for but if you are looking for a good movie stay away25<SEP>0
a chemical spill is turning people into zombies its up to two doctors to survive the epidemic its an andreas schnaas film so you know what the par for the course will be bad acting horribly awful special effects and no budget to speak of the dubbing is ridiculous with a capital r and the saddest thing is that i feel compelled to write one word about this piece of excrement much less the ten lines mandatory because of the guidelines placed on me by imdb my original review of merely one word: crap wouldnt fly so i have to revise it and go more in to how bad it is but i dont know if i can so wait i think i may have enough words or lines rather to make this review pass which is cool i guess so in summation: this movie sucks balls dont watch itmy grade: f<SEP>0
i have seen a lot of stupid movies in my life a lot but this is without a doubt the worst one ever! i usually like dumb movies if they are somewhat entertaining but i cant even think of one good thing about this movie i like teen witch for heavens sake but sick has horrible acting lame porn music throughout the whole thing and even the sex scenes sucked! i would have to compare the lameness of this movie to the likes of twin dragons puppet master vs the demonic toys or even a very brady sequel although this is by far worse then any of those i beg you dont even waste your time believe me its 2 hours youll never get back<SEP>0
this is one of those unique horror films that requires a much more mature understanding of the word horror in order for it to be appreciated the main thing people may fail to realize that this story is told through the point of view a little boy and as with most younger children he gets frightened easily mainly because he simply doesnt understand things like why his father is hardly ever there for him from watching the film you can see the husband arguing with his wife the balance between work time and family time and you can easily understand it but the little boy doesnt also one can imagine the boy being afraid of the woods as it is established early on in the film that the family is from the city also in the beginning as the family is traveling to the house they hit a deer then get held up then they argue with the locals about it and the little boy surely didnt find this introduction to the woods pleasant at allthe wendigo is ultimately what his young innocent mind fabricates to explain all of this there is the american indian legend but when looking at the scene where the young boy hears about about it it is explained to him like bluntly and simplistically not because thats what the wendigo actually is but because that is how he understands it when you look at the film from this point of view you can really begin to appreciate it obviously it was low-budget and shot cheaply but the jumping montages use of light and general eeriness more than make up for it and the final question the film asks is: is it all in your head or is it really out there 810rated r: profanity violence and a sex scene<SEP>1
i know im in the minority butuwe boll is about as talented as a frog not even a toad; just a frog hes reminiscent of about a hundred other no-talent hacks who churn out one useless crap-fest after another this movie is a crap-fest slaters talent is only minimally utilized leading one to believe hes got other things like his failed relationship on his mind reid performs as if she has either forgotten her acting lessons been severely hit on the head and made to forget her acting lessons or has one of the worst directors in the history of film im voting on the third choice myself although the other two are always possible uwe boll has never done a single thing from which ive derived even the slightest pleasure frankly im satisfied that he made this stinker i was concerned with bloodrayne competing with underworld: evolution for ticket sales now im confident that len wiseman has nothing and i mean nothing to worry aboutthis rates a 1010 rating for this messy convoluted crap-fest fromthe fiend :<SEP>0
i can clearly see now why robin hood flopped quickly the first episode of it is probably the worst ever thing bbc has aired the opening scenes were about as intense meaningful and intelligent as two monkeys fighting robin hood had no character and the sword fight was just laughable the worst part of the episode was robin hood snogging some cow clad in make-up at the beginning of the episode - how many people wore eyeliner in the 12th century nobody the series may have improved drastically since then but this first episode quickly put peoples hopes down and is essentially a pile of cr*p a great hero of england has been disgracedwill you tolerate this i wont thats for sure unless the bbc start to understand what is a wise investment 310<SEP>0
this documentary is incredibly thought-provoking bringing you in to the lives of two long-time lovers who are in the final stages of aids the past footage of their twenty-some-odd years together really brings their final moments homeif this movie doesnt make you feel the pain and agony of these two fascinating people you dont have a heart<SEP>1
this reminded me soo much of michael winners crappy dirty weekend with its awful english low budget feelfirstly i must say i am a fan of both exploitation and serious film i appreciate say demented for its ineptitude and last house on the left for its sheer unashamed brutality and any number of inventive and increasingly brutal italian spin offsthis was just pointless though kind of like a british budget director thought lets remake i spit on your grave without making it too harrowing now that horror is back in fashion with hostelthe whole thing just doesnt hang together or have a point whats with the rapistss daughter why bother having the man be an expert in security cameras crappy<SEP>0
ll cool j morgan freeman dylan mcdermott kevin spacey john heard cary elwes roslyn sanchez justin timberlake -- wait a minute justin timberlake and hes the star i should have known better than to rent edison force in fact i did know better but in a moment of absolute weakness i rented this stv when you have big names like freeman and spacey in an stv you know its one of two things: an indie or a dog as in sat-on-a-shelf which this did and with good reason the plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la magnum force and journalist timberlake is the only one brave enough to uncover them he is targeted for his efforts -- or maybe i should say for his horrible acting i turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing just awful the real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard looking like nothing so much as a hobo you just know the director was not in control freeman is clearly slumming<SEP>0
if you loved deep cover you might like this film as well many of the poetic interludes fishburne recites in deep cover are from the lyrical script of once in the life a screen adaptation of a play that fishburne wrote if you love larry as much as i do youll love this film that is all larry all hot and all fleshed out of course there is gun play and illicit substance use this is a gangster movie of sorts after all but the script is beautiful and the story is touching even a little on the chick flick sideamazing filmdark frightening sexy and exciting if you ever sneaked out at night or hung out in a clubhouse youll get the proper impact of the cramped sets metephorically echoing being trapped in the life full of clever foreshadowing and complex relationships this film is tightevery sentiment mirrored in the set dressing and camera shots good work!<SEP>1
for me this movie just seemed to fall on its face the main problem for me was the casting of glover as a serial killer i dont know whether this grows out of type-casting or simply his demeanor but i doubt glover could ever portray a convincing villain hes a good guy and thats always obvious in his performances other than that the film is your run of the mill serial killer story nothing very innovative<SEP>0
coming immediately on the heels of match point 2005 a fine if somewhat self-repetitive piece of serious woody scoop gives new hope to allens small but die-hard band of followers among whom i number myself that the master has once again found his form a string of disappointing efforts culminating in the dreary melinda and melinda 2004 and the embarrassing anything else 2003 raised serious doubts that another first rate woody comedy with or without his own participation as an actor was in the cards happily the cards turn out to be a tarot deck that serves as scoops clever maguffin and proffers an optimistic reading for the future of woody allen comedyeven more encouraging woodys self-casting - sadly one of the weakest elements of his films in recent years - is here an inspired bit of self-parody as well as a humble recognition at last that he can no longer play romantic leads with women young enough to be his daughters or granddaughters in scoop allen astutely assigns himself the role of sid waterman an aging magician with cheap tricks and tired stage-patter who much like woody himself has brought his act to london where audiences - if not more receptive - are at least more polite like chaplins calvero in limelight 1952 sid waterman affords allen the opportunity to don the slightly distorted mask of an artist whose art has declined and whose audience is no longer large or appreciative moreover because they seem in character allens ticks and prolonged stammers are less distracting here than they have been in some time watermans character also functions neatly in the plot his fake magic body-dissolving box becomes the ironically plausible location for visitations from joe strombel ian mcshane a notorious journalistic muckraker and recent cardiac arrest victim introduced on a river styx ferryboat-to-hades strombel repeatedly jumps ship because he just cant rest in eternity without communicating one last scoop about the identity of the notorious tarot killer unfortunately his initial return from the dead leads him to watermans magic show and the only conduit for his hot lead turns out to be a journalism undergraduate sondra pransky scarlett johansson who has been called up from the audience as a comic butt for the magicians climactic trick sondra enthusiastically seizes the journalistic opportunity and drags the reluctant waterman into the investigation to play the role of her millionaire father as demonstrated in lost in translation johansson has a talent for comedy and the querulous by-play between her and allen is very amusing - and all the more so for never threatening to become a prelude to romancescoops serial killer plot involving grisly murders of prostitutes and an aristocratic chief suspect peter lyman hugh jackman is the no doubt predictable result of allens lengthy sabbatical exposure to londons ubiquitous jack the ripper landmarks and lore yet other facets of scoop as of match point also derive from woodys late life encounter with english culture its class structure manners idiom dress architecture and yes peculiar driving habits give woody fresh new material for wry observation of human behavior as well as sharp social satire when for instance sondra is trying to ingratiate herself with peter lyman at a ritzy private club waterman observes from his point of view were scum a good deal of humor is also generated by the contretemps of stiffly reserved british social manners encountering watermans insistent borscht-belt jewish plebeianism and then of course there is watermans hilarious exit in a smart car he cant remember to drive on the left side of the roadas usual allens humor in scoop includes heavy doses of in-jokes taking the form of sly allusions to film and literary sources as well as increasingly references to his own filmography in addition to the pervasive jack the ripper references for instance the films soundtrack is dominated by an arrangement of griegs the hall of the mountain king compulsively whistled by hans beckert in m the first masterpiece of the serial killer genre the post-funeral gathering of journalists who discuss the exploits of newly departed joe strombel clearly mimics the opening of broadway danny rose 1984 references to deconstructing harry 1997 include the use of death as a character along with his peculiar voice and costume the use of mandelbaum as a character name and the mention of adair university harrys alma mater and where sondra is now a student moreover the systematic use of greek mythology in the underworld river cruise to hades recalls the use of greek gods and a chorus in mighty aphrodite 1995as to quotable gags allens scripts rely less on one-liners than they did earlier in his career but scoop does provides at least a couple of memorable ones to a question about his religion waterman answers: i was born in the hebrew persuasion but later i converted to narcissism and sondra snaps off this put-down of watermans wannabe crime-detecting: if we put our heads together youll hear a hollow noise all in all scoop is by far woody allens most satisfying comedy in a decade<SEP>1
by far the most important requirement for any film following confidence tricksters is that they must at least occasionally be able to pull one over on us as well as their dumb-witted marks the cops the mob and ideally each other but this film never pulls this off every scam can be seen coming a mile off especially the biggen! neither are they very interesting intricate or sophisticated perhaps mammet hoped to compensate for this with snappy dialogue and complex psychological relationships if so he failed the lines are alright but theyre delivered in such a stilted unnatural stylised way that i thought perhaps some clever point was being made about us all acting all the time but it wasnt as for the psychological complexity the main characters a bit repressed and makes some ridiculously forced freudian slips about her father thinking shes a whore but she gets over it i really liked the street scenes though looked just like an edward hopper painting<SEP>0
i just saw this film i first saw it when i was 7 and could just about remember the end so i watched it like 10 minutes ago and i may seem like a baby as i am 12 ha-ha i started to cry at the ending i forgotten how sad it was i think i was mainly sad for anne-marie because she said: i love you charlie and also: ill miss you charlie just made me really cry ha-ha it has to be one of me favourite movies of all time it is just a film well worth watching watch it ha-ha thats all i can say xdbut i love this film its a true classicxx maverick xx 1010<SEP>1
if you as i have a very close and long relationship with the world of tintindo yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about hergé and his life creating tintin its so brilliant and a very cool production the whole background story about hergé and the people and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by for good and worse is amazing there is a very fine and obvious connection between the comic books and just this i will for sure be in my basement digging up the tintin albums again also the movie itself are very well told and has a great ambient sound to it i really do hope people will find this as intriguing as i did!<SEP>1
this movie bewilders me it may be that im just a stupid american but i really just dont get 400 blows everything ive read about this movie has been a total rave but i just couldnt stay interested im sure that it was as revolutionary in film-making as all the critics say but when it boils right down to it its just really really boring maybe its the language barrier may im just not sensitive or artsy enough but whatever the case is i hated this movie the story itself isnt bad; its about a young french boy who is treated unfairly by his parents and his teachers and eventually he ends up in a juvenile facility that in itself ought to be interesting and it was at first there was nothing wrong with the dialogue but then again its hard to say because half of the conversations werent subtitled and for no apparent reason so i didnt always know what was going on but for the dialogue we could understand it made enough sense the actors were believable enough but its hard to say what a real person would do in these situations so you feel for the main character but only in the sense that when he gets into trouble you think well that sucks the plot isnt even your typical plot each time he gets in trouble he gets into more trouble than the last time but the reasons never vary too much and through the entire film you realize that theres nothing the main character can really do about it so its more like just waiting to see how it ends the ending by the way was completely over my head its way too artsy for me and i just didnt get it leading up to the end was easy enough to follow the structure was certainly there and it made sense as well but everything was really drawn out for the amount of dialogue and significant moments the movie could have been an hour shorter it just didnt end part of it was the unnecessarily long shots none of which were especially memorable; for example the ending was a clip of the main character running down a country road that lasted a good thirty seconds now im sure that had some deeper meaning in it somewhere but for the average viewer id rather have gotten up to get some more food during that time or at least done something a little more useful than sit and watch this boy running like doing my laundry or taking a nap final verdict the feeling throughout the whole movie was that this probably would be very moving and just amazing and that it would teach me some great life lesson if i could only get what the director was trying to say by his unique decisions as it was i just felt cheated out of a good two hours of my life<SEP>0
back in the 1970s wpix ran the adventures of superman every weekday afternoon for quite a few years every once in a while wed get a treat when they would preempt neighboring shows to air superman and the mole men i always looked forward to those days watching it recently i was surprised at just how bad it really wasit wasnt bad because of the special effects or lack thereof true george reeves superman costume was pretty bad the edges of the foam padding used to make him look more imposing being plainly visible and true the mole mens costumes were even worse what was supposed to be a furry covering wouldnt have fooled a ten year-old since the zippers sleeve hems and badly pilling fabric badly tailored into baggy costumes were all painfully obvious but these were forgivable shortcomingsno what made it bad were the contrived plot devices time and again superman failed to do anything to keep the situation from deteriorating a lynch mob is searching for the creatures rather than round up the hysterical crowd or search for the creatures himself he stands around explaining the dangers of the situation to lois and the pr man the creatures are cornered again he stands around watching and talking but doesnt save them until theyre shot luke benson the towns rabble-rouser shoots at him attempted murder to any reasonable person but superman releases the man over and over to cause more problems superman had quite a few opportunities to nip the problem in the bud but never once took advantage of themthat said both george reeves and phyllis coates played their characters well seemingly instantly comfortable in the roles if only they had been given a better script to work with<SEP>0
not being familiar with us television stations when i flicked onto this on my in-laws cable first i thought it was just a low-budget sci-fi film then after a couple of minutes i started thinking it might be a clever satire on the worst excesses of christian fundamentalist and then it dawned on me - good grief these people are serious! its been a while since i saw anything so unintentionally hilarious i hesitated about writing a review of this for fear of offending believers but then i saw other reviews and thought hey they can take it tough philosophical conundrum: how do you make a movie criticizing movies without actually showing what it is youre criticizing answer: make it in such a way that the only people wholl appreciate it are people who hate the kind of movies youre criticizing i suppose some liberals ugh! spit when you say that! might be offended at the filmmakers contempt for those in the audience who arent obsessed with the j**** c***** myth but i didnt mind - it was so darn funny!<SEP>0
dominick nicky luciano wears a hulk t-shirt and trudges off everyday to perform his duties as a garbage man he uses his physical power in picking up others trash and hauling it to the town dump he reads comic-book hero stories and loves wrestlers and wrestling going to wrestlemania with his twin brother eugene on their birthday is a yearly tradition he talks kindly with the many people he comes in contact with during his day he reads comic books which he finds in the trash with a young boy who he often passes by while on the garbage route unfortunately dominick has a diminished ability to use his mind he has a disabilitydominicks disability came as a result of an injury to the head in which he suffered traumatic brain injury tbi this injury left him slower though it did not change his core characteristic as a strong individual who helps to protect others dominick is actually more able to live independently than he may seem at the beginning of the film he lives with eugene who is studying to become a doctor dominick provides the main source of income while eugene is off studying eugene must face the fact that he is to continue his education in a different city and that he must move away from dominick eugene also develops a romance which begins to separate him from his twin brotherthe film deals specifically with domestic abuse and how this can impact individuals families and then society as a whole the strain that escalates between eugene and dominick as eugene realizes that he must eventually leave nicky exploded on their birthday night eugene yells at dominick and throws him against the wall in this moment eugene must confront his own fears of being like his abusive father the father which dominick protected him against while he himself became the victim of the abuse this event cemented the love between the two brothers who from then on became the best of friends though they needed each other they also both needed independence and the ability to grow and develop relationship with others the fact that they must part ways became a very real emotional strain however by the end of the film dominick is able to say good bye to his brother and wish him luck eugene is able to leave his brother with the confidence that he has started to make a social network of people who care about him and will help him with his independencewhen dominick witnesses the abuse of his friend he is forced to come face to face with the cause of his own trauma in this state of extreme stress dominick almost completely shuts down he then runs after the ambulance to the hospital to see what happened to his friend after learning that the boy has died he is confronted by the abusive father who fearing his testimonial tells him he didnt see nothing doesnt know anything and not to say anything and that if he does he will kill him now that his own life has been threatened he goes and find the hand gun that larry used to kill the rats he goes to the wake of the deceased boy and at gunpoint kidnaps the baby of the grieving family he runs away from the scene and hides in a building when the police surround him eugene goes in the building to talk to his brother eugene then reveals the cause of dominicks disability and they bring the baby back the abusive father then wields a gun of his own threatening to kill dominick but eugene stops him and dominick tells the crowd that he saw the father throw his son down the stairsthrough the climactic ending the issue of dysfunctional behavior comes into view though dominicks instinct to save the baby can be understood we also see how damaging this response is dominick put the babys life and his own life in grave danger the larger societal consequences of these events is not directly implicated but rather shown through the films ending despite the more optimistic ending portrayal another sequence of events might just have likely occurred in which dominick is charged with kidnapping and possession of a firearm it is somewhat difficult to believe that this went completely unaccounted furthermore even if dominick is not charged there may still be a stigma against him within the community not that there wasnt one before these events instead the film shows that we must be able to recognize problematic behavior and act to curb itdominick and eugene was released in 1988 the same year as another film rainman which won 5 academy awards while rainman was an achievement and helped increase the visibility with person with disabilities it could be argued that dominick and eugene holds more valuable lessons for society whereas rainman demonstrated that mainstream american society might be able to learn from and care for a savant if the savant is the inheritor of a large estate dominick and eugene show that a person with a disability might be able to care for and help save members of american society the message of an independent person with disabilities may have been too strong for 1988 hopefully someday society will see the strengths of individuals with disabilities not as a threat but as imperative for the strength of society<SEP>1
while most of the movie is very amateurish the kosher slaughter scene is played up but not untrue kosher law says that an animal must be conscious when the blade touches its skin the kosher slaughter scene is accurate as anyone knows who has seen one or has seen the peta film showing a kosher slaughter in which the animals throat is cut and the esophagus cut out while it is still alive conscious and obviously suffering we must remember that history is written by the victors is one even allowed to even think that maybe the nazis were rightdoesnt it say anything that the nazis had outlawed this vicious religious slaughter and the jews are still practicing it even today<SEP>0
notorious for more than a quarter century and often banned its obscurity was its greatest asset it seems hey its often better to be talked about rather than actually seen when you cant back the legend up with substancethe film has played in los angeles a couple of times recently and is available on home video so that veil is slowly being lifted while there is still plenty to offend the masses it is more likely to bore them than arouse much real passion except for a gratuitous and protracted xxx sex scene between a pair of horses nature documentary anyone there follows nearly an hour of a dull arranged marriage melodrama once the sex and nudity begins it is a nonstop sequence involving masturbation a looooooooong flashback to an alleged beauty and the beast encounter and a naked woman running around the mansion nobody even her supposedly protective aunt seems to even think of putting some clothes on her! on video i guess you can fast-forward thru the banality but its not really worth the effort the nudity doesnt go beyond what is seen in something much more substantive such as bertoluccis the dreamerstry as one might to find some moral or symbolism in the carnality i doubt its worthy of anyones effort unfortunately for la bete now that you can more easily see the film the notoriety of something once forbidden has been lifted and this beast has been tamed<SEP>0

i watched the first 15 minutes thinking it was a real documentary with an irritatingly overly dramatic on camera producerwhen i realized it was all staged i thought why would i want to waste my time watching this junk so i turned it off and came online to warn other people the characters dont act in a believable way too much immature emotion for a guy to travel half way around the world into a war torn country he acted like a kid and i dont believe it was because his character was so upset about the trade center bombingsvery trite and stupidhave you seen city of lost children french dark fantasy film about a guy who kidnaps kids and steals their dreams i liked it!<SEP>0
ive read a few of the reviews and im kinda sad that a lot of the story seems glossed over its easy to do because its not a book its a movie and theres only so much that can be done in a movie- us or canadian- or anywherecolm feore does at least for a recovering f@g-hag like myself a great job of not only playing the friendly neighborhood gay man- but playing sick i mean the man really cant get much more pale! though you might never know it from the strip down near the um endif you need decrepit there are a few sking movies you might likebeing the daughter of a recovering alchoholic the druggie brother {david cubitt} was the trick for me im going to give him cred he grew up quick- and believe me thats good and as an aspiring writer moimeme i can dig a lot of his insights and overviews but im more prosy than poetici may be easy to please but i enjoyed it a nice story pretty well put together- by canadians quelle surprise just toed the line of the movie of the week missing it by not being as drawn out greatly appreciated and it was rather cleverly portrayed<SEP>1

this is one of those topics i can relate to a little more than most people as i hate noise & have no idea how those in big cities new york especially how people get any sleep at all! it astounds me that people can stand all the noise out there these days the basic plot of the film is that it makes for an interesting topic its too bad thats about it tim robbbins is decent although except for a couple of scenes especially with the absolute supermodel looking margarita leiveva he didnt seem to really be altogether there my biggest hope for this film is that casting agents will see the absolutely stunning & talented actress to boot margarita levieva she doesnt have a lot to do but she is supermodel beautiful even when they are trying to make her look at more girl next door it makes me sad that there can be people such as paris hilton & kim kardashian in the world wno redeemable skills or talent to have more fame and success than this talented beauty i didnt care for much of this film because the script isnt very good but am glad i got to see some new talent i hope that producers & directors think about margarita when they need a beautiful new actress to be in there big budget film if they can make megan fox a star cmon she isnt that hot & her acting talent is worse than made-for disney channel tv shows from 1 film it should happen easily for her as she is gorgeous & has talent! id recommend her changing her last name so we can pronounce it and make it more marketable heres hoping this makes her career & if there is any justice she can pop up on some big summer movie or two in the next couple years<SEP>0

can such an ambient production have failed its primary goal which was to correctly adapt allendes novel obviously yes bille august managed to make a superficial shallow film where basic elements of south american mentality are presented simply as side events resulting in total incoherency i cant believe there was a whole production team that could not understand the book! there is of course technical quality in this film and i think the actors did their best with what they had in their hands but something is missing and this something was the most important part<SEP>1
robert a heinleins classic novel starship troopers has been messed around with in recent years in everything to paul verhoevens 1997 film to a tv series to a number of games but none of these so to speak has really captured the spirit of his novel the games are usually unrelated the tv series was more of a spin off and the less said about verhoevens film the better little do most know however that in japan an animated adaptation had already been done released the year of heinleins death and believe it or not despite its differences this 6-part animated series is plot-wise the most faithful adaptation of heinleins classicthe most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons something we were deprived of in verhoevens film like the book the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel though we see a fair amount of each while events happen differently than in the book the feel of the books plot is present rico and carmen have a romantic entanglement but its only slightly more touched upon than in the book while some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book it gets a bit of the anime treatment but what did you expect but its far superior to the film heinleins political views are merely excised as opposed to the film where they are reversed the big payoff of the series however is the climatic battle on klendathu between the troopers and the bugsaliens which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film versionoverall i enjoyed this series because i wanted to see a vision closer to that of heinlein and i think they did pretty well with this if you can find this series give it a look<SEP>1

i am not so much like love sick as i image finally the film express sexual relationship of alex kik sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness frustration and jealous at last alex waked up and realized that they would not have result and futureending up was sadthe director tudor giurgiu was in amc theatre on sunday 12:00pm on 081006 with us watched the movie together after the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of romanian were kind of complicateon my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere i dont feel any particular impression and effect from the movie the love proceeding of alex and kiki and kiki and her brother sandu were kind of next door neighborhood storythe two main reasons i dont like this movie are firstly the film didnt told us how they started to fall in love sounds like after alex moved into the building which kiki was living then two girls are fall in love it doesnt make sense at all how a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man too much fragments you need to image and connect those stories by your mind secondly the whole film didnt have a scene of alex and kiks sexual intercourse that s what i was waiting for however it still had some parts were deserved to recommend the ear piercing part was kind of interesting alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kiks love that was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love also the scene of they were lying in the soccer field the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate<SEP>0
a classic cartoon always enjoyable and funny it has an interesting plot complete with lovable characters road rovers is a show worth seeing it is a short 13 episodes and if you can ever manage a chance to see it you should unfortunately it is very hard to find i think warner brothers studios should release a dvd that contains all 13 episodes i would definitely buy it if they did and if they do you should buy it too if you have kids who like dogs they will love road rovers! road rovers should have gotten more attention while it was being aired it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was<SEP>1
gregory pecks acting was excellent as one would expect and the cinematography quite stunning even when playing directly into some melodramatic moment but the rest of the film was overacted and hard to watch for me anyway i tried to like it but had to fast-forward through the last thirty minutes or so i feel i wasted a couple of good hours had it not been for gregory peck i wouldnt have lasted fifteen minutes 410<SEP>0
the return is one of those movies for that niche group of people who like movies that bore and confuse them at the same time sarah michelle gellar plays a lame buisnesswoman who does not kill vampires or get naked at all throughout the movie i was willing to put up with this however i was not willing to put up with the worst editing ever combined with pointless flashbacks at the end it turns out she crashes her car into herself when she was young or maybe im wrong and that was just a flashback with this movie its impossible to tell can you believe the same dude who made army of darkness produced this crap a much better idea is to stay at home and watch army of darkness on sci fi channel that movie had it all: sluts zombies and a dude with a chainsaw for an arm the forgotten didnt even have one of these things<SEP>0
greetings again from the darkness much anticipated twisted comedy from writerdirector richard shepard is a coming out party for pierce brosnan the actor that bond guy is gone this new guy is something else entirely!! have read that shepard thought brosnan was too much the pretty boy for this plum role but brosnan proves to be the perfect julian noble facilitator and is anything but pretty! do not underestimate how twisted the humor is in this one if you go expect punch lines and sight gags regarding all types of sex killing religion sports business and anything else you might deem politically incorrect brosnan takes an excellent script to another level with his marvelous facial gestures and physical movements even sitting on a hotel bed with or without a sombrero is a joy to beholdgreg kinnear is the straight guy to brosnans comic and has plenty of depth and comic timing to make this partnership click hope davis has a small but subtly effective supporting role as kinnears wife whats with her name bean who happens to get a little excited when she has a facilitator in her living roomthe visuals and settings are perfect - including a bullfight racetrack and denver suburb and how often do we get the killers and xavier cugat on the same soundtrack this one is definitely not for everyone but if your sense of humor is a bit off center and you enjoy risky film-making it could be for you<SEP>1
i dont know how or why this film has a meager rating on imdb this film accompanied by i am curious: blue is a masterworkthe only thing that will let you down in this film is if you dont like the process of film dont like psychology or if you were expecting hardcore pornographic rammingthis isnt a film that you will want to watch to unwind; its a film that you want to see like any other masterpiece with time attention and care******summaries may contain a spoiler or two*******the main thing about this film is that it blends the whole film within a film thing but it does it in such a way that sometimes you forget that the fictions arent realthe film is like many films in one:1 a political documentary about the social system in sweden at the time which in a lot of ways are still relevant to today interviews done by a young woman named lena2 a narrative about a filmmaker vilgot sjoman making a film he deals with a relationship with his star in the film and how he should have never got involved with people hes supposed to work with3 the film that vilgot is making its about a young woman named lenaie #2 who is young and very politically active she is making a documentary ie #1 she is also a coming of age and into her sexuality and the freedom of thatthe magnificence and sheer brilliance of i am curious: yellowblue is how these three elements are cut together in one moment you are watching an interview about politics and the next your watching what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes but does that so well that you sometimes forget that it is the narrativeanother thing is the dynamic between yellow and blue which if you see one you must see the other blue is not a sequel at all ill try to explain it best i can because to my knowledge no other films have done it though it is a great techniquethink of yellow as a living thing actual events in 14 scenes a complete talethink of blue as all the things in between the 14 scenes in yellow that you didnt see that is a complete tale on its ownessentially they are parallel films the same story told in two different waysit wasnt until i saw the first 30 minutes of blue that i fully understood yellowi hope this was helpful for people who are being discouraged by various influences because this film changed the way i looked at filmthanks for your time<SEP>1
im disappointed at the lack of posts on this surprising and effective little film jordi mollà probably best known for his role as diego in ted demmes blow writes directs and starsi wont give away any plot points as the movie at least for me was very exciting having not known anything about it if you have a netflix account or have access to a video store that would carry iti highly recommend it its a crazy fun and sometimes very thought provoking creationmollàs direction is *quite* impressive and shows a lot of promiseunpredictable with amazing imagery and a great lead performance spoken in beautiful spanish no somos nadie god is on air is an amazing film you can show off to your friendssee it<SEP>1
a group of forest rangers and scientists go into the woods to find fossilsthey stumble on a bigfoot burial ground eventually the didnt notice it in the dark the scenes of the cgi bigfoot are horrid but better than the endless scenes of talking that they rarely punctuate i used to think that there just might be a good bigfoot movie to be made but now after so many sad sad movies about the legend im having serious doubts to pour salt in the wound of watching this film the one good-looking girl just doesnt get naked once and while this one may be better than boggy creek 2 no mean feat there its still sad that the best non-documentary film on bigfoot remains harry and the henriksons my grade: d<SEP>0
new york i love you or rather should-be-titled manhattan i love looking at your people in sometimes love is a precise example of the difference between telling a story and telling a situation case in point look at two of the segments in the film one where ethan hawke lights a cigarette for a woman on a street and proceeds to chat her up with obnoxious sexy-talk and another with orlando bloom trying to score a movie with an incredulous demand from his director to read two dostoyevsky books while the latter isnt a great story by any stretch its at least something that has a beginning middle and end as the composer tries to score gets dostoyevky dumped in his lap and in the end gets some help and maybe something more from a girl hes been talking to as a liaison between him and the director the ethan hawke scene however is like nothing and feels like it like a fluke added in or directed by a filmmaker phoning it in or for that matter hawke with a combo of before sunrise and reality biteswhats irksome about the film overall is seeing the few stories that do work really well go up against the one or two possible stories and then the rest of the situations that unfold that are made to connect or overlap with one another ie bits involving bradley cooper drea dematteo hayden christensen andy garcia james caan natalie portman etc its not even so much that the film- set practically always in *manhattan* and not the new york of queens or staten island or the bronx not even say harlem or washington heights- lacks a good deal of diversity since there is some its the lack of imagination that one found in spades for better or worse in paris jtaime its mostly got little to do with new york except for passing references and at its worst the julie christieshia labeouf segment its incomprehensible on a level that is appallingso basically wait for tv and do your best to dip in and out of the film - in that is for three scenes: the aforementioned bloomchristina ricci segment which is charming; the brett ratner directed segment yes x-men 3 brett ratner with a very funny story of a teen taking a girl in a wheelchair to the prom only to come upon a great big twist; and eli wallach and cloris leachman as an adorable quite old couple walking along in brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary everything else can be missed even natalie portmans directorial debut and the return of a hughes brother only one allan to the screen a mixed bag is putting it lightly: its like having to search through a bag of mixed nuts full of crappy peanuts to find the few almonds left<SEP>0

i enjoyed this film perhaps because i had not seen any reviews etc it was delightful and a little bit of a romp i dont know why it didnt make more of a splash than it did as far as the story goes i could relate to some aspects of the paul reiser character and i could see my dad in falks character made me remember a lot of past times when i was a kid and listening to my grandparents too if you enjoyed movies like grumpy old men or on golden pond this is your movie a sleeper in my opinion and one of those feel-good stories peter falk and paul reiser had many wonderful verbal tussles yet nothing was overdone i would say it rates at least an 8 perhaps higher<SEP>1
this has to be one of the best movies to come out of hk in a long time i was eagerly waiting to get my hands on this movie just looking at the title loads of fantastic actors in this show and i was particularly impressed with sam lees impossibly believable insane behavior and edisons portrayal of a killer machine which totally reversed his normal idol image i would definitely recommend to those looking for a stylish and action packed movie however i must warn you this is also an equally depressing movie as every character in the movie is in some kind of dead end and trouble of their own and struggling to breathe makes you think about what is life about really<SEP>1
wow this movie was so horrible im so glad i didnt have to pay money to see this horrible movie it was like a history nut went on a coke binge! the previews of it made it look decent but it was really bad i will say the idea sounded decent but come on it was really really bad if u sat down and thought about it you would also realize it was unrealistic come on back in the day u think they had all that stuff to work with it wasnt like ben franklin sat down one day and made a damn riddle it was completely ridiculous and it you want to see a bad movie then by all means go see this one all and all horrible movie it might actually be on my top 10 worst films ive ever seen<SEP>0
having been pleasantly surprised by sandra bullocks performance in miss congeniality i decided to give murder by numbers a shot while decent in plucky self-effacing roles ms bullocks performance in serious roles see hope floats speed 2 28 days leave much to be desired her character is at the same time omniscient confused and sexually maladjusted the sub-plot of sandras past comes across as needless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character the two teenage boys gave decent performances although their forensics expertise and catch-me-if-can attitude is belied by stupid errors that scream we did it! chris penn as the all-too-obvious suspect is wasted here as is ben chaplins token partnerlove interest character***spoilers ahead*** mediocre acting aside the biggest flaws can be traced to a tv-of-the-week plot that never has you totally buying into the murder motives in the first place and as mentioned the stupid errors vomiting up a rare food on the murder scene an all too convenient and framing of the school janitor the two boys hanging out together in public a convenient love interest to cause friction etc etc cause the view to go from being intrigues to being bored and disappointed by the murderers the ending was strictly by the numbers and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie using the now-cliched tactic of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment the final scenes surprise no one and lacked any of the so-called intelligence the film purported to arrive at its conclusion a somewhat promising concept but poorly executed and weak in nearly every way * out of ****<SEP>0
i have seen many many films from china - and hong kong this is the worst no the worst one was unknown pleasures i watched platform yesterday evening and thought that jia zhang kes other two films must be better this evening i was disappointed again i will not be watching xiao wu tomorrow evening because i have just placed all three films in the bin! whoever gave this film platform ten out of ten needs to watch more cinema! the photography was very poor: it was very difficult to differentiate between some of the characters because of the lack of close-up work the storyline was so disjointed that i fast-forwarded it towards the end out of pure frustration i would not recommend this film to anyone give me zhang yimou or chen kage any day these are true masters of chinese cinema not pretentious con men!<SEP>0
i cant remember many films where a bumbling idiot of a hero was so funny throughout leslie cheung is such the antithesis of a hero that hes too dense to be seduced by a gorgeous vampire i had the good luck to see it on a big screen and to find a video to watch again and again 910<SEP>1
i watched both bourne identity and bourne supremacy on dvd before seeing this in the theater id been waiting for this since before they started filming i wasnt disappointedminor spoilers below- overall it was good but it also lacked the continuity of the first two identity and supremacy both flowed gracefully between adrenaline rush action to introspective drama this movie felt choppy at times the plot-building down-times were slightly too drawn out that caused the following action to feel too freneticcamera: speaking of frenetic the trademark greengrass shaky cam was present and very annoying to me i know its has been talkedwhined about to nausea on the message board but it doesnt mean its not relevant all the martial arts training the actors went through was totally wasted the ridiculous camera cuts and wiggling camera ruined most of the fighting in the movie it is a cheap student director trick to make the film feel unsettled id expect those techniques to be used in some horror flick made for high school kids but not in this classy adult action series too much extreme close-up also do some framing get some interesting shots constant close-up feels like lazy directing to mestory: the story was very confusing at first they thrust new names and faces upon you from the get go gave me the feeling that you get when you come into a movie late and know youve missed some crucial information felt rushed or compressed for time reasons after you catch up however the story is quite good its enjoyable following leads along with bourne however i did not care for the whole last scene of supremacy landybourne on the phone being in the middle of ultimatum thing it basically makes the movie a half-prequel i thought that was awkwardcastcharacters: the star of the movie is the action obviously there are only two originals left bourne and nicky parsons them teaming up was kind of odd to me i think they just wanted to give bourne someone to protect to and confide in unless i completely missed something they never even tell you why they teamed up the other assassins in the movie were pretty quiet this felt like gilroygreengrasswhoever wanting to not leave open ends understandable but disappointing seriously damon with clive owen in identity and marton csokas in supremacy those scenes were phenomenal these assassins are as uninteresting as castel the first fella bourne fights in identity the cast in general has degraded as the the series went on clive owen was practically an afterthought thats a measure of strength for that first cast the second they basically trade chris cooper for joan allen not exactly equal this one trades brian cox and franka potente for 3 actors to be named later nothing against david strathairn scott glenn or albert finney but theyre not the first names that come to mind for this kind of series aside from a couple pauses that seemed to long the acting was right onas a whole it was successful felt like they wanted to get the series over with though if they would have trimmed or rearranged the slower parts eliminated scott glenns part entirely zoomed out and taken the camera away from the seizure victim it would have been perfectending spoileri dont see why they leave bourne alive at the end it was my understanding this was the conclusion they clearly made reference to the very beginning of the series with his silhouette floating motionless i thought that was going to be it a full circle type of ending i did like nicky reacting to the news report thoughspoiler specifics warning - quote from movie below -bournes last line at the end look at this look at what they make you give quoting the first assassin he killed i loved that the final scene was great except that it was vosen {strathairn} that shot at bourne why would he do that just out for vengeance if he was angry enough to murder why not shoot pamela landy after she faxes his top secret file that didnt make sense<SEP>1
i had the pleasure of attending a screening of the pacific and eddy last weekend at the santa barbara international film festival this film had caught my attention a little while back when i stumbled across an article about it in jalouse magazine seemed interesting at the time but nothing too exciting anyhow i saw it on the festival program and decided to check it out all i can say is that i was speechless when the ending credits began to roll this is one of the most beautiful and refreshing films that i have seen in some time the photography art direction acting and especially directing were seamless and impeccable nothing is spelled out for you in this film and actually makes you think something that a vast majority of films today do the exact opposite the dialogue is carefully crafted and although this script is not wall to wall chatter the characters words are very deliberate and meaningfulits definitely one of those films that deserves a second viewing and the more you see it the more things you notice its a very layered and intelligent film not sure when or where its playing again but a definite must see for film enthusiasts<SEP>1
i just saw this movie the other day when i rented it and i thought this was going to be just another movie with a girl trying to prove a point but diane joined boxing because she wanted to i thought this movie was good i gave it a 810 thats how good it is plus a movie with michelle rodriguez is always good even is shes been in only six<SEP>1
this is an excellent show! i had a us history teacher in high school that was much like this there are many facts in history that are not quite true and mr wuhl points them out very well in a way that is unforgettablemr wuhl is teaching a class of film students but history students and even the general public will appreciate the witty way that he uncovers some very well known fallacies in the history of the world and strive to impress them upon that brains of his students use of live actors performing skits is also very entertaining i highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the history they learned as a child turned upside down<SEP>1

saw this my last day at the festival and was glad i stuck around that extra couple of days poetic moving and most surprisingly funny in its own strange way its so rare to see directors working in this style who are able to find true strangeness and humor in a hyper-realistic world without seeming precious or upsetting the balance manages to seem both improvised yet completely controlled it i hesitate to make comparisons because these filmmakers have really digested their influences cassavetes malick loach altmanthe usual suspects and found their own unique style but if you like modern directors in this tradition lynne ramsay david gordon greene youre in for a real treat this is a wonderful film and i hope more people get to see it if this film plays in a festival in your city go! go! go!<SEP>1
i was going to bed with my gf last night and while she was brushing her teeth i flipped channels until i came across this chinese movie called the king of masks at first i thought it was going to be a kung fu movie so i started watching it and then it immediately captured me in and i had to finish itthe little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble she was such a great actor for being so little maybe the fact it was in chinese so the english was dubbed made it harder for me to tellbut she really seemed to be in character perfectly i felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please her boss but everything just turned out rotten lol even when she brings him another grandson just so he can pass on his artit turns out that kid was kidnapped so he gets arrested and has 5 days to live lolwhatever she touches in an effort to be nice to her grandpa just backfiresin the end he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of maskswhich is just so heartwarming after all the mishaps in the moviedefinitely a gem and totally originalscott<SEP>1
presenting lily mars mgm 1943 is a cute film but in my opinion it could have been better judy garland is great as always but some scenes in the film seem out of place and the romance between her and van heflin develops all too quicklyi mean one minute hes ready to beat her butt but the next minute he falls in love with her i believe that this production the film editing and the script even though the photography was great the scenery was nice and the costumes were nice as well could have been a little better it feels as though the production was too rushed the supporting cast was good as well especially little janet chapman as the second youngest daughter daughter rosie she at the age of 11 looks really cute and its a shame that she didnt develop into a teenage comic actress shes much better in this film than in her previous films as warner brothers in the late 1930s except for broadway musketeers 1938 shes really good in that when they tried to make her into a shirley templesybil jason hybrid overall this film could better but in the end judy gave it her all<SEP>1
i like this movie a lot but its a fact that you cannot understand it unless youre from the ex yugoslavia most of the actors are now dead and those were the best actors in ex yugoslavia i appreciate that this movie is now on divx and i can have it in my collection macedonia serbia montenegro bosnia and herzegowina croatia sloveniaall of this was ex yugoslavia a melting pot of the balcan nations it could be a dream land if slobodan milosevic franjo tudjman and other nationalists wouldnt poison the nations mind with their sick ideas<SEP>1
pokemon 3 is little more than three or four episodes of the tv series strung together without the usual commercials the story is typical of pokemon conflict fighting and a resolution where all are happy in the end and there is nothing original or unusual in the animation some of the holes in the plot are filled in over the closing credits! without explanation and everything is just a bit too sweetwhy see it on the big screen the only reason is to be a part of your childs world both of my sons enjoy pokemon and by my showing an interest in what they like we are closer seeing a film in a theatre is still different than seeing it on the tube and my sons enjoy the full movie-going experience i gave the movie a 4 mostly from my childrens point of view<SEP>0
of all the reviews ive read most people have been exceedingly hard on alexandre neither marie or veronika ever seemed that they would particularly desperate to keep alexandre he being only slightly intelligent though not at all intellectual as most of us are however hard it may be for anyone to admit alexandre is getting away with life perfectly being totally taken care of getting and giving what he wants the girls are allowing this veronika loves sex marie is his patron is there anything wrong with any of this is anyone in love really i dont think so though french new wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on it is marvelous simply because of its lack of a need for a plot in order to create emotion ease is perfectly lovely and all anyone in alexandres position in an urban area can ask for im looking for a patron anyone interested<SEP>1
some people seem to think this was the worst movie they have ever seen and i understand where theyre coming from but i really have seen worsethat being said the movies that i can recall ie the ones i havent blocked out that were worse than this were so bad that they physically pained every sense that was involved with watching the movie the movies that are worse than war games 2 are the ones that make you want to gouge out your eyes or stab sharp objects in your ears to keep yourself from having another piece of your soul ripped away from you by the awfulnesswar games: the dead code isnt that bad but it comes pretty close yes i was a fan of the original but no i wasnt expecting miracles from this one lets face it the original wasnt really that great of a movie in the first place it was basically just a campy 80s teen romance flick with some geek-appeal to itthats all i was hoping for something bad but that might have tugged at my geek-strings was that too much to ask for is it really not possible to do better than the original war games even for a straight to video release well apparently that was too much to ask for stay away from this movie at first its just bad like oh yeah this is bad but im kind of enjoying it maybe the end will be good like in the original and then it just gets worse and worse and by the end trust me you will wish you had not seen this movie<SEP>0
i agree with jerry its a very underrated space movie of course how many good low-budget ones arent underrated if i remember correctly the solution to the mystery was a sort of variation but not rip-off of 2001 because the computer controlling the spaceship had actually been a man who had somehow been turned into a computer and like hal they tried to disconnect his mind but not the mechanical parts of him and as with hal it led to disaster there is at least one funny moment when the christopher cary character who cant find any food finds the abandoned pet bird theres a kind of ominous moment but then the obvious thing doesnt happen after all<SEP>1
this movie is so cheap its endearing!!! with ron liebmann major vaughn providing the most entertaining on-screen diatribes in film history i own 2 copies of this movie on videoon one ralph macchio is caught actually cracking up in the background at major vaugn while he is ranting at hash obviously they forgot to edit this mistake out of the film but it goes to show just how funny the movie is when the actors themselves cant keep a straight face!!!<SEP>1
xizao is a rare little movie it is simple and undemanding and at the same time so rewarding in emotion and joy the story is simple and the theme of old and new clashing is wonderfully introduced in the first scenes this theme is the essence of the movie but it would have fallen flat if it wasnt for the magnificent characters and the actors portraying themthe aging patriarch master liu is a relic of chinas pre-expansion days he runs a bath house in an old neighbourhood every single scene set in the bath house is a source of jelaousy for us stressed out unhappy people not even hardened cynics can find any flaws in this wonderful settingmaster lius mentally handicapped son er ming is the second truly powerful character in the movie coupled with his modern-life brother the interactions between these three people and the various visitors to the bath house are amazingly detailed and heart-felt with some scenes packing so much emotion its beyond almost everything seen in movieswith its regime-critical message this movie was not only censored but also given unreasonably small coverage it could be a coincidence but when a movie of this caliber is virtually impossible to find even on the internet! you cant help getting suspiciousso help free speech and the movie world buy rent copy this wonderful movie and if you happen to own the dvd if there even is one then share share share!<SEP>1
in any number of films you can find nicholas cage as a strong silent hero dennis hopper as a homicidal maniac lara flynn boyle as a vamptramp and the late lamented jt walsh as the heavy these are the types of roles these four can play in their sleep and they have done so often enough that to see them playing them again borders on cliche what a relief therefore that john dahl a master at getting a lot of mood out of a little action directed this nuanced noirish thriller hopper manages to keep from going over the top cage shows a little more depth than his usually-superficial action heroes boyle is by turns sultry innocent and scheming and one gets a sense of the hard iron of the soul that is central to his character wayne dahls direction gives a sense of the emptiness of the big sky country where the story takes place while also being intimate enough to show how a wrinkled brow can indicate a radical change of plot in store the plot twists are top-notch and one of the other great twists in this movie is that some of the supporting characters actually act as if they have brains it isnt often that minor characters like deputy sheriffs have more brains than their headlining superiors but with a director as smart as dahl you shouldnt be surprised by the intelligence of anything connected with this film an excellent movie<SEP>1
the one and only was a great film i had just finished viewing it on encorew on directv i am an independent professional wrestler and i thought this was a good portray of what life is like as a professional wrestler now this film was made 4 years before i was born but i dont think the rigors of professional wrestling traveling has changed all that much sad funny and all around great!!! **** 10+<SEP>1
the movie is okay it has its moments the music scenes are the best of all! the soundtrack is a true classic its a perfect album it starts out with lets go crazyappropriate for the beginning as its a great party song and very up-tempo take me with ua fun pop song the beautiful onesa cheerful ballad probably the closest thing to r&b on this whole album computer bluea somewhat angry anthem towards appolonia darling nikkione of the funniest songs ever it very vaguely makes fun of appolonia when doves crythe climax to this masterpiece i would die 4 u baby im a star and of course purple raina true classic a very appropriate ending for this classic album the movie and the album are both very good i highly recommend them!<SEP>1
it must have been several years after it was released so dont know why it was at the movies but as a kid i enjoyed it i just found a vhs tape of superman and the mole men at the flea market and decided to watch it again its been a lot of years i wasnt expecting much now knowing how the b movies were made at that time but i was pleasantly surprised to find the movie very watchable and the acting by all outstanding usual acting in these type movies leaves a lot to be desired surprisingly the writing wasnt bad either forget the fact that superman went from sequence to sequence and could have kicked all their butts in the beginning because then the story would have ended right! ok the mole men costumes were hokey and not very scary they didnt even scare me as a kid however making allowances for the probable low budget for background and costumes it was a job well done by all i recognized the sheriff right away as the old ranger from death valley days and plenty of supporting roles in tv westerns j farrell macdonald played old pop and was always a great supporting actor in more movies than i can count walter reed and jeff corey were familiar faces as well from other movies did you recognize the old doctor as the captain of the ship that went to get king kong did you recognize the little girl rolling the ball to the mole men as lisbeth searcy in old yeller some of the mole men were famous too jerry maren has played mayor mccheese for mcdonalds little oscar mayer was the munchkin that handed dorothy the lollipop was on a seifeld episode and a wealth of other work billy curtis played an unforgettable part with clint eastwood in high plains drifter was one of the friends met by the star in incredible shrinking man he had a part in a movie i just luckily grabbed at a flea market titled my gal sal with rita hayworth wizard of oz and plenty of other parts - great actor john brambury was also a munchkin phillis coates who played lois lane in this movie was without question wonderful in the part and george reeves as supermanclark kent was superman he did a great job of playing the strong man bottom line to all ive said is that this movie is worth watching because of the cast and writing in dealing with a pretty flimsy idea for a movie but it was the 50s and anything was possible from intruders from outer space to mole men from inner space it is definitely worth seeing there isnt a bad actor in the group whomever put the cast together was very very fortunate to get so many gifted actors into a b type film some already had a wealth of experience and some were about to obtain a wealth of experience - but all were gifted so if you get a chance to see the film forget the dopey costumes and just enjoy the excitement and acting is it a bird is it a plane no just a good old fashioned movie to enjoy!<SEP>1
a very engaging documentary about scottish artist andy goldsworthy whose work consists mostly of ephemeral sculptures made from elements from nature his work is made of rocks leaves grass ice etc that gets blown away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field thus most of goldsworthys works dont really last except as photos or films of what they were now one can argue that goldsworthys works are a reflection of mortality or words to that effect but isnt it easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art and at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter pretentious often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable unpretentious family oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small village in scotland of course im sure those are the same reasons why hes shunned by some people on the art world who found his works fluffy or superficial<SEP>1
watching this movie again really brought back some great childhood memories im 34 now have not seen it since i was 12-14 i had almost forgotten about this movie but when i watched it again recently some scenes literally brought a tear to my eye! that little robot jinxfriends for ever! it was just like revisiting my childhood it was an absolutely amazing experience for me i will always cherish this movie for that reason i hope some of you readers can relate to my experience not for this particular movie but any movie you have not seen in a long while very nostalgic-thanks for reading<SEP>1
this is one of the best episode from the second season of moh i think mick garris has a problem with women he killem all they are often the victims screwfly solution pro-life valerie on the stairs i dont remember the argentos episode in season 1 etc obviously imprint i think he enjoys to watch women been burn torture mutilated and i dont know never least right to die is one of the best with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense specially with the photos from the cell scene wonderful the acting is like the entire series regular i could be worst like pro-life or we scream for ice cream also i think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode the ideology of the series is horrible killing and terminating women mutilating animals and on and on the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like cigarrette burns the best of all homecoming the most funny imprint really shocking<SEP>1
on the surface this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation that is how to become a true self by embracing the so-called dark side of human nature thus we have the darkling a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company that is recognition of men and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled more or less successfully however if we dig a little deeper we find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person: - in the opening scene the main character male car mechanic fallen from graceis collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks with his daughter when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl lesson #1: cars are persons embodied with immortal souls and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery the wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished - just after that another character rubin buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a once-lost-now-found famous race-car and is warned by the salesman lesson #2: just like any other person a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced in addition there is the twist that rubin actually sees a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of rubins own personal greed for more profit lesson #3: thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only but always as an end in itself - then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to rubin and more importantly rubins car: the main characters assessment of the cars qualities is not just based on its outer appearance but also by a thorough look inside the engine room lesson #4: a car is not just to be judged by its looks it is what is inside that really counts there is punishment in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell rubin a fake collectors car this scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson #3 there are numerous other examples in the movie of the car=person-theme and i am too tired now to bother citing all of them but the point remains and i guess this is what im really trying to say that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do - or if youre a car devotee<SEP>0
splendid film that in just eight minutes displays an unusual genre mix: mystery thriller musical briefly we are allowed to tell about the story: a girl comes into a european cafeteria and then soft transit from nonsense mystery to narrative logic in a no time no place way vigalondo managed a delight in bw by means of imagination and despite thanks to the tightest of budgetsbecause of the unity of time-space the film reaches the intensity of a short poem almost a haiku spain land of quick poetry in bw ¿remember the early buñuela must see for reassuring our belief in young cinema outside the states<SEP>1
well i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it was funny and sad and yes the guy andie macdowell shagged was hot interesting realistic characters and plots as well as beautiful scenery i think my mum would like it i still think they should have been allowed to call it the sad f**kers club though<SEP>1
peter jacksons versions are better films overall from objective point of view that being said they are not my favorite screen versions of lord of the rings and let me explain why firstly the acting of the on-screen characters is just too ordinary and uninspiring with jacksons lotr the whole cast is too run of the mill are you claiming that those silly cartoon characters of ralph bakshi version are better actors than real people one could ask well they are not really sillysave for hobbits later about them and they certainly pack more personality than jacksons party - even with much more limited dialogue time and that is because of superior _voice_ acting of the bakshis lotr take aragorn for example in this version his voice is deep and charismatic with full of authorityaragorn the lordand with a seasoned rasparagorn the ranger this is due to john hurts brilliant voice acting compare that to viggo mortensens rather high pitched sound with no soul and the duel gets quickly uneven: hurt beats mortensen hands down and then there is gandalf probably the most dominatingand the most popular character in the whole saga in this bakshi version gandalfwilliam squire is a real wizard and by that i dont mean he shoots bolts from his fingertipshe does not but his presence is just captivating he is a mystical powerful and can switch from gentle old man to a scary person with ease add to that his looks: tall old as the ancient oak beard long as his body sharp eyes wizardy hook nose and of course the classical wizard hat a perfect gandalf just like in the books ian mckellens gandalf in the other hand is simply just too boring he looks too human sounds too human acts too human and wears no hat or wields no sword yes a sword in this bakshi version gandalf scores couple of bloody orc kills with his swordas he did in the books and those are stylish slow motion kills gandalf is not a power to be messed with and it must be noted that while im sad to say this the great christopher lee didnt bring saruman alive fraser kerr in this movie did even with a very limited screen time and linesbefore i move completely to visual aspects of the movie it must be mentioned that the voice acting and the general presenation of the orcs are also superior to jacksons pretendeous bad guys bakshis orcs taunt their enemiesor each other constantly with growls screams and nasty language they are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion and finally the black riders - or the nazgul those ultimate bad guys are scary ghosts in this one - not just some riders wearing black and they speak with haunting voice which mesmerizes their victim my favorite scene in the film is when the nazgul are chasing frodo near the river while peter jackson couldnt do anything but show the riders simply chasing the party bakshi throws in a nightmarish dream with some cool slow motion scenes and thundering skybut as much i like this film more than jacksons the latter are if only technically still better and that is because of some key visuals as you know bakshi lotr features a mixture of animated charactersall hobbits and the main cast and real actors covered with paint i dont really have a problem using real people in animation this way but they just dont fit very well with traditional cartoon figures this is especially true with humansriders of rohan tavern people etc orcs are different matter since they are meant to look very distinctive from other characters orcs while played by humans with animation mix look far superior to jacksons version they have brownish-green skin shiny red eyes flat face and pointed teeth biggest screw up in this films visuals howerver are the hobbits while i prefer almost every character in bakshi version compared to jackson the latter has clearly superior hobbits in fact they are perfect with bakshi you get some irritating and rather poorly drawn humanoid disney bambies and you are forced to spend a lot of movie time with them so be warned again the voice acting is ok with them too but the actors mouths cannot save the immersion damage made by these little weasels well i never really liked those halflings anyway general failures in the bakshi script are well known limited playing timewith limited budget and a lot of missing scenes so while this film covers nearly half of the story it doesnt do it in extensive detail compared to jacksons version in a summary the ralph bakshi version of lotr has a superior:-overall atmosphere it feels more like middle-earth -overall voice acting -music i really dig the fantasy score by kont & rosenman -gandalf -aragorn one of the john hurts finest roles -king theoden -orcs -black riders -elrond hes not some fairy hippie in this one!while jackson version is better:-because it covers the whole story -overall visuals and special effects -gollumsmeagol -balrog -hobbitslord of the rings by ralph bakshi even with its well known shortcomings is one of the best animation films ever made and it captures the atmosphere of tolkiens fantasy world very well if not perfectly ill give it a score of 8½ out of 10<SEP>1
a young woman who is a successful model and is also engaged to be married and who has twice attempted suicide in the past is chosen by a secretive and distant association of catholic priests to be the next sentinel to the gateway to hell which apparently goes through a creepy old but well maintained brooklyn apartment building its tenants take the stairway up and can reincarnate themselves but apparently cant escape as long as a sentinel is there to block the way the previous onejohn carradine is about dead so she by fate or whatever becomes the next one and the doomed must get her to kill herself in order for them to be free lots of interesting details lie under the surface her relationship with her father the stories of the doomed her fiancé so one can pass this off as cheap exploitation horror but given the sets the great cast and overall level of bizarreness this is definitely worth seeing<SEP>1
i enjoyed this film i thought it was an excellent political thriller about something thats never happened before - a secret service agent going bad and involved in an assassination plot unfortunately for michael douglas character pete garrison they think hes the mole but he isnt hes just a morally-flawed agent having an affair with the first lady! since hes doing that hes unable to give an acceptable polygraph exam and that makes him suspect number one when its revealed there is a plot to kill the presidentgarrison is forced to go on the lam but at the same time hes still trying to do the right thing by protecting the president douglas does a fine job in this role i dont always care the people he plays but hes an excellent actor keifer sutherland david breckinridge is equally as good at least in here as the fellow ss boss who hunts down douglas until convinced he has been telling the truth when he does the two of them work together in the finale to discover and then stop if they can the plot the crooks are interesting too by the way also i have never - and never will unfortunately - see a first lady who looks as good as kim basingerthis is simply a slick action flick that entertains start-to-finish are there holes in it of course; probably a number of them and a reason you see so many critical comments however it is unfairly bashed here it just isnt intelligent enough for the geniuses here on this website my advice: chill just go along for the ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue yes it gets a little rambo-ish at the end but otherwise it gets high marks for entertainmentwhich is what movies are all about<SEP>1
*** may contain spoilers *** if living on tokyo time were some bold experiment where real-life wanna-be actors were given film parts on the condition that they would be required to take a combination of powerful prescription anti-anxiety anti-depression and anti-psychotic medications this is the classic psych ward combo that renders patients into drooling zombies all during filming then this movie would hold far more interest or if the film production was another type of experiment where all of the actors were sleep deprived before and during filming then tokyo time could be more easily explainedas it is this film is filled with lifeless low-energy actors in the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs talking with his sister it appeared that he was having trouble keeping his eyes open in almost every scene he speaks his lines sitting down with every part of his body motionless from beginning to end his facial expression is best described as near sleepfret not about the actors speaking over each others lines because these actors can barely finish droning out any lines of dialog everyone speaks with a depressing monotone voice no laughing no yelling no vigor no one has energy enough to crack a smile the result: complete and total boredomand it does not help matters that the direction is simple and amateurishavoid this lifeless film at all costs better to watch greencard which has a similar plot and has charm and energy or for an unconventional japanese romance story check out the long vacation which has an ample amount of everything living on tokyo time does not<SEP>0
this is an absurdist dark comedy from belgium shot perfectly in crisp black and white benoît poelvoorde man bites dog is on fine form as roger the angry obsessive father of a family in a small sullen belgian mining town roger is a photographer who along with his young daughter luise visits road accidents to take photos he is also obsessed with winning a car by entering a competition where the contestant has to break a record - and he decides that his son michel must attempt to break the record of perpetually walking through a door - he even hires an overweight coach to train him michel dresses as elvis and has a spot on a radio show called cinema lies where he describes mistakes in films luise is friendly with near neighbour felix a pigeon fancier roger is a callous figure as he pushes michel right over the limit during the record attempt which almost results in his death interspersed throughout the film are magritte-like surreal images its undeniably charming and well worth your time<SEP>1
this serial is interesting to watch as an mst3k feature but for todays audience thats all it is i was really surprised to see the year it was made as 1952 considering that fact alone makes this a solid lowly 2 in my book the cars used dont even look contemporary they look like stuff from the 30s its basically cody the lone worlds salvation sheesh talk about an insult to everyone else like the military anyway its cody in his nipple ring flying suit against graber and daley two dumb*ss henchman who sport handguns and an occasional ray gun thats pretty lame in its own right enjoy if you want to watch a really good serial see flash gordan its full of rockets that attack each other and a good evil nemesis and also good looking women this has none of that and flash was made 15 or so years before this crap so you can give it some slack something made in 1952 this bad deserves a 2 nuff said give it a 6 if your watching it as a mst3k episode those guys have some good fun with it; a tweak of the nipples here a tweak there and im flying! and now as an added bonus i bring you the commander cody theme song as originally sung by joel and his two character bots tom servo and crow aboard the satellite of love for episode eight the enemy planet:singing at the very beginning credits;tom servo singing your watching commander cody he is the new character from republiche gets in trouble every week but hes saved by editingjust a tweak of his nipples sends him on his waya pumpkin head and a rocket pack will save the dayjoel singing his labratory is a boxing ring when bad guys come to mix it upsomebody always gets kidnapped and cody has to fix it uphe drinks his tea at als cafe and flies along on wireshe beats the crooks and flies with hooks and puts out forest firescrow singingbad guys beware cody is thereyoull like his hair its under his helmut and because we cant think of a good rhymethats the end of the commander cody theme song so sit right back with a will of graniteand watch chapter eight cause thats the enemy planet<SEP>0
this is a film that had a lot to live down to on the year of its release legendary film critic barry norman considered it the worst film of the year and id heard nothing but bad things about it especially a plot that was criticised for being too complicated to be honest the plot is something of a red herring and the film suffers even more when the word plot is used because as far as i can see there is no plot as such theres something involving russian gangsters a character called pete thompson whos trying to get his wife sarah pregnant and an irish bloke called sean how they all fit into something called a plot im not sure its difficult to explain the plots of guy ritchie films but if you watch any of his films im sure we can all agree that they all posses one no matter how complicated they may seem on first viewing likewise a james bond film though the plots are stretched out with action scenes you will have a serious problem believing rancid aluminium has any type of central plot that can be cogently explained taking a look at the cast list will ring enough warning bells as to what sort of film youll be watching sadie frost has appeared in some of the worst british films made in the last 15 years and shes doing nothing to become inconsistent steven berkoff gives acting a bad name and he plays a character called kant which sums up the wit of this movie while one of the supporting characters is played by a tv presenter presumably because no serious actress would be seen dead in this the only good thing i can say about this movie is that its utterly forgettable i saw it a few days ago and immediately after watching i was going to write a very long a critical review warning people what they are letting themselves in for by watching but by now ive mainly forgotten why but this doesnt alter the fact that i remember disliking this piece of crap immensely<SEP>0
this show has a few clichés and a few over the top dawsons creek-like moments a 16-year-old talking about way back when life made sense but overall it seems like a decent show most of the characters seem very real and the story seemed to move along well in the pilot - ending with a good lesson in the end i just hope every episode doesnt turn out to be life-altering like the first that would just be too much drama for this vehicle jeremy sumpter does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball i believe a lot of us could relate to his awe and sometimes tunnel vision for the team that he always wanted to a part of<SEP>1
florence chadwick was actually the far more accomplished swimmer of course she swam the english channel both directions she swam from catalina island to the california coast marilyn bells is a sweet story but the usual glorification of us canadians in the face of a superior world another sample of our inferiority complex our political system works pretty well and the health system allows people not to die in hospital lobbies thats pretty good better than lebanon what should we do about hockey though and curling the notion of calling this a sport of its inclusion in the olympics! ah but we digress<SEP>0
in lizzie bordens love crimes 1992 sean young plays a gritty da in atlanta shes a loner who gets herself too deeply involved in the case of a man patrick bergin who poses as a famous fashion photographer and seduces women takes compromising photos of them then leaves themnaturally this tough loner decides to enter the phony shutterbugs life by posing as his prey intending to bring him to justice they meet they make love then the next thing she knows she is over his lap getting spanked note: the spanking scene is only in the unrated version of this film the r-rated version omits it and several other scenes that would make the plot more lucid this psychological thriller includes several scenes of female nudity and disturbing images such as bergin chasing one of his victims around the room flailing at her with a riding cropas a thriller love crimes is at its best when sean young is playing her cat-and-mouse game with bergin trying to catch him in an incriminating act its unfortunate that the film doesnt end it just stops thats true director lizzie borden may have just run out of story to tell but after 92 minutes the credits roll and we are left with a puzzling what just happened bewildermentthe unfolding of youngs plan is played out in engaging style but the lack of a coherent ending will be a turn-off for some viewersdan daneldorado@yahoocom<SEP>1
i cant believe how anyone can make a comedy about an issue such as homelessness of course brooks has not made a comedy about _real_ homeless people no mention of drugs prostitution or violence on these streets the people we meet in this movie are homeless in fantasy land so the only difference between them and us is that they dont eat quite as often brooks movies have become worse and worse over the years this is just another nail in the coffin<SEP>0
despite reading the initial comments from someone who curiously disliked the film -- why is the only negative comment very first on the listit was very nice to note that virtually everyone else loved it! obviously the church wanted to stress certain points and portray the prophet joseph smith in a positive manner ~ thats the whole idea and in fact those points were extremely effective we already know joseph smith was human but despite that and all of the horrific negative attempts stirred on by the adversary it showed just how he was able to complete a remarkable god-given work id recommend it to anyone!<SEP>1
this film was one of my childhood favorites and i must say that unlike some other films i liked in that period the thief of bagdad has held on to its quality while i grew up this is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well the only drawback there is is that one can not see past the bad effects compared to the effects nowadays like one could when one was a child i remembered nothing of those effects of course it had been about ten years since id seen this film when i was about eleven years old who then watches effects one only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides in my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century coming to think of it i feel like the indiana jones films are quite a like this film there is comedy romance and adventure all in one which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning until the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern it succeeds in not being dusty and old all of that is mainly due to the great story the good directing and the good acting performances of the actors in that department sabu as abu and conrad veidt as jaffar stand out providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part great film and although an oldie definitely a goldie i hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on dvd someday8 out of 10<SEP>1
there are so many stupid moments in tower of deathgame of death 2 that you really wonder if its a spoof at times it felt like i was watching a sequel to kung pow rather than a bruce lee filmto be honest this film has bugger all to do with game of death if anything its more a sequelremake of enter the dragon incorporating many elements of that film - particularly the actual footage bruce lees character billy lo apparently investigates the sudden death of his friend and encounters a piece of film that was left with the mans daughter when the body is stolen during the funeral ! billy is also killed and its up to his wayward brother to avenge both mens deathstong long stars as brother bobby lo and doesnt really have the sort of charisma to carry the film his fighting abilities are very good however bruce lee obviously turns up thanks to no longer deleted footage simply to cash-in on the legacy saying that on the whole the footage is actually edited-in better than in game of death but it doesnt stop the film from being a messok so the fights are actually very entertaining dare i say mind-blowing and make the film at least watchable but there are so many daft elements to this film that it really tests your patience first off theres the supposed villain who lives on his palatial estate or is that mental institution seriously the nutter eats raw venison drinks deers blood carries a monkey on his shoulder and owns some peacocks and lions ! this attempt to make him look tough and intelligent just makes you feel sorry for him - you half expect someone to escort him back to his roomin fact this middle section is awful and when the scene involving a naked hooker and a lion suit arrived i turned it off however i did finish the film and was kind of glad i did because the fight scene towards the end much like god was the whole reason for watching while the story is an embarrassment the action is very good and contains excellent choreographybut even the finale disappoints if the premise was anything to go by what we were told was that the tower of death was a pagoda that was upside down and underground this sounded great like a twist on bruce lees original idea with different styles of fighting on each level could this be the game of death that was originally planned no! the film should have been named generator room of death because thats as far as the tower goes of yes there were indeed one or two different styles there were foil clad grunts leopard-skinned henchman and stupid monk its as though enter the dragon had never been made with the plot being a poor imitationworth watching once for the fast paced fight scenes but so stupid sometimes that it hurts if this was intended then fine thumbs up however for recreating that projector room scene from enter the dragon<SEP>0
this is one of those landmark films which needs to be situated in the context of timedarkness in tallinn was made in 1993it was a period of chaosconfusion and gross disorder not only for ordinary denizens of estonia but also for countless citizens of other former nations which were a part of mighty soviet empireit was in such a tense climate that a young country named estonia was bornas newly established governments are known to encounter teething problemsestonia too faced numerous troubles as some corrupt officials manipulated state machinery for filling their dirty pockets by making use of their selfish meansthis is one of this films core themesdarkness in tallinn appears as an estonian film but it was made by a finnish director ilka järvilaturi he has tried his best to infuse as many possible doses of estonian humorthis is why one can call it a comedy film of political undertonesas ordinary people are involved in this film we can say that this film signifies good versus evilthis is not a new concept as it is readily available in most of the religious books of different faithsdarkness in talinn shows us as to how ordinary governments can also be toppled by corrupt peoplea nice film to watch on a sunny day<SEP>1
there is a scene in dan in real life where the family is competing to see which sex can finish the crossword puzzle first the answer to one of the clues is murphys law: anything that can go wrong will go wrong this is exactly the case for dan burns steve carell the office a columnist for the local newspaper dan is an expert at giving advice for everyday life yet he comes to realize that things arent so picture perfect in his own dan in real life is amazing at capturing these ironies of everyday life and is successful at embracing the comedy tragedy and beauty of them all besides that this movie is pretty damn hilariousthe death of his wife forces dan to raise his three daughters all on his own each daughter in their own pivotal stages in life: the first one anxious to try out her drivers license the middle one well into her teenage angst phase and the youngest one drifting away from early childhood things take a turn for dan when he goes to rhode island for a family reunion and stumbles across an intriguing woman in a bookstoreher name is marie juliette binoche chocolat and she is looking for a book to help her avoid awkward situations which is precisely whats in store when they get thrown into the burns family householdif youve seen steve carell in the office or little miss sunshine youd know that he is incomparable with comedic timing and a tremendously dynamic actor as well steve carell is awesome at capturing all the emotions that come with family life: the frustration and sincere compassion the family as well as the house itself provides a warm environment for the movie that contrasts the inner turmoil that builds throughout the movie and finally bursts out in a pretty suspenseful climax the movie only falls short in some of the predictable outcomes yet at the same time life is made up of both irony and predictability: which is an irony within itselfdan in real life is definitely worth seeing for the sole enjoyment of watching all the funny subtleties we often miss in everyday life and ill most likely enjoy it a second time or even a third just put it on my tab<SEP>1
if there was some weird inversed oscar academy awards festival this flick would win it all it has all the gods excellent plot extreme special effects coupled with extremely good acting skills and of course in every role there is a celebrity superstar well this could be the scenario if the world was inversed but its not instead its the worst horror flick ever made not only bad actors that seem to read the scripts from a teleprinter with bad dyslexia but also extremely low on special effects for example the devil costume which by the way is a must-see is something of the most hilarious ive ever seen whenever i saw that red-black so called monster on screen i couldnt hold my laugh back and to top of things it looked like the funny creature was transported by a conveyor-beltdo not do the same mistake as i did checking imdb seeing that the movie was released in 2003 had less than five votes and thinking: -well its worth a shot cant be that badyes it couldim not even going to waste more words on this movie<SEP>0
some news reporters and their military escorts try to tell the truth about a epidemic of zombies despite the government controlling the media the makings of the film dont understand that the george romero zombie films only worked because he kept his politics subtly in the background of most of his films land of the dead withstanding this satire is about as subtle as a brick to the face or a bullet to the head is more apropos for this scenario whats subversive or subtle about seeing a military guy masturbating to death and destruction anything nuanced about the various commercials that are inter-cut with the film nope furthermore the acting is uniformly horrible the characters thoroughly unlikable and the plot inane add this all up and you have the worst most incompetent zombie film since chud 2 reared its hideous headmy grade: d<SEP>0

awful simply awful it proves my theory about star power this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed battlestar titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick b o r i n gfind something a thousand times more interesting to do - like watch your tv with no picture and no sound 110 i rated it so high bc there arent any negative scores in the imdbcom rating system-zaphoidps: my theory about star power is: the more star power used in a show the weaker the show is its called an indirect proportionality: quality 1star power less sp makes for better quality etc another way to look at it is: more is less-z<SEP>0
cypher is a clever effective and eerie film that delivers its good premise is presented well and it has its content delivered in an effective manner but also in a way the genre demands although one could immediately label the film a science fiction there is a little more to it it has its obvious science fiction traits but the film resembles more of a noirdetective feel than anything else which really adds to the storythe film overall plays out like its some kind of nightmare; thus building and retaining a good atmosphere were never sure of what exactly is going on were never certain why certain things that are happening actually are and were not entirely sure of certain people similar to having a dream  the ambiguity reigns over us all  hero included and i havent seen this pulled off in such a manner in a film before bar terry gilliams brazil going with the eeriness stated earlier cypher presents itself with elements of horror as well as detective noir and science fiction giving the feeling that theres something in there for everyone and it integrates its elements wellthere is also an espionage feeling to the film that aids the detective side of the story the mystery surrounding just about everyone is disturbing to say the least and i find the fact that the character of rita foster liu who is supposed to resemble a femme fatale can be seen as less of a threat to that of everything else happening around the hero: people whom appear as friends actually arent people who say theyre helping are actually using and those that appear harmless enough are actually deadlier than they look despite a lot of switching things around twisting the plot several times and following orders that are put across in a way to make them seem that the world will end if theyre not carried out; the one thing that seems the most dangerous is any romantic link or connection with lucy lius character  and shes trying to help out! the film maintains that feeling of two sides battling a war of espionage spying and keeping one up on its employees and opponents the whole thing plays out like some sort of mini-cold war; something that resembles the usa and the ussr in their war of words heyday and it really pulls through given the black bleak often cgi littered screen that i was glued to what was also rather interesting and was a nice added touch was the travel insert shot of certain american states made to resemble computer microchips as our hero flies to and from his stated destinations  significant then how the more he acts on his and fosters own motivation this sequence disappears because hes breaking away from the computerised repetitive controlled life that hes being told to live and is branching outcyhper is very consistent in its content and has all the elements of a good film to say it resembles the first jason bourne film only set in the sci-fi genre isnt cutting it enough slack but you can see the similarities; despite them both being released in the same year like i mentioned earlier there feels like there is something in this film for everyone and if you can look past the rather disappointing ending that a few people may successfully predict you will find yourself enjoying this film<SEP>1
a wonder one of the best musicals ever the three busby berkely numbers that end the movie are spectacular but what makes this film so wonderful is the incredible non-stop patter and the natural acting of cagney and blondell keeler is also lovely even though she may not have been a great actress theres a freshness in the movie that you dont see in flicks today much less in the usually stilted 30s films even though the plot involving the setting up of movies prologues is quite dated<SEP>1
movie comedies nowadays are generally 100 minutes of toilet humor foul language and groin-kicking modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator the undemanding and slow of brain sure an occasional good comedy will come along but theyre becoming rarer all the timemr blandings buildings his dream house shows what 1940s hollywood was capable of and its just screamingly funny jim and muriel blandings cary grant and myrna loy decide to build a house in the connecticut suburbs the film follows their story beginning with house hunting trips the houses riotous construction all the way to the finished home--with its zuzz-zuzz water softenergrant and loy are perfect for their roles of course grant is particularly funny as he watches the houses costs zoom out of control however the film is stolen by the blandings wise attorney played to perfection by melvyn douglas managing to steal every scene hes in douglas is understatedly hilarious while he watches the blandings lurch from crisis to crisis reginald denny as the blandings harried architect and harry shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderfulive watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh i think its a good film to watch when you need a lift whether youre building a house or not<SEP>1
carriers follows the exploits of two guys and two gals in a stolen mercedes with the words road warrior on the hood hightailing it down the highway for the beach with surfboards strapped to the top of their car brian chris pine of star trek is driving and his girlfriend bobby piper perabo of coyote uglyhas shotgun while brians younger brother danny lou taylor pucci of fanboys and his friend--not exactly girlfriend--kate emily vancamp of the ring 2 occupy the backseat this quartet of twentysomething characters are living in a nightmare apparently a viral pandemic--which co-directors & co-scenarists alex pastor and david pastor tell us absolutely nothing about--has devastated america naturally the lack of exposition shaves off at least fifteen minutes that would have slowed down this cynical melodrama about how humans degenerate in a crisis and become their own worst enemiesthis lethal virus gives you the shingles and then you bleed and die most everybody runs around wearing those white masks strapped to their nose and mouth by a thin rubber band initially this foursome encounters a desperate father frank christopher meloni of runaway brideand his cute little daughter jodie kiernan shipka of land of the lost blocking the highway with their suv brian swerves around frank when he tries to waylay them but in the process the oil pan in their mercedes ruptures and they wind up on foot reluctantly they hitch a ride with frank after they seal jodie up in the rear of the suv she wears a mask over her nose and mouth and it is speckled with blood frank has heard that doctors are curing ailing people at a hospital and they head to it sadly somebody has lied to frank the hospital physician is giving the last couple of kids some kool-aid that will put them out of their misery the cure did not improve their condition everybody else in town is dead kate tries without success to get a dial tone on every phone frank realizes that there is no hope for his daughter and he lets the heroic quartet appropriate his suv and take offindeed carriers qualifies as a relentlessly depressing movie about the effects of a pandemic on four sympathetic people who degenerate into homicidal murderers to protect themselves they reach a country club and frolic around on a golf course until another four show up in suits and masks with pump-action shotguns incredibly our protagonists manage to escape without getting shot but brian has a scare when he almost falls into the water with a floating corpse eventually they discover that one of them has become infected later as they are about to run out of gas brian blocks the highway like frank did at the outset danny tries to stop a pair of older christian women driving the car danny lies that his pregnant wife is about to give birth and he needs their help brian throws caution to the wind and blasts away at the ladies with his automatic pistol when they refuse to help them brian catches a slug in the leg from the passenger but he kills her nocarriers is not a beer & pizza movie that you can either laugh off or laugh with because the humor is virtually non-existent by the end of this 84-minute movie our heroes have turned into villains who only care only for themselves and their plight chris pine makes quite an impression as fun-loving brian and his energetic performance is the only reason to hang with this hokum while the only other well-known actress piper perabo is relegated to an inconsequential girlfriend role as bobby she makes tragic the mistake of showing compassion to a dying little girl and pays an awful price it is a testament to pines performance that he can change his character to the point of putting himself before others essentially pine has the only role that gives him the ability to pull a one-eighty from happy-go-lucky guy to heartless guy the two directors are spanish brothers and they never let the momentum flag since there is no relief in sight carriers sinks into predictability irréversible cinematographer benoît debie does a fantastic job with his widescreen lensing and as unsavory as this road trip becomes debie makes it look like a dynamic film aside from the lack of a happy ending or closure in any sense of the word carriers suffers because it is so horribly cynical the scene when the german shepherd attacks danny conjures up the most suspense but even it could have been improved unfortunately the pastor brothers do not scare up either much tension or suspense by fade-out you really dont care what happens to anybody<SEP>0
ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel its too easy so im going to challenge myself to acknowledge the positive aspects of little man first im impressed with the special effects it really did look like marlon wayans head was attached to the body of a little person i never doubted it for a minutesecondly i loved some of the unexpected cameos david alan grier played an annoying restaurant singer and his renditions of havin my baby and movin on up were priceless john witherspoon who coincidentally played griers father in 1992s boomerang if you remember he coordinated the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket now plays vanessas father in little man so that was funbeyond that this movie is about as believable as white chicks how dumb is it when even the doctor cant tell that its a 40-year-old man and not a baby hes got a full set of teeth!!! how is it possible that no one seems to notice that its not a baby little man is so bad that theres a rob schneider cameo and please if youre stupid enough to waste $8 on this movie at least do me a favor and do not bring your children this movie is way too sexual for small children lots of jokes and innuendo about sex going down eating out etc and i felt embarrassed for the parents who brought their kids to the screening i was forced to endure if you insist on seeing an idiotic film as least spare your children the pain and suffering<SEP>0
whenever i see most reviews its called a misfire for eddie murphy these critics want to take a look at some of the stuff hes doing these days and maybe soften their stance in retrospect the golden child is not highbrow entertainment but thanks to some of the cast it breaths new life into old clichés and gives murphy one of his best roles i dont understand the pervading lack of love for its efforts at all perhaps it was released at a time when the establishment had grown weary of knockabout thrill-a-minute adventures steven spielberg started it with indiana jones; its unfair to make this one a scapegoat when what is possibly its biggest sin is also utterly harmless theres nothing necessarily wrong with trying to capitalise on trendsyes its silly but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that ridiculous is where hollywoods idea of mysticism begins and ends whats more important than believability with a story like this is that the audience have entertaining tour guides on hand to show them the mysterious sights michael ritchie and eddie murphy fit the bill for this capacity just fine my advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the ride<SEP>1
an excellent example of cowboy noir as its been called in which unemployed michael nicolas cage loses out on a job because he insists on being honest hes got a bum leg with really nothing else he can do he decides that for once hes going to lie when he walks into a bar and the owner wayne the late great jt walsh mistakes him for a hit-man whom wayne has hired to do in his sexy young wife suzanne lara flynn boyle in fine form michael plays along and accepts waynes money *then* he goes to suzanne and informs her of her husbands intentions and accepts *her* money to get rid of wayne! if that didnt complicate things enough the real hit-man lyle from dallas dennis hopper in a perfect role for him shows up and michael is in even more trouble than beforered rock west gets a lot out of the locations director john dahl who co-wrote the script with his brother rick was smart in realizing the potential of a story set in a truly isolated small town that may have seen better days and in which the residents could be involved in any manner of schemes its also an amusing idea of the kind of trouble an honest person could get into if they decided to abandon their principles and give in to any level of temptation its an appreciably dark and twist-laden story with an assortment of main characters that are if not corrupt have at least been morally compromised like michael the lighting by cinematographer marc reshovsky is superb in its moodiness; even the climax set in a graveyard lends a nice morbid quality to the whole thing even if the writing isnt particularly logical or credible the film has a nice way of intriguing the viewer and just drawing them right incage does a good job in the lead but his co-stars have a grand old time sinking their teeth into their meaty and greed-motivated characters hopper boyle and walsh are all fun to watch in these parts timothy carhart and dan shor are fine as walshs deputies in one especially good twist walsh is also the local sheriff and theres an entertaining cameo role for country & western star dwight yoakam who also graces the film with an enjoyable end credits tuneits quite a good little film worth checking out it moves forward at an impressive pace and if nothing else is certainly never boring810<SEP>1
i make just one apology for this film: there are far far too many wide angle close-ups and if they irritate you beyond endurance fair enough they drove me barmy for the first ten minutes or so but after that i made a kind of a truce with the terrible cinematography; and long before the end of the film i had ceased to care this is too rich a comedy to be destroyed so easily its hilarious its witty the comic delivery of all of the cast is flawless and however much usher peers at his characters through a cold fish-eye lens - he may not care for them much - he manages to present them with warmth `mystery men is in fact not only funnier not only more clever but also deeper than anyone seems to have given it credit for being the jokes in the austin powers movies for instance as well as being less funny than the jokes here are also much more toothless the satire of `mystery men bites when theres something worth biting and gnaws gently when there isnt it doesnt mock just any old thing which is why contrary to what some i must regard them as unobservant critics have said it never runs out of ideasthe `super heroes are an attractive bunch sure theyre second-rate but theyre not merely second rate the blue rajah for instance does nothing but throw cutlery at people and he isnt that good at it on the other hand neither is he comically bad hes better in his limited field than most people and he does practise diligently hes not a buffoon which makes him a much funnier character than if he was if superman is christ in a cape the mystery men are all the minor demigods from the foothills of mount olympus in capes much funnier; also much more endearing<SEP>1
i saw this at the mill valley film festival hard to believe this is ms bloms directorial debut it is beautifully paced and performed large cast of characters could be out of an anne tyler novel ie they are layered with back story and potential futures there are no false notes surprising bursts of humor amidst self-inflicted anxiety and very real if not earth-shattering dilemmas if you saw the best of youth you will recognize how well drawn the characters are through small moments even as the story moves briskly along i really hope this gets distribution in the usa i live in a fairly sophisticated film market yet we rarely get swedish films of any kind<SEP>1

20 out of 10 this is a truly wonderful story about a wartime evacuee and a curmudgeonly carpenter tom oakley the boy william beech is billeted with tom and it is immediately apparent that he has serious issues when he wets his bed on the first night william is illiterate and frightened but somehow the two find solace in each others loneliness it transpires that william has a talent as an artist and we see toms talent as a choirmaster in an amusing rendition of jerusalem william is befriended by zacharias wrench a young jewish lad also from london and along with both tom and zacharias he finally learns to read and write and to feel a part of this small close knit community just as he is settling down william is recalled back to london by his mother and it is here we see why he is so screwed up his mother is clearly mentally sick and when tom doesnt hear from william he travels to london to look for him he finally finds him holding his dead baby sister where he has been tied up in a cellar after a period in hospital tom realises he must kidnap him and take him home with him the climax is a bitter-sweet ending when william is told he is to be adopted by tom while at the same time learning his best friend zacharias has been killed in an air raid in london for me one of the most moving scenes was when tom was talking to a official from the home officei love im an for what its worth i think he loves me tooit just doesnt get better that that does it<SEP>1
oh a vaguely once famous actress in a film where she plays a mother to a child it`s being shown on bbc 1 at half past midnight i wonder if yup it`s a tvm you`ve got to hand it to tvm producers not content on making one mediocre movie they usually give us two mediocre movies where two themes are mixed together and nowhere to hide is no different the first theme is a woman in danger theme cross pollinated with a woman suffering from the pain of a divorce theme which means we have a scene of the heroine surviving a murder attempt followed by a scene having her son sam ask why she divorced and being a tvm she answers that the reason is that people change rather than say something along the lines like i`m a right slapper or your daddy cruises mens public toilets for sex as does happen in real life divorce cases and it`s young sam i feel sorry for not only are his parents divorced but he`s as thick as two short planks actually since he`s so stupid he deserves no sympathy because he`s unaware that a man flushing stuff down a toilet is a drug dealer unaware that you might die if someone shoots at you and unaware that i love lucy is painfully unfunny if only our own childhoods were so innocent ah well as orwell said ignorance is strength oh hold on sam is suddenly an expert on marine life ! is this character development or poor scripting i know what one my money`s on and strange that sam the boy genuis hasn`t noticed that if the story is set in 1994 then why do people often wear clothes drive cars and ride trains from the 1950s but as it turns out during a plot twist it`s the mother who`s the dummy then there`s a final plot twist that left me feeling like an idiot for watching this<SEP>0

this movie portrays ruth as a womanizing hard drinking gambling overeating sports figure with a little baseball thrown in babe ruths early life was quite interesting and this was for all intents and purposes was omitted in this film also lou gehrig was barely covered and this was a well know relationship good bad or indifferent it should have been covered better than it was his life was more than all bad he was an american hero an icon that a lot of baseball greats patterned their lives after i feel that i am being fair to the memory of a great baseball player that this film completely ignored shame on the makers of this film for capitalizing on his faults and not his greatness<SEP>0
i saw the glacier fox in the theatre when i was nine years old - i bugged my parents to take me back three times i began looking for it on video about five years ago finally uncovering a copy on an online auction site but i would love to see it either picked up by a new distributor and rereleased i understand the original video run was small or have the rights purchased by the family channel disney etc and shown regularly it is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life struggle of a family of foxes in northern japan narrated by a wise old tree the excellent soundtrack compliments the film well it would be a good seller today better than many of the weak offerings to childrens movies today<SEP>1
this film was more effective in persuading me of a zionist conspiracy than a muslim one and im jewishanbody go to journalism school read an editorial freshman year rhetoric these alarmist assertions presented in a palatable way might prove persuasive but by offering no acknowledgment of possible opposing arguments nor viable or any at all solutions few sources and each of dubious origin makes the argument an ineffectual diatribeand thank goodness for that -- i wouldnt want anyone to leave the theatre believing any of this racist claptrapa good lesson for me -- and hopefully a cautionary tale for you -- to actually read about a film before seeing it<SEP>0
if you liked the first two films then im sorry to say youre not going to like this one this is the really rubbish and unnecessary straight to video probably tv made sequel the still idiotic but nice scientist wayne szalinski rick moranis is still living with his family and he has his own company szalinski inc unfortunately his wife wants to get rid of a statue wayne is so stupid he shrinks his statue and himself with his brother then he shrinks his wife and sister-in-law too now the adults have to find a way to get the kids of the house to get them bigger pretty much a repeat of the other two with only one or two new things eg a toy car roller coaster swimming in dip etc pretty poor!<SEP>0
dont be swayed by the naysayers this is a wonderfully spooky film this was a thesis project for the writerdirector jt petty he did a great job of having me on the edge of my seat i never really knew what to expect and for a jaded horror-movie goer this is nirvana! the film concerns an elderly man who lives in a isolated log cabin in the woods one day while searching for his cat in the woods he witnesses the murder of a child or does he he agonizes about this the rest of the film what is most unusual about this film is that here is no dialogue until the last few scenes i found this to be intriguing the writer manages to get hold of your senses and gives them a relentless tug give this film a go you wont be disappointed<SEP>1
the concept of this made-for-tv horror movie is ludicrous beyond words but hey it was the late 1970s and literally all stupid horror formats were pretty damn profitable so why not exploit the idea of a satanically possessed dog the plot of devil dog is easy to describe to fans of the horror genre: simply think of the omen and replace the newborn baby boy with a nest of german shepard pups! seriously im not kidding thats what the movie is about! during the opening sequence members of some kind of satanic cult buy a female dog in heat only to have it impregnated by satan himself youd think that the lord of darkness has other things on his mind than to fornicate with a german shepard and take over the world one evil puppy at the time but apparently not exactly like little damien in the omen one of the puppies is taken in by model family and grows up to become a beautiful and charismatic animal but lucky  thats the dogs name  is pure evil and liquidates annoying neighbors and nosy school teachers in derivative and tamely executed ways he also inflicts his malignant character on the family wife and children but he cannot force the father richard crenna to stick his arm into a lawnmower because hes a chosen one the whole thing becomes too moronic for words when crenna eventually travels to ecuador to search for an ancient wall painting and gets advice from an old witchdoctor who speaks perfect english i guess he learned that living in isolation atop of a mountain his entire life director curtis harrington whats the matter with helen ruby and lead actor richard crenna wait until dark the evil desperately try to create a suspenseful and mysterious atmosphere but all is in vain scenes like cute puppy eyes spontaneously setting fire to a spanish maid or a dog dodging bullets without even moving evoke chuckles instead of frights and not even spooky musical tunes can chance that the special effects are pathetic especially near the end when the satan-dog mutates into an utterly cheesy shadow on the wall devil dog is a truly dumb movie but its definitely hilarious to watch late at night with some friends and loads of liquor there are entertaining brief cameos of martine beswick dr jekyll and sister hyde as the terrifying cult queen and rg armstrong the car the pack as the evil fruit vegetable and puppy salesman and yes that annoying daughter is the same kid who gets blown away complaining about her ice-cream in carpenters assault on precinct 13<SEP>0
yep this is definatly up there with some of the worst of the mstifyed movies but i have definately seen worse think gremlins rated r well anyway i met rick sloane at some sci-fi convention that amazingly he was lecturing at! it was one of those really low budget conventions where everything goes an everyone brought in something if you want to see crap you should have of seen what some friends and i brought inhe seemed like a very nice guy he was very cool about my questions and comments on hobgoblins and he even told me not to take it seriously and said he loved the mst3k version!all in all rick sloane knew what he was doing and i think was meant to bad like mars attacks so i guess im standing up for this movie and giving it a 5 and betraying all my fellow msties sorry guys<SEP>0
brilliant adaptation of the largely interior monologues of leopold bloom stephen dedalus and molly bloom by joseph strick in recreating the endearing portrait of dublin on june 16 1904 - bloomsday - a day to be celebrated - double entendre intended! bravo director strick screenwriter haines as well as casting director and cinematographer in creating this masterpiece gunter grass novel the tin drum filmed by volker schlöndorff 1979is another fine film adaptation of interior monologue which i favorably compare with stricks filmwhile there are clearly recognized dublin landmarks in the original novel and in the film there are also recognizable characters although with different names in the novel for example buck mulligan with whom dedalus lives turns out to be a then prominent dublin surgeon this film for all of its excellence is made even richer by additional viewings brian invinoveritas1@aolcom 15 june 2008<SEP>1
we all know a movie never does complete justice to the book but this is exceptional important characters were cut out blanca and alba were essentially mushed into the same character most of the subplots and major elements of the main plot were eliminated claras clairvoyance was extremely downplayed making her seem like a much more shallow character than the one i got to know in the book in the book we learn more about her powers and the important effects she had on so many people which in turn was a key element in the life of the family in the movie she was no more than some special lady the relationship between esteban and pedro tercero tercero-third- by the way is the son and thus comes after segundo-second- and its connections to that between esteban and his grandson from pancha garcía not son who he also did recognize is chopped in half and its importance downplayedone of the most fundamental things about the book that the film is all but stripped of: this is called the house of the spirits where is the house the story of 3-4 generations of a family is supposed to revolve around the big house on the corner a line stated so many times in the novel the house in fundamental to the story but the movie unjustly relegates it to a mere backdropif i hadnt read the book before i would have never guessed that such a sappy shallow movie could be based on such a rich and entertaining novel<SEP>0
this story was probably one of the most powerful i have ever taken in john singleton certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece brilliant performances by the whole cast but epps and rapaport turned in the best and most convincing of either young stars careerhowever as a college student myself many of the issues that singleton touched on were taken to the extreme in a sense that while they are issues faced on many college campuses they arent presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe in some instances it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur however aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic the film was brilliant and left me stunned unable to talk just think one of the things from this picture i will remember forever was a quote from lawrence fishburns character knowledge is power without knowledge you cannot see your power brilliant just brilliant<SEP>1
this movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years not even woody harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottomthe murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not nothing is of any interest the cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful i just sat in utter amazement during this movie thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining the producers of this movie were very clever they made a boring movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast people will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think woody harrison kristin scott thomas and willem dafoe this must be good and rent this movieboy are they in for a horrible timeif you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie some people actually did enjoyed this movie but i like to watch a movie with meaning<SEP>0
well i just ordered this on my pay-per-view at home because i was bored and needed a laugh i have to admit i did chuckle a few times but i dont even remember what parts they were at i dont understand why this movie was made it claims to be a comedy but seriousuly i dont find a singing penis or a naked 70 year old woman very funny this movie was trying to fit itself into the gross-out comedies of recent years such as american pie and road trip but it just failed miserably it was way to much gross-out then it was comedy also why on earth did cameron diaz attach her name to this movie!! the only thing i liked about this movie was when dave and angela were in the pool i thought it was sexy and enjoyable and well-done besides that avoid this movie 310<SEP>0
the film is poorly casted except for some familiar old hollywood names other performances by unknown names ie jennifer gabrielle are uninspiring i have seen other films by this director unfortunately this is one of his worst perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay in a positive note kim bassingers and pat moritas performance saved the movie from oblivion i enjoyed pat more in karate kid though there are many good movies to see and in short this one is not one of them save your money and the celluloid jason vanness<SEP>0
i would have liked to give this movie a zero but that wasnt an option!! this movie sucks!!! the women cannot act i should have known it was gonna suck when i saw bobby brown nobody in my house could believe i hadnt changed the channel after the first 15 minutes the idea of black females as gunslingers in the western days is ridiculous its not just a race thing its also a gender the combination of the two things is ridiculousi am sorry because some of the people in the movie arent bad actorsactresses but the movie itself was awful it was not credible as a movie it might be entertaining to a certain group of people but i am not in that group lol and using a great line from a great great moviethats all i have to say about that<SEP>0
i understand the jokes quite well they just arent good the show is horrible i understand it and thats another horrible thing about it the only cool character there ever was on the show was that one hobo in that one episode but then i see the other episode including that episode and the show is horrible its not funny not funny! i dont want people to say only smart people get it because if theyre so smart why do they judge people they dont even know and say that theyre not smart or intellectual enough to understand it its like saying the sky is red but never looking outside but anyways this is absolutely the worst show i have ever seen in my life the jokes are terrible i mean you can understand them theyre just horrible her controversy is very lame her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really dumb and usually consist of really bad acting im not sure what these smart people see in this show but judging others when they dont even know anything about any of us isnt exactly a smart comment<SEP>0
this movie strikes me as one of the most successful attempts ever at coming up with plausible answers for some of the nagging questions that have cropped up in recent scholarship concerning the passion suffering and death of christ accounts in the new testament what motivated judas if money was not the issue what could bring the sanhedrin to meet on a high holy day why did pilate waffle it is a movie for the serious thinking christian: fans of the passion of the christ will no doubt be disappointed by the lack of gory spectacle and arch characterization as for myself i find the portrait painted here--of the willingness of ordinary people to so blithely sacrifice common decency when their own self-interest is at stake--far more realistic and deeply unsettling the disinterested just doing my job look on the face of the man who drives the first nail in christs wrist is as chilling as any moment in film the film makes no claim to authenticity but the settings and costuming invariably feel more right than many more highly acclaimed efforts it is a slow film but if you accept its self-imposed limits it is after all the death--not the life--of christ ultimately a very rewarding one<SEP>1
i loved this flick when it came out in the 80s and still do! i still quote classic lines like say it again and you said youd rip my balls off sir ron leibman was hot and very funny! although it was underrated and disowned by mad i have to say that this little gem will always be a treasure of mine and a movie that i would take with me if sent to a deserted island! i only wish that someone would release the dvd because my vhs tape is about worn out! if you like cheesed out comedy this is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic! it is military humor at its best and worse! rent it if you cant own it!<SEP>1
havent seen the film since first released but it was memorable performances by rip torn and conchata farrell were superb photography excellent moving story line and everything else about it was of the highest standard yet it seems to have been pretty much forgottenmaybe because uk is an odd market for it but i havent seen the film on tv or video which is sad has it had more success in us where it might rightly be seen as a quite accurate historical dramaalways reckon that 50% of a good film is the music and though im not certain i think the title theme was a simple but moving clarinet solo of what a friend we have in jesus the film then went on to disprove that! am i right or wrong<SEP>1
intelligent wry and thrilling the invisible man stood out in 2000 among sci-fis usual lineup balancing out farscapes fantastical art direction and sometimes melodramatic script with gritty cynical plots and modern noir dialogue the show sat between law and order and doctor who on the believability meter but there was no denying the fact that i-mans characters went beyond caricature even characters that verged on predictability like the keeper the official and eberts were given reprieves from the formulaic paul ben-victor and vincent ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and shifted elegantly made even more remarkable by the revolving door team of writers and directors the effects are never allowed to overwhelm the plot and the science only sometimes verged on the totally unbelievable the shows low points are still entertaining and ive never seen such taut pilot episodes matt greenberg and sci-fi should be commended and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive dvd edition of the show every time i come across a marathon of hercules: the legendary journeys on sci-fi i roll my eyes and sigh mourning the excitement and possibility of science fiction television that invisible man and its ilk represented<SEP>1
like a latter day ayn rand bigelow is la major muy macho in her depiction in the film of a few tough american hombres stuck in iraq defusing roadside bombs set by the ruthless relentless child-killing arab terrorists as bigelow posits the iraq war as the backdrop of the grand stage of human drama one veteran bomb expert gets blown up and another shows up to replace him in the dusty hot ugly rubble that is iraq and a new hero is bornthe new guy is what john hershey described in his book and later the movie the war lover as a sadistic wingnut who actually isnt fit for civilian life and requires the stimulation of war to sublimate and suppress his errant sexual desires the war lover can only fully function in war peacetime suffocates him while hershey chastised the war lover played in the film by steve mcqueen in one of his greatest roles bigelow glorifies him the army needs war lovers they are the bulwark of defense against our enemies we cant handle the truth that it is war lovers who are the best soldiers the toughest men according to the unironic bigelow regular men are pussies the war lover is a special breed the last of the cowboys so what if he wants to bare-back his men or fondle an iraqi boy he is a throwback to the sex-and-death cult of war in war sex is a thankless loveless dont-ask dont-tell kind of male bonding bigelow has no opinion on this; she just limits the options of masculinity in this ham-fisted attempt at realism only a war-lover can win the moral struggle between right and wrong between american innocence and arab perfidy bigelow disguises her racism and arrogance behind the ingenuous facade of journalism shes just another gung-ho yahoo depicting a brutal war against civilians as a moral triumph of the spiriton the political front bigelow returns to the western genre and its relentless clichés again and again ad nauseam: the wonderful world of the open frontier which happens to be some one elses country you can shoot people here says a soldier ; the tough but human black guy companion the soldier with a premonition of death the gruff possibly crazy commanding officer the college-educated fool who tries to befriend the enemy you name it bigelow resurrects itthe man-boy love is palpable in scenes with the cute arab boy who befriends the war lover but bigelow plays it straight; she doesnt consummate the sex just sanitizes it what bigelow really wants to show us is the ugly sneering face of the arab enemy any iraqi who isnt pure evil is either demented hostile or up to no good anyway they all deserve to die for their impudence and many of them do in this glib gore-fest film the iraqi women are all hysterical they only make their presence known by screaming they could be male stunt men in drag for all i know you never see their faces there is no female presence at all on base or in battle although female casualty rates in iraq would certainly disprove thisbigelow goes through all the motions one by one she glorifies war she canonizes the sadist nut-case hero the cowboys surrounded by the subhuman indians prove their mettle by doing gods work and subduing the wretched terrorist-infested hellhole with sheer bravado and suicidal mania toward the end i felt like rooting for the indians in bigelows world though no mercy or understanding ever makes it through the iraqis are dehumanized par excellence the slaughter of civilians is just the dramatic backdrop to our heros psycho sexual struggle every us bullet finds its mark you have to love the guy the war lover its just his way he is the true hero hes just a guy trying to get things done the hard way and so what if he lusts for boy tang on the side<SEP>0
this was shown on the biography channel and was about as informative as a childrens comic! i gave it 2 out of 10 for its attention to detail because for the most part it had a 70s feel to it and the three ladies that played the original three angels looked like them so the make-up was goodthis was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was void of everything that is normally usually seen in one of their biographies no interviews with surviving cast members crew members production team members etc or their friends families and any biographers of those people in fact i know just as much now about the programme as i did before i watched this film that was based on the supposedly biographical book as for actually learning something that no-one knew about the program and wasnt common knowledge well that never happened<SEP>0

secret sunshine reminded me of the rapture 1991 with mimi rogers and david duchovny but this korean production is a better film it portrays super-religious korean christians in a provincial korean city and the main characters experiences interacting with them in the wake of a horrible personal tragedy shin-ae is a widowed single mother who moves to the city of milyang secret sunshine in chinese from seoul with her young son she has chosen milyang because her late husband killed in an auto accident was born there and she feels she needs to make a new start in life in a new place she does not react well to the overtures of the local christian zealots one of whose members tries to convince her to come to their church and prayer meetings shin-ae is essentially irreligious and brushes these people off as politely as she can in fact she brushes just about everyone in milyang off to begin with but some of them are persistent in trying to invade her world and the consequences are often hilarious to say more would be to give the film away but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the lead role jeon do-yeon is stupendous having read that she won the best actress award at cannes in 2007 i expected her to a decent job but ms jeon is captivating and it is impossible to take your eyes off her when she is on screen the movie is a sort of harrowing evelyn waugh-esquire piece of work showing how fate can feel insane as much as strangely inevitable<SEP>1
ok so it may not be the award-winning movie of the year type-film apart from the brilliant soundtrack that i think won a few awards but it is a really great film about the kid prince o take your pick and the happenings around him living in minneapolis playing his music the music is absolutely superb in my opinion you have to own this soundtrack it is truly a classic and sums up the eighties sounds and feel in a wonderful fashion and the movie itself plays out a nice plot its worth seeing over and over again espeically if you like prince o which i do of course<SEP>1
a young boy sees his mother getting killed and his father hanging himself 20 years later he gets a bunch of friends together to perform an exorcism on himself so he wont turn out like his father all the stock characters are in place: the nice couple; the funny guy; the tough but sensitive hood; the smart girl she wears glasses--thats how we know; the nerd and two no-personality blondes it all involves some stupid wooden statue that comes to life dont ask and kills people i knew i was in trouble when after a great opening scene we jump to 20 years later--all bad horror movies do that!the dialogue is atrocious the acting is bad except for betsy palmer--why betsy and the killings are stupid andor unimaginative my favorite scene is when two people are supposedly having sex and the statue knocks the guy off the bed to show hes fully dressed! a real bad stupid incoherent horror film avoid at all costs<SEP>0
this review applies for the cut of the film thats generally available as fury of the wolfman i understand there is an uncut version out there with additional footage and i would hope that it contained at least eight or nine crucial scenes that seem to be missing from the cut known as fury of the wolfman in short the movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever it is utter nonsense and incomprehensible nonsense at thatwaldemar daninsky that venerable lycanthropic antihero portrayed by paul naschy in a seemingly endless series of films is apparently a normal guy who has just come back from a trip to tibet where he was attacked by a yeti somehow this has turned him into a werewolf daninsky is a doctor a scientist and an instructor at what appears to be a college one of his female colleagues ilona elmann is involved in a vague form of hypnosischematodes a nonsense word used to refer to a bunch of wires attached to a victims head ellman feels this will enable her to change the direction of the human brain naturally enabling her to rule the world provided she can get us all attached to those wires with no troubleelmann is also into werewolves because she kidnaps daninsky and takes him to her hidden laboratory she has a bunch of other people trapped there as well some of them look like gypsies and are chained up being in varying states of lucidity others are clearly hippies elmann feels that one day she may be able to help them be human again but in the meantime she controls them with her chematodes waldemar becomes her hairy hit man wandering around like a werewolf zombie--that is until the filmmakers decide to use footage spliced in from another naschy werewolf film frankensteins bloody terror dont ask at which point naschys werewolf makeup changes considerably and he lurches around like an animalis this making any sense no good thats the films saving grace it doesnt try and engage you on any kind of intellectual level it just goes full speed ahead with whatever nonsense dialogue or cheap horror movie sets it can muster up fury of the wolfman may be the best halloween party movie ever you absolutely do not need to pay attention to it and in fact if you do you will be completely confused<SEP>0
roommates sugar and bobby lee are abducted by menacing dudes while out shopping one day and taken back to a secluded island that the girls reluctantly tell the thugs that they last visited when they were ten years of age and that a fortune is located on all that just pretty much bookends a movie that is pretty much one long flashback about the girls first visit to the island and subsequent fight with a cannibalistic familythis one is extremely horribly acted by everyone involved to the point that i started feeling bad for poor hank worden who truly deserved much much better as much as i didnt like barracuda thats on the same dvd i have to admit that this film makes that one look like citizen kaneeye candy: one pair of tits they might belong to kirsten baker my grade: f dark sky dvd extras: vintage ads for various drive-in food; and trailers for bonnies kids features nudity the centerfold girls part-time wife features nudity psychic killer & eaten alive the dvd also comes with 1978s barracuda<SEP>0
this is one of the worst movies i have seen this year you should not see this movie but if you insist on wasting your time you should stop here there are spoilers gray matters centers on gray and sam baldwin heather graham and tom cavanagh only gray and sam are brother and sister; living together in everyone elses eyes as man and wife no sex but just about everything else early on the movie starts with its theme: the most absurd thing at the most absurd moment with you guessed it the most absurd reactions gray and sam decided to check out the dog park with a borrowed pooch rather then push her brother to get the skinny on first woman they see for him she does it and gets to the nitty-gritty questions too when she signals her brother to come over they start a 3-way date charlie bridget moynahan is the girl of their dreams like all the right things etc sam final hits gray over the head and the couple finishes the date with a marriage proposal! that charlie accepts! in one week charlie gray and sam are to be in vegas in the next week charlie and gray are off shopping for wedding gowns apparently charlie has an off-the-rack figure gray is slurping an iced latte when charlie suggests gray tries on some gowns as well and picks out a $10000 frock for her while charlie is zipping her in this down-payment-on-a-house gown gray continues to slurp on the latte i swear it was like a feed bag what should happen but woops! latte all over the gown it is never explained how they got out of bloomingdales bridal salon with out a $10000 mocha colored gown back to reality  caesars palace las vegas they have the high roller room sam is a resident surgeon and charlie is an intern zoologist  were do they get all this money gray kicks sam out to the single room down the hall so she and charlie can have a bachelorette drink-a-thon were you guessed it - they kiss gray remembers everything; charlie remembers nada they make it to wedding chapel and right when the reverend gets to his line if there is anybody is here who has any objection whatsoever to the union of these two lovebirds gray gets the hiccups gray excuses herself for some reason the reverend must repeat his last line and right on queue again hiccups gray gets back to ny and starts dating any man she meets literally and of course one is you guessed it again! gay the other is a jerk and the third is a taxi cab driver alan cummings named gordy he is smittened with gray but the feelings are not returned they become great friends this is good because when she comes clean with sam about the kiss he blows up and kicks her out of their apartment when sam comes to his senses he goes to her office gray works at an ad agency this office is smack in the middle of the twilight zone it has cameras and microphones in all the conference rooms that broadcast to all computer monitors at the agency sam gets gray in one of the conference rooms for a not-so-private conversation and ends up outing her to the entire office this is where i doubt that there was a gay man or lesbian on the crew: gordy comes to her rescue and convinces her to go to a lesbian bar sorry no men says the bouncer so gray and gordy return with gordy in drag bad drag he was in a sleeveless black satin-like blouse a string of pearls and a grandmas church hat no lesbian would ever confuse this man in a dress as a drag queen much less a woman the bar was also the straight mans fantasy of what a lesbian bar is: full of victorias secret models everything turns out peachy  she goes home with her firms client gray happens to be on the womans account and finally does more then kiss for some reason no one tells charlie anything and she is oblivious through the whole movie of this kiss with gray but that is for the sequel<SEP>0
i can find very little thats good to say about this film i am sure the idea and script looked good on paper but the filmography and acting i am afraid is not the standards i would expect from some very talented people i would doubt that this features highly in their cv filmography michael caine appeared wooden at times in his role as the doctor and at no time no did i actually believe in his character the plot was unbelievable especially with regard to the victims son some of the scenes were very reminiscent of other films that at times i wondered if it was actually a spoof thriller the lighting at times was dark and this added to the feeling of watching a low budget movie with some big named stars wondering why i bothered to watch it at all<SEP>0
despite having 6 different directors this fantasy hangs together remarkably wellit was filmed in england nowhere near morocco in studios and on a few beaches at the outbreak of war everything was moved to america and some scenes were filmed in the grand canyonnotable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song - i want to be a bandit cant you understand it it remains a favourite of many people<SEP>1
holes was a great movie disney made the right choice every person who i have talked to about it said they loved it everyone casted was fit for the part they had and shia labeouf really has a future with acting sigourney weaver was perfect for the warden she was exactly how i imagined her everyone who hasnt seen it i recommend it and i guarantee you will dig it<SEP>1

jeremy brett is simply the best holmes ever narrowly edging out the great basil rathbone of course and this is probably the best adaptation of a conon-doyle short storya length adaptation includes some new plot strands that fit in well to the surrounding drama and heightens the hatred one feels for milvertonexcellent performances all round especially from robert hardy and both brett and hardwick fully rounded and comfortable in their roles makes this a superb piece of drama<SEP>1

wow! this film is the best living testament i think of what happened on 9-11-01 in nyc compared to anything shown by the major media outletsthose outlets can only show you what happened on the outside this film shows you what happened on the inside it begins with a focus on a rookie new york fireman waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight the subject matter turns abruptly with the only existing footage of the first plane to hit the towers you are then given a front-row seat as firefighters rush to the scene into the lobby of tower one in the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane and tower twos subsequent fall you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby it is a sight you will not soon forgetheart-rending tear-jerking and very compelling from the first minute to the last 911 deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever madewe must never forget<SEP>1
this reminded me of spinal tap on a more serious level its the story of a band doing a reunion tour but things are not harmonious between them i was especially impressed with the performance of bill nighy as ray you felt sorry for him yet he had a certain creepiness about him its a great movie to watch if you have ever seen your favorite band get wrinklyold and patheticbittersweet highly recommended<SEP>1
i have seen some bad movies austin powers - the spy who shagged me batman forever but this film is so awful so boring that i got about half way through and could not bear watching the rest a pity boasting talent such as kenneth branagh embeth davitz and robert duvall and a story by john grisham what went wrong branagh is a big-time lawyer who has a one-night fling with davitz her father duvall is a psychopath who hanged her cat etc etc so branagh has him sent to a nuthouse and he promptly escapes somehow i couldnt figure out how robert downey jr daryl hannah famke janssen and tom berenger are all mixed into the story which moves slower than stationary i wanted to like this and being a huge grisham fan have read all about this movie and i foolishly expected something interesting this is honestly the worst film ive seen to date and i wish i could have my money refunded * out of *****<SEP>0
i think it was ebert who gave stella four out of four stars but other than his i have never read a positive review of this sadly misunderstood drama about class divisions love and sacrifice three themes most great romantic stories or films have in commonhere the major theme is class division stella is a story from depression era america that said it was translated to the screen then in such a memorable fashion that this remake if you ask a stanwyck fan or two was not exactly appreciated fans of the original never gave it a chance furthermore this version of stella was made in the 1990s not exactly a time of great financial trouble in america as the depression wasnow is the time to remove the rosy-coloured glasses in the midst of a new era of recession and poverty in america and see that this powerful story still rings true is as timely and relevant as ever in its updated formatyes class divide is the major theme here stella is among the working poor single with big dreams but little hope of realizing those dreams she works in a bar doesnt have much money lives in a crummy apartment you get the drift in the morning she doesnt really want to get out of bed on her wall pictures of movie stars she idolizesa man sees her dance at the bar hes wealthy educated from one of those upper class families that has nothing in common with stellas his major concern is what ivy league college to attend hers is how to pay the rent how to be happy they have an affair they like each other stella ends up pregnant stella tells the guy the news his response how about an abortion she replies i just wanted a room full of balloons he supplies the balloons and the proposal but she sees his heart is not in it and has too much pride to accept she sends him packingher daughter is eventually torn between the two lifestyles--the love she has for her mom and the advantages and happiness and love held out to her by her wealthy father stella alone and unloved and not wanting her daughter to become as unhappy as her someday makes the ultimate sacrifice she gives up the only love and happiness she has ever known to ensure the happiness of her daughter and perhaps live vicariously and with hope knowing that at least her daughter found something to live fornow for the movie everything is right about it beautiful score artful cinematography great set design contrast between the two lifestyles; the messy apt and the decorated mansions wonderful and heartfelt performances by the whole cast with bette midler in particular oscar-worthythis is a film which is much more significant and well-made than youve been led to believe<SEP>1
this movie was like a bad indie with a-list talent the plot was silly all the way to the end it reminded me very much of something churned out for the home video market in the 1980s i would have given it a one but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really really straining to make this worthwhile i think the worst thing was the underwater scenes held off of the dock the underwater lighting seemed to come from no were and whenever someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of air this air tank would kind of appear i would avoid this unless there is nothing else on the shelf good day<SEP>0
arnold once again in the 80s demonstrated that he was the king of action and one liners in this futuristic film about a violent game show that no contestant survives but as the tag line says arnold has yet to play! the movie begins in the year 2019 in which the world economy has collapsed with food and other important materials in short supply and a totalitarian state has arisen controlling every aspect of life through tv and a police state its most popular game show is the running man in which criminals are forced to survive against stalkers that live to kill themthe movie opens with ben richards arnold leading a helicopter mission to observe a food riot in progress he is ordered by his superiors to fire on them refusing to gets him knocked out and thrown in prison in the meantime they slaughtered the people without his help the government blames richards for the massacre earning him the name butcher of bakersfield eighteen months later richards along with two friends william laughlin koto and harold weiss mcintyre breakout of a detention zone they worked in they make their way to the underground led by mic mick fleetwood mic quickly identifies richards as the butcher of bakersfield and refuses to help him but his friends convince him otherwise they want him to join the resistance but hed rather go live with his brother and get a job soon he finds that his brother has been taken away for reeducation and a woman name amber mendez alonso has taken his apartment knowing who he is she wont help him but he convinces her but is busted at the airport by the cops after she ratted him outmeantime the running man is having trouble finding good new blood for the there stalkers to kill damon killian dawson the shows host and one of the most powerful men in the country sees richards escape footage and is able to get him for the show after his capture richards refuses to play killian threatens to use his friends instead of him so he signs the contract youll love that part but soon he finds they will join him as well and makes sure killian knows hell be back the runners begin to make there way through the zones and fight characters that are memorable sub-zero buzz saw and many others eventually richards is joined by amber who suspected he was set up but was caught and thrown into the game too together they find the underground and make there way back to killian and give him a farewell send offthe running man is another one of arnolds great movies from the 80s the movie was apparently somewhat based on stephen kings book of the same name some have said that the book is better im sure its not and i dont care anyway i loved the movie as in all of arnolds films the acting is what you would expect with classic one liners from arnold and even ventura gets a couple in but without a doubt richard dawson is the standout in this film being a real game show host he easily spoofed himself and was able to create a character that was truly cold blooded the whole movie itself somewhat rips on game shows and big brother watching you keep an eye out for them poking fun and some old shows hate boat among others also the cast was great besides arnold koto and alonzo dont forget professor toru tanaka jim brown ventura and sven-ole! with all the reality tv nonsense that goes on it almost fits in better now but im sure the hollywood liberals would make it into a movie about the evil bush the new dvd had mostly poor extras meet the stalkers being the only redeemable one some how the aclu managed to get some of there communism into the dvd and is laughable garbage that should not be anywhere near an arnold movie of all things blasphemy! overall for any arnold fan especially we who grew up in the 80s on him you cant miss this its one of the first ones i saw back in the 80s and its still great to this day the futuristic world and humor are great overall 10 out 10 stars definitely one of his best<SEP>1
i am a huge fan of vonneguts work and im very fond of this movie but i wouldnt say that this is a film of the mother night that i read when people say that vonnegut is unfilmable two things come to my mind one is that many of his themes are very near the knuckle or even taboo despite the accusation sometimes used against him that he chooses relatively easy targets for his satire this means less every day that passes as far as filmability is concerned directors these days appear to revel in breaking taboos and i have high hopes for the version of bluebeard now in production amazing to think that an innocent piece like vonneguts sirens of titan would probably have been the equivalent of r rated if filmed when it was published back in the 50s for its violence language and sexual and thematic content though its a tragedy that nobodys come up yet with a filmable script for it and in the present economic climate i also hope some director out there is looking closely at jailbird galapagos and hocus pocusthe other thing is his narrative style heaping irony upon irony upon irony but still making it hilariously funny it seems impossible to objectify and that appears to be the biggest obstacle to making great films of his great novels because the little authorial comments that colour our response as readers are just not possible in movies without resorting to too often clumsy techniques like talkovers vonnegut suggested that there was a character missing from filmed versions of his work himself as authornarrator to its credit breakfast of champions the movie tried to keep the comedy and came a bit of a cropper for its pains as did another turkey made from a vonnegut novel slapstick in an even more spectacular waystill theres nothing wrong with a director giving us his subjective interpretation of vonnegut and mother night is an excellent example of how as another reviewer put it a good director can add a visual poetry to a source like this but so much of the humour is lost that though its the same plot its not really from the same novel i read if it had been id probably have been rolling in the aisles laughing a few times watching it for a reader of the novel i think a chuckle even at the end is forgivable the end of the film however is truly poignant and i think one of the films successes is that it can genuinely leave you feeling that youve watched someone walk a razors edge between good and evil and the jury is still outstanding alone and of itself its well worth a look technically there are some minor but glaring errors notably in continuity and it too often looks drab and theatrical but most of the time it hits an acceptable note and occasionally shows considerable imagination and resourcefulness the acting in general is of a high order even if maybe the dialogue is by todays standards a little stiltedit survives quite well watching back to back with slaughterhouse-5 and there is actually quite a bit more good filmed vonnegut out there mostly versions of his short stories - harrison bergeron who am i this time and some other things like of course the misfiring filmed version of his very funny but disposable play happy birthday wanda june also there was an interesting piece if it still exists done in the 70s called between time and timbuktu which vonnegut apparently didnt like much although he was involved in its production because he felt it misinterpreted him in its generality he said it reminded him of the bizarre surgical experiments performed in the hg wells tale the island of dr moreau but it did for many people serve as an excellent introduction to his workbut if the films dont make you want to go to the superior source material theyre not doing their jobas the man said more or less the big show is inside your head<SEP>1
presque rien is a story of two young boys falling in love during summer stay by the seaside i dont want to tell the plot because its not whats most important about this film but you can be sure that its interesting and original the best part of this movie is the cinematography the visual side of presque rien is so amazing it deserves highest note it leaves you charmed with its beautyas for the plot it is shown in uneven rather complicated way there is no simple chronology nor there are answers to all the questions the film brings but this is what makes presque rien even more interesting i recommend this movie to all the people for whom the artistic side of films is very important and they will not be disappointed<SEP>1
i didnt expect much from this but i have to admit i was rolling on the ground laughing a few times during this film if you are not grossly offended in the first ten minutes this might be a film for you ditto if you are the type that would enjoy watching amanda peet shuffling cards for an hour and a half its certainly not a momentous work of comedy but given the low-budget indy genesis this is masterful to level the playing field for comparison imagine all of the studio films with their budgets slashed by a factor of 100 or so and see what you get! kudos to peter cohen and his network for seeing this through i look forward to his next effort<SEP>1
this is it this is the one this is the worst movie ever made ever it beats everything i have never seen worse retire the trophy and give it to these peopletheres just no comparisoneven three days after watching this for some reason i still dont know why i cannot believe how insanely horrific this movie iswas its so bad so far from anything that could be considered a movie a story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existencethis made me question whether or not humans are truly put on this earth to do good it made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe this type of movie sincerely hurts us as a society we should be ashamed i really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good its an embarrassment i dont know how on earth any of these actors writers or the director of this film sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in making loaded i dont know what type of disgusting monsters enjoy watching these types of moviesthat being said i love a good bad movie i love shark attack 3 i love bad taste they are hilarious i tell all my friends to see them because they are badbut thisthis crosses the line of bad into a whole new dimension this is awkward bad this is the bad where you know everything that is going to happen every line every action every death every sequence before they happen; and not just like a second or two before i mean like after watching the first 5 minutes beforeevery cheesy editing effect is shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point i really never want to see the shaky camera drug buzz rush effect or jump cuts or swerve cuts or any fancy cut ever again ever this is meticulously boring repetitive and just tortures the audiencebutand let me be specific here the most disturbing thing about this movie is that given the production it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money was actually put into this excrement i personally will grab the shoulders of the director if i ever see him and shake him into submission demanding that he run home and swallow two-gallons of drain-o or i will do it for himif we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for our war prisoners abroad just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again trust me i think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the 72nd time of sitting through thisstop these movies they are just the most vile of all facets of our society please stop now<SEP>0
i dont think this is too bad of a show under the right conditions i tolerated the first seasonunfortunately this is a show about lawyers who arent really lawyers god forbid anybody actually go to law school based on these shows which i had heard was the case when i watched some interviews of the show it just made me gag a bitthat aside spader and shatner who are supposed to be the stars of the show are the most annoying while this might be a compliment in some situations its certainly not here their constantly harassing the women on the show is funny at first but since thats what theyre doing literally all the time ive realized that this is as deep as the show is going to get trying to intersperse some serious dramatic and even tear-jerking moments in the middle of this mockery of a real show fails to compensate for the progressive loss of interest ive been experiencing trying to enjoy the showalan shores flamboyant and gratuitous public service announcements where he spouts off his opinions do not impress denny crane is just annoying i was embarrassed for him and for the writers of the show for cranes speech wearing a colonial outfitim giving two stars because there are moments where i thought the shows attempts to deal with some contemporary issues were done with carei think the shows writers became aware that the sexual harassment displayed by denny and alan was getting overbearing even to those who were more inviting of them from the start the thing is i dont care if the sexual harassment treatment in the show is done well but i just felt that the writer was insulting me with artificially implanting sexual banters all over the show in the hopes that my libido will keep me coming back for more im not a teenager anymore and i think this show is promising if its goal wasnt to cater to the lowest common denominator to get ratingsof course im writing this after i realized that its really not gonna get much better than this its a shame because its one of those shows id love to love<SEP>0
another great movie by costa-gavras its a great presentation of the situation is latin america and the us involvement in latin american politics the facts might or might not be accurate but it is a fact that the us was deeply involved in coups and support of latin american dictatorshipsdespite this though the spirit of the movie follows the typical leftistcommunist propaganda of the cold war era costa-gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer and his movies are always biased for example he presents the us actions as brutal and inhumane while representing tupamaros extremist activities as something positiveas it turned out it was a blessing for uruguay and the rest of the latin america that the us got involved europe is filled with poor east european prostitutes i never heard of poor uruguayan or chilean girls prostituting themselves en masse as it happens in most east european countries the us was fighting a dirty war and god bless us all the monster of soviet communism was defeated it is unfortunate the us had to do what it did in latin america and elsewhere but sometimes you need to play dirty this is not an idealistic world as costa-gavras and matamoros like to believe had matamoros come to power in uruguay we wouldve had another ukraine in latin americaall in all this movie follows corrupt and bankrupt leftist ideology of times past and tries to pass it as idealistic and morally correct<SEP>0
cute and playful but lame and cheap munchies is another gremlins clone to come out from the 80s im not much of a fan of the imitationsfirst it was the excellent gremlinsthen came the very average critterslets not forget the lousy ghouliesbut the complete pits would have to go to hobgoblinsis there more now munchies for me would have to fall somewhere between ghoulies and hobgoblins actually i probably found it more entertaining than ghoulies but i preferred thst ones darker tone from the get-go it plays up its goofy nature which its better for it but due to that nature the hammy acting alix elias and charlie phillips can get rather overbearing that you rather just see the munchies running amok thats where the fun occurs mostly light-hearted fluff though as the story mainly centres on the munchies who are either hungry horny and destructive in a whole bunch of supposed comical encounters some moments do work in the small desert town as a couple of people are on the chase its silly but strangely engaging thanks to the zippy pacing the creatures themselves look rather bland and poorly detailed as theyre basic dolls being chucked about where their personalities arrived from is that they can actually speak and with attitudecharlie stratton and a feisty nadine van der velde who was in critters were fair leads harvey korman was acceptable in two roles robert picardo also pops upamusingly low-cut entertainment for the undemanding<SEP>0
for movie fans who have never heard of the book shirley jacksons the haunting of hill house and have never seen the 1963 robert wise production with julie harris this remake will seem pretty darn badfor those of us who have it is just plain awfulbad acting what was neeson thinking goofy computer enhancements and a further move away from jacksons story doom this remakedo yourself a favor and rent the original movie it still effectively scares without hokey special effects the acting is professional and believablefor readers of the book the from 1963 follows the it much closer<SEP>0
up until the sixth and last episode of the star wars saga which finally ended in 2005 i had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series the varied action scenes and really different characters jabba the hut furry woodland creatures etc made this a particularly appealing movienone of the action ever focused too long in one spot either the last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between luke skywalker and darth vaderanother nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars gone was the incessant bickering between carrie fisher and harrison ford finally everyone was on the same page! it was nice to seein the end this was simply a wonderful adventure tale more than anything else<SEP>1

when you see this movie you begin to realise what a drastically under-utilised asset the late dudley moore was there should be a dozen movies like this in our archivehe was already top-notch talent before he went to hollywood both as a comedian and a musician but mostly he is remembered for his pairing with peter cook on television and in one or two indifferent british movies perhaps the best of these was bedazzled he always tended to be eclipsed by cook whos jealousy and meanness rifted their partnership and enabled moore to realise his true potential in america arthur is the result this is a truly splendid movie moores clownish comedy as a drunkard is undeniable the script is perfectly suited to his manner with lots of hilarious almost surreal conversational digressions there is something so british about him that im actually surprised he found such an appeal to american tastes tommy cooper an anarchic comedian after the same fashion tended to draw a blank it is moores almost childish vulnerability that is so endearingliza minelli and john guilgud tend to play straight roles against him but still have some excellent one-liners john guilgud in particular delivers his with a sarcastic and acerbic authority that is a treasure to watch he invariably steals any scene in which he features and thoroughly deserved his oscar correct me if im wrong but he has never played any other comic rolethere is a follow-up movie called arthur 2 - on the rocks it never attains the same sublime levels of fun that this one reaches but it is still rather good even so guilgud only gets a cameo appearance at the beginning and as a ghost it is darker and there is some interesting soul-searching it will disappoint if you watch arthur firsthollywood seemed to loose interest in cuddly dudley after these two outings he eventually returned to britain dejected and apparently dyingbut arthur is a sample of what might have been we can only imagine the other great movies he should have madeyourre sadly missed dudley<SEP>1
billed as a kind of sequel to the full monty about unemployed men in sheffield this movie is a fakeas someone born in sheffield and still with links to the city i was extremely disappointed by this film someone said it could have been set in oklahoma and that just about sums it up for me this looked like a romantic view of northern england made for the us market probably many americans - and many southern english people - dont realize that sheffield is a big city of around half a million inhabitants with a sophisticated urban culture in among giants it was depicted as some dreary dead-end semi-rural small town where everyone in sheffield seemed to drink in the same old-fashioned pub and where the peoples idea of a party was line-dancing in some village-hall lookalike this was a small close-knit community not a metropolitan citythe working-class sheffield men were totally unlike their real-life counterparts who are generally taciturn and communicate with each other in grunts and brief dry remarks they dont chatter and they certainly dont sing in choirseven the rural settings supposedly in the peak district looked alien to me i recognized a few places where i used to go hiking but some of the aerial shots of pylons stretching out over a bleak landscape reminded me more of wales indeed in the credits at the end i spotted a reference to gwynedd wales the peak district is in the summer crawling with walkers and tourists in cars it is situated between two big cities it is not some kind of wildernessas for the notion that a young woman could fall in love with and lust after pete postlethwaite that was ludicrous and could only have been a male dream her reasons for becoming his lover were never made apparent none of the men was shown as having a partner or families; they existed in a vacuumanyone wanting to see a film about unemployed sheffielders would have been led astray this sheffield existed only in the minds of its middle-class writers and film-makersit was a gigantic fake!<SEP>0
beautiful film pure cassavetes style gena rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress dealing with success aging lonelinessand alcoholism she tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts embodied by the death spectre of a young girl acceptance of oneself of human condition though its overall difficulties is the real purpose of the film the parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling: its like if the stage became a way out for the heroin if all american movies could only be that top-quality dealing with human relations on an adult level not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings one of the best dramas ever 1010<SEP>1
this film is justly famous as one of the most horrible examples of propaganda ever produced the insistent equation of jews with disease is simplypathological and even worse it almost becomes believable for brief secondsthrough its sheer repetition the fact that something this crude works evenbriefly is an object lesson in itself you have to have a strong stomach and a firm grip on yourself to sit through this and i wouldnt recommend trying unless you have a good reason<SEP>0
ive seen many of guy maddins films and liked most of them but this one literally gave me a headache john gurdebekes editing is way too frenetic and apart from a tour-de-force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object does nothing but interfere with the actors ability to communicate with the audienceanother thing i disliked about this film was that it seemed more brutal than maddins earlier works--though his films have always had dark elements his sympathy for the characters gave the movies an overriding feeling of humanity this one seemed more like harshness for harshness sakeas im required to add more lines of text before imdb will accept my review i will mention that the actor playing guy maddin does manage to ape his facial expressions pretty well<SEP>0
how can such good actors like jean rochefort and carole bouquet could have been involved in such a a well such a thing i cant get it it was awful very baldy played but some of the few leading roles the jokes are dumb and absolutely not funny i wont talk more about this movie except for one little piece of advice : do not go see it it will be a waste of time and money<SEP>0
first off im not here to dog this movie i find it totally enjoyable in spite of the poor production quality the acting herein is about as abominable as the monster stalking them although the monster itself is quite well doneimpressively well done at that he actually looks kind of other-worldly like an alien family on vacation landed in the himalayas and while dad was out taking a attending to natures call spot got loose and they just didnt have time to hunt him down that or hes the caucasian brother of the wishmaster i havent decided whichactually this seems to have been filmed somewhere in snow country yes but more likely canada somewhere than china anywhere the trees and vistas say canada to me and its okay that the set area never takes on the look or feel of uber-coldness one might expect to find in the himalayas of china its a sci-fi channel movie so we can forgive the lack of locationfurther apparently as we have just established sci-fi directors do not travel often as they are not aware that commercial planes fly above weather like what is featured herein and the subsequent crash actually would not have happened but as i said its a sci-fi channel movie so we must forgive a few thingsthe movie is pretty graphic at times and rotates between alive about the donner party predator about the alien in the woods and any bad wushu movie where they fly about on wires the yeti apparently can leap about like spidermanor super marioremember run faster! jump higher! live longer! also the yeti has missed his teddy bear hes searched high and low for it but cannot seem to make a cadaver work poor yeti! you cant help but feel sorry for it it has survived and evolved thousands of years only to succumb to severe teddy bear loss hes missed his bear or maybe it wants to mate but that thought is banished! do ya hear me well it does seem to be an unmated male rebanished! and its superhuman well its not humanits super-yeti! but then again whats normal-yeti i dont know but he has a definite michael meyers quality that is completely unsettling and hes got this fabulous way of cleaning his fur fabulous dahlink! its spotlessly white at times when it so shouldnt be hes fastidiously superhu-super-yetiall in all this was a lot of fun to watch has some great kills and a few honest plot elements in spite of the horribly gravel-like production style this is actually quite entertaining i cant help wondering if theyre planning on another one it rates a 6010 on the m4tv scaleit rates a 4410 on the movie scale fromthe fiend :<SEP>0

as a turkish man now living in sweden i must confess i often watch scandinavian movies most if them i never understand i think actors from scandinavia work best in hollywood last week i watched a film called the polish wedding together with a polish friend of mine and we both said it was the worst movie we ever watched unfortunately i was wrong this movie house of angels is even worse none of the actors can act absolutely not the female so called star helen bergstrom the plot is so silly nobody can believe iti think the whole thing is a mess from the start lots of bad acting except from selldal and wollter ahmed sellam<SEP>0
this movie is a gem because it moves with soft but firm resolutioni caution viewers that although it is billed as a corporate spy thriller and ms liu is there it moves at a deftly purposeful yet sedate pace its not about explosions car chases or flying bullets you must be patient and instead note the details here its sedate because thats what the main character is the viewer has to watch him and think as this story unfoldsi will not give spoilers-- because that destroys the point of watching the plot is what youve read from the other postings: an average white-collar guy seeking change and adventure signs on for a corporate spy job just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside data take it from therethis movie starts at a surreal walk-- with a background tang of corporate disillusionment that entwines itself with quintessential underlying suburban paranoiathen it begins to acceleratethe acting on all parts is superb-- and yes some of the acts are caricature characters but they all fit and they entertain and the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as the soft soft key sinister theme: all is not right at the beginningand at the end: all is not what it seemsget comfortable and turn the lights down to watch this one-- and turn up the sound: this movie wants you to listen<SEP>1
distortion is a disturbing haunting film about life imitating art and art reflecting life haim bouzaglo the director of the film plays the role of haim bouzaglo artistically blocked and sexually impotent playwright who finds inspiration in his suspicions about the subject of his girl friends documentary as an arab suicide bomber disguised in skullcap and american t-shirt wanders through the landscape in search of his target and his nerves haim transcribes his girl friends life as she films her documentary and incorporates himself and his actors lives during rehearsals but the bomber has already struck and haim has left the restaurant just minutes earlier despite the manipulation of time and space the story is crystal clear comprehensive and absorbing a brilliant commentary on the distortion of everyday israeli life where the political is intertwined with the personal where everyone lives on the edge and people never know whether they are playing leading roles in their own lives or are merely dispensable bit players in someone elses dramatic narrativebouzaglo plays with this notion of everyone being an actor in someone elses production brilliantly we are always voyeurs seeing what the fictional director sees illicitly but also what the real director chooses to reveal to remind us that these glimpses are violations of privacy bouzaglo takes us into the bathroom and the bedroom sometimes the bedroom is the street and rooftop and repeatedly frames his views within tv video or security screens actors play the role of actors who represent the real characters played by actors of course each of the actors is the star of his or her own production only dimly aware of their diminished roles in their fellow actors personal films the detective hired by the playwright becomes a character in the play the actor hired to play the role of the detective seeks out the detective for tips on how to play the role is caught by the detective on surveillance tapes and they attend a cast party as their real selvesdespite this multiplicity of views there is no mistaking the clear lines of this narrative: the playwright searches for subject matter the bomber seeks a target and the detective stalks the filmmaker nor is there any difficulty locating bouzaglos ultimate targetenervated and impotent israel fully conscious of the threatening peril but incapable of meaningful action israel is bouzaglo the impotent fictional playwright cannibalizing his own life for his play israel is also the bankrupt soldier-entrepreneur who is the subject of the filmmakers documentary the cheating actors and actresses and the cuckolded husband they are all israel because they are all helpless caught in inaction or aimless action as the bomber scans the landscape for his best target all the characters can do as another bombing is reported is have sex and keep score of victimsthere is personal triumph vindication perhaps revenge at the end of this play within a story within a film but viewers will be left aching for the state of israel even as they are filled with admiration for bouzaglos memorable rendition of a nations plight within the telling of an individuals story<SEP>1
i thought watching employment videos on corporate compliance was tedious this movie went nowhere fast what could have been a somewhat cheesy half hour twilight zone episode turned into a seemingly endless waste of film on people parking their cars a picture of some dudes swimming pool he really needs to answer his phone by the way a dot matrix printer doing its job and heuy and louey sitting in a yellow lighted control room repeating t minus 10 and counting as if something exciting is going to happen it doesnt so dont get your hopes up the best thing about this movie is to see james best and gerald mcc in something other than there famous tv personalities and that is stretching to find anything good and do not get me started on the music which was totally composed of a tympani some large marine mammals and microphone feedback this movie is as close as i have given a one yet but it gets the 2 because i actually was able to finish this insomnia cure and didnt have to leave in the middle avoid at all costs<SEP>0
i can just about understand why some people might wish to stress this films link with the eighties but i really wouldnt say its an accurate depiction of most peoples lives in that era - even on the poorest bradford estates it is however typical of the blunt agitprop rubbish the dear old royal court theatre was churning out at that time plenty of right-on artistry for small small audiences but enough well-connected backslapping to ensure future commissions for turgid playrights ithe simple fact is that if you want to reflect upon truer common experience youll find millions more nodding in knowing agreement to love and live as depicted in gregorys girl i would be tempted to call this a kitchen sink drama but that would be doing a great disservice to the plumbing industry however as far as having a decent script is concerned this film is indeed all washed up for some reason it has accrued an odd following amongst guardian reading film-goers - i can only assume they get a visual frisson out of pretending to slum it steer clear my friends it is a poor film with a poor script that likes to think it is breaking boundaries by adding humorous insights into grim life on the estates it isntbut it is grim do the washing up instead<SEP>0
new york city houses one man above all others the possibly immortal dr anton mordrid mordrid is the sworn protector of humanity using his magical powers to keep his brother and rival kabal chained up so that he may not enslave the human race well wouldnt you know it a prophesy comes true and kabal breaks free and begins collecting elements including platinum and uranium for his alchemy experiments with the help of a police woman named sam can mordrid defeat his evil brother dr mordrid comes to me courtesy of charles band in the full moon archive collection i had not heard of it which is a bit odd given that im a big fan of jeffrey combs mordrid and the film isnt that old but now its mine and i can enjoy it again and again the film certainly is fun in the classic full moon style richard band provides the music which doesnt differ much from all his other scores and brian thompson plays the evil kabal we even have animated dinosaur bones! what more do you want of course the cheese factor is high i felt much of the film was a rip-off of the dr strange comics and the blue pantsuit was silly and plot holes are everywhere i could list at least five but why bother and why does the ancient symbol of mordrid and kabal look suspiciously like a hammer and sickle combs has never been a strong actor so he fits right in with the cheese these arent complaints full moon fans have come to expect these things and devour them like crack-laced grape nuts im guilty i loved this filmif youre not a full moon fan or a jeffrey combs fan you may want to look elsewhere but if you like the early 1990s style of movie-making and haircuts youll eat this up stallone and schwarzenegger fans might like seeing brian thompson as a villain looking as goony as ever and not being able to enunciate english beyond a third grade level i did i wish there was a mordrid ii but the company that makes a sequel to practically everything is gingerdead man 3 really necessary passed on this one<SEP>1
the plot was dull the girls were sickening and the supposed italian male lead had clearly never heard an italian accentsomeone said the boys were cute in this film but it just seemed to be filled with mediocre people there were literally no redeeming features about this filmi think this is a graveyard for actors that will never work again with the unfortunate exception of the olsen twins who seem to fascinate people for no discernible reasoni hope the olsen twins find something out of the limelight to keep them away from the entertainment business they have no place in it<SEP>0
what seemed at first just another introverted french flick offering no more than baleful sentiment became for me on second viewing a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentationspoiler of sorts followspoor cedric; he apparently didnt know what hit him poor audience; we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch these two guys just didnt belong together from their first ambiguous encounter as much as mathieu and cedric were sexually attracted to each other the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for mathieu an intellectual being to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beachon a purely technical note i loved the camera action in this film subtitles were totally unnecessary even though my french is presque rien i could watch it again without the annoying english translation and enjoy it even more this was a polished very professionally made motion picture though many scenes seem superfluous i rate it nine out of ten<SEP>1
a year or so ago i was watching the tv news when a story was broadcast about a zombie movie being filmed in my area since then i have paid particular attention to this movie called fido as it finished production and began playing at festivals two weeks ago fido began playing in my local theater and just yesterday i read a newspaper article which stated fido is not attracting audiences in its limited release with the exception of our local theater in fact here it is outdrawing all other shows at the paramount theater including 300 of course this makes sense as many locals want to see their city on screen or spot themselves roaming around in zombie make-up and for any other locals who havent seen fido yet but are considering it i can say there are many images on screen from the school to city park to the forbidden zone that you will recognize in fact they make the okanagan valley look beautiful thats right beautiful scenery in a zombie movie! however fido itself is a very good movie yes despite its flaws it is better then most of the 20 other movies playing in my local market fido is best described as an episode of lassie in which the collie has been replaced by a member of the undead this is a clever premise and the movie even goes further by taking advantage of the 1950s emphasize on conformity and playing up the cold-war paranoia which led to mccarthyism furthermore it builds on the notion that zombies can be tamed or trained which george romero first introduced in day of the deadksun ray plays a small town boy whos mother carrie-ann moss longs for a zombie servant so she can be like all the other house wives on her block however his dad dylan baker is against the idea as he once had to kill his own zombie father eventually the family does acquire a zombie named fido played by billy connolly and adjusts to life with the undead billy connolly was inspired casting he is able to convey fidos confusion longing hatred and loyalty through only his eyes lumbering body and grunts connolly shows that he can play understated characters better than his outrageously comedic ones this is his best role since mrs brownfido follows in the footsteps of other recent zomcoms such as shawn of the dead and zombie honeymoon being someone who appreciates bruce campbell and misty mundae movies more than eli roth and jigsaw ones i prefer humor over gore in my horror however i understand the criticism of those horror fans who feel there is not enough undead carnage in fido yet i am sure patient viewers will be rewarded by the films gentle humorthe movie does break down in its third act its as if the writers were so wrapped up in the cute premise of domesticated zombies in the 1950s they forgot about the story arc however given my interest in horror comedies and my appreciation for seeing the neighborhood on screen i rate fido 9 out of 10<SEP>1
i spent almost two hours watching a movie that i thought with all the good actors in it would be worth watching i couldnt believe it when the movie ended and i had absolutely no idea what had happenedi was mad because i could have used that time doing something elsei tried to figure it all out but really had no clue thanks to those who figured it out and have explained itright or wrong its better than not knowing anything!! who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away how did first lady know that her husband was cheating on her at the end of the movie kate said she would eventually find out the truth does this mean that were going to be subjected to end game 2<SEP>0

deathtrap runs like a play within a movie about who did what to whom as it primarily takes place on one set the premise is that an accomplished playwright whose star is falling receives a magnificent manuscript from a former student and so he plans to off his protege and appropriate his play to the loud protests of his wife or so you think for the first half of the movie past the halfway mark deathtrap begins to throw in twists and surprises that turn its premise on its head then right around and then in a mad spin all the time keeping its title appropriate its an excellent mystery movie soaked in wit michael caine as the senior playwright plays himself in this movie - a slightly loony and very dramatic brit no surprises here - he does his usual good work he gets the best line of deathtrap which he executes perfectly: what is your definition of success being gang-banged in a state penitentiary christopher reeve on the other hand juggles comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance playing the ambitious and psychopathic young playwright he also gets to show off his very toned body which he mustve retained coming off the superman movies caine and reeve have collaborated in another movie thats one of my favorite comedies - noises off it similarly revolves around a play as well although this time caine is the director and reeve is an actor they are joined by comic veterans carol burnett john ritter marilu henner taxi and mark linn-baker perfect strangers together they demonstrate the calamities that befall the bed-hopping cast and crew of a play on the surface the movie looks to be mostly slapstick but upon watching you find that they are many subtle jokes that require more than one viewing to catch wish this underrated movie was available on dvd<SEP>1
good old black and white graham greene based people in dangerous times doing heroic and mysterious things hardly a shot fired or a punch thrown and a hundred time more interesting than the glop thats being minted by hollywood today bacall lights up the screen of course and boyer is entirely engaging they dont make movies like this any more<SEP>1

there is an episode of the simpsons which has a joke news report referring to an army training base as a killbot factory here the comment is simply part of a throwaway joke but what patricia foulkrods documentary does is show us scarily that it is not that far from the truth after world war two the us army decided to tackle a problem they faced throughout the war; that many soldiers got into battle and found themselves totally unable to kill another human being unless it was a matter of me or them since then the training process of the us army has been to remove all moral scruples and turn recruits into killing machines who dont think of combatants as people to develop in them a most unnatural state: the sustainable urge to killfirst off this isnt an antiwar movie as such whilst it certainly paints war in a very bad light foulkrod focuses rather on an aspect that doesnt get as much media attention as say the debate over the legality of a war or its physical successes or failures; the affect the process of turning a man into a soldier has on that person as a human being its the paradox that to train someone to be a soldier to defend society makes them totally unsuitable to live as part of that society themselves and whilst most of the examples and interviewees are from the current middle east conflict foulkrod makes the links to past conflicts especially vietnam painfully clear this isnt about any particular war its about the problems caused by war in generalstructurally the film seems to be split into three sections; how recruits are drawn into the army and the training they receive how they are treated once they are in combat and what happens once they leave the army once this point is reached you realise that the main target of this film is actually the policies that are inherent in the armed forced policies that are put into place to make soldiers into an affective combat force but removing all humanity from the individuals those interviewed tell the camera how the recruiting process seems so clean and simple how word like democracy and freedom are banded around but once the training begins they become enemy and kill and destroy how once in action soldiers dont care what they are ordered to do as they are ingrained with the idea that as soon as they carry out an order whatever it may be they are one step closer to going home they have no political or social ideals to fight for but fight and kill as thats what theyve been trained to dobut the ground truths main goal is to highlight the way the us army discards those who have fought for their country once they return home there is no real rehabilitation given to soldiers returning and many are forced to go home unable to cope with what they have seen and done and most policies in place seem to be to make sure the army has no legal responsibility whatsoever for psychological affects their soldiers pick up this is the final indignity that once they are used they are cast awayif there is a flaw in the film it is that foulkrod doesnt attempt to show another side to the argument you would get the impression that every single soldier who ever went to war would come back with post traumatic stress syndrome it would have been interesting to see those of a less liberal upbringing give their opinions of how the army handles training and policies there is never a chance for the other side of the argument to make itself knownbut other than that this is an expertly crafted documentary and foulkrods use of stock footage and music is perfectly utilised to get across a side of war that too often get s passed by when discussing the fallout of war<SEP>1
i am commenting on this miniseries from the perspective of someone who read the novel first and from that perspective i can honestly say that while enjoyable i can see why it hasnt been rebroadcast anytime recently more specifically this mini has some serious problems such as:1 it is terribly miscast the actors who played the younger generation were all 15 to 20 years older than the characters ali mcgraw 45 at the time was playing natalie jastrow who was supposed to be about 26 jan-michael vincent 39 at the time was playing byron henry who was supposed to be about 22 the other henry children and pamela tudsbury were also played by actors way too old for characters who were supposed to be in their 20s2 some of the acting was absolutely awful ali mcgraw at times almost made this mini unwatchable i have seen more convincing performances in high school plays 3 the directing was poor to be fair to ali mcgraw the bad acting and character development were probably the directing the portrayal of hitler was way overdone his character came off looking and behaving more like a cartoon villain than the charismatic sometimes charming but always diabolical genius herman wouk painted him as in the novel some of the other characters are done so stereotypically berel jastrow they do not gain the depth of character that wouk created for them4 this mini is very dated the hokey music the pretentious narration it sounded like a junior high school history film narration and the entire prime-time soap opera feel of the mini made it almost comical at times also too often byron and natalie are costumed and made up to look like they are in 1979 rather than 1939someone who watches this without the benefit of reading the novel first will probably not sit through it all because it will come off more as a late 70s early 80s take myself too seriously prime-time soap drama rather than the television version of what is certainly a modern american classicremakes of older movies and the like are sometimes poorly done but this is probably one case where a creative and inspired director could make a very stunning memorable and critically acclaimed production i dont ever see that happening since a remake would have to be just as long 15 hours or longer to do it right and given the short attention span of most of the current american viewing public it wouldnt fly<SEP>0
british comedies tend to fall into one of two main types: the quiet introspective usually romantic study and the farcical social satire settings characters and concepts vary but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories butterflies is perhaps the epitomé of the first type the scripts are very verbal including long interior monologues by the main character ria a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life when she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman who makes his interest in her quite clear she toys with the idea of finding out what the other path might have offeredthe acting and scripts are always on the money which makes ones reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one: i was neither blown away by it nor turned off my mother on the other hand adored this show i think the degree to which one identifies with rias dilemma is the most important factor in determining ones reaction to butterflies<SEP>1
its like what other dracula movies always do the minions of dracula always on draculas side which is what disappointed me at the ending regardless the person wants to stay a vampire or not i would like to see something like in the first movie that the minion fights against her master it is much interesting since you can almost predict how the story goes than just either the priest or d win the game we need some surprising plots!<SEP>0
i cant believe that this movie even made it to video and that video rental stores are willing to put it on their shelves i literary asked for a refund take away the fact that the movie has no historical truth it and it is still the worse movie ever found in a video store it is not even good enough to be called a b rated movie do not waste your money or your time on this movie just listing to the voice over and the horrible music made me sick anyone involved with this movie should be pulled from the union gives the industry a black mark but after watching most of this movie i really dont think anyone involved is a union member<SEP>0

i watched scarecrows because of the buzz surrounding it well i cant imagine anyone liking this movie because its just bad bad badits obvious that whoever made this movie doesnt know a single thing about horror the whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two genres: action movie guns and criminals and horror living scarecrows when the criminals are killed one by one by the poky looking scarecrows the two genres automatically cancel each other out because first theyre criminals and who cares about criminals and second because theyre stupid criminals to boot! having zombie scarecrows go after them just doesnt work here wheres the horror in that i wanted the criminals to die horrible painful deathsbut the story is so badly constructed that this marriage of genres which could have been original if handle well never gels were simply left with is a bunch of super dense criminals and a bunch of scarecrows which are alive for whatever flimsy reason the filmmakers thought up making things even worse is the fact that the cinematography is terrible tv like and worse offense of all whole bunches of the dialogue are told on cbs and we continuously hear inane dialogue spoken over disconnected images as if were watching some sort of radio show this part was really bad the director should have been shot on the spot for coming up with such a stupid idea! i cant tell you how annoying that wasas ive already mentioned the criminals in scarecrows are amazingly stupid for instance when someone suddenly shows up gutted and filled with money and straw yep straw in his huge open wound the others ask what drug is he on after they shoot tons of bullets in him unable to kill him hes been zombiefied by the scarecrows dont ask get a freaking clue morons ive never seen such stupid people in a movie and then theres the girl i wished one of the scarecrows had killed her quickly because she was a pain in the butt when she finds her father nailed to a scarecrow cross she actually blames the criminals in an embarrassing scene bad acting even though the criminals couldnt have done it what a dimwit she was! but the scarecrows are the biggest weakness in this very weak flick theyre not scary nothing much is explained about them theyre just a plot device in this plot device filled moviemr wesley filming the face of a scarecrow for 30 seconds nonstop doesnt elicit anything but sheer boredom and that scene with the talking head in the fridge thanks for the laughterall in all this had to be one of the worst movies ive seen recently and ive seen a lot of movies these days! between the equally woeful silo killer or scarecrows id rather watcher silo killer again yep scarecrows is that bad<SEP>0
my girlfriend picked this one; as a southern born and raised african american i found this movies plot and premise totally without credibility to believe that class and racial biases would be so easily and comfortably suspended would only come from someone totally unfamiliar with the ante-bellum south totally absurd !!! i wonder how they got a good actor like harvey keitel and a good actress like andie mcdowell who being southern knows better to participate in this crap<SEP>0
oh come on people give this film a break the one thing i liked about it was sorry still thinking oh yeah!!!! when john wayne came and shot up the the bad guys oh sorry wrong movie i was thinking of a better quality film let me see now im still trying to defend it oh yeah the chick that was from clueless was in it dont put down stacy dash i mean we all make mistakes but boy stacy you made a dooooosiehey one thing that has never been done in a western even an all female cast they actually hung a woman from the gallows that might be a western first even though her neck should have been broken and she survived the ordeal still youve got to give the director some effort for trying a western first also ive never seen a woman lynched from a horse in any western although that didnt happen in this movie i just thought i would give the director another idea for gang of roses#2 which should be made right after ed woods bride of the monster #2 maybe that was what the makers of this film were going for orginality especially with an all african woman cast and an oriental cowgirlheeey if the makers of gang of roses want to make a sequel to this mess you could have such slang like hey dont you be takin about my homegirls and talk to the hand baby talk to the hand you could also have a surfer dude type deputy marshal that says things like that gunfight was totally rad man totally you know things like that<SEP>0
just saw this tonight at a seminar on digital projection shot on 35mm and first feature film fully scanned in 6k mastered in 4k and projected with 2k projector at etcusc theater in hwdso much for tech stuff 18 directors including alexander payne wes cravens joel and ethan coen gus van sant walter salles and gerard depardieu among several good french international directors were each given 5 minutes to make a love story they come in all shapes and forms with known actorselijah wood natalie portman steve buscemi totally hilarious maggie glyllenhall nick nolte geena rowlands soo goodand she actually wrote the piece she was in msr depardieu and many good international actors as well the stories vary from all out romance to quirky comedy to alex paynes touching study of a woman discovering herself to van sant and one of those things that happens anywheremaybe nothing really off putting by having french spoken in most sequences with english subtitles and a small amount of actual english spoken though that will probably relegate it to art houses a la diva also only one piece that might be considered experimental but colorful and funny as well the rest simple studies of sometimes complex relationships all easy to follow unless the experimental one irritates your desire for a formulaic story several brought up some emotions for mei admit i am affected by love in cinemawhen it is presented in something other than sentimentality i even laughed at a mime piece like no other i have seen thank you for that! the film hit its peak for me somewhere around a little more than half way through then the last two sequences picked up again some beautiful shots of paris at night lush romantic kind of music usually used to good effect not just schmaltz for emotions in sound generally good cinematography though some shots seemed soft focus when it couldnt have meant to have been main character in shotscene pacing of each film was good and overall structure though a bit long they left out two of what was to be 20 films but said all would be on the dvd seemed to vary between tones of the films to keep a good balance not sure when it comes out but a good study of how to make a 5 min film workand sometimes what doesnt work if it covers too much time emotionally for a short film should be in region one when released but they didnt know when<SEP>1
yokai daisenso is a childrens film by takashi miike but as you might expect its probably a bit too dark & scary for younger ones however older children may well eat this up that is if you play it dubbed in englishthe story is that of a young boy who has moved with his mother to the country to live with his grandfather after a divorce during a village festival the boy is chosen as a kirin rider a great honor but with that honor comes much danger and adventure of coursemeanwhile evil doings are at hand as a woman in a white mini skirt go-go boots & a beehive hair-do teams up with an evil yokai to turn peoples resentments and discarded items against them and this evil has manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster that heads for the city of rage itself tokyo one quite funny scene has two derelicts watching the monster fly over the citysays one oh its only gamera the young boy has befriended yokai which are monsters of a kind mostly benign that have isolated themselves away from humans and all the yokai in japan band together to fight the evilin many ways miike & crew have taken the late 60searly 70s yokai films and turned them into a modern action adventure film for older kids that also combines some strange mechanical monsters that made me think of transformers the look and feel of the film is great the effects are entertaining and some of the humor will just sail right over kids heads but still older ones might enjoy it as for adults theres not much here not to like if youre a fan of japanese monster movies youll enjoy the heck out of thiscool & fun stuff kind of dark at times but perhaps thats just miikeand what a wild ride 8 out of 10<SEP>1
this utterly dull senseless pointless spiritless and dumb movie isnt the final proof that the world can forget about danny boyle and his post-trainspotting movies: the beach already took care of that what this low-budget oddity does is merely to secure his place among those who started very well but got completely lost in drugs booze ego self-delusion bad management or whatever it was that lead to this once-promising directors quick demisethe premise is absurd: two losers ecclestone and some bimbo jenna g - a rapper likely meet by chance and spontaneously start singing with fervour more akin to lunatic asylum inhabitants than a potential hit-making duo - which they become a friend of theirs - an even bigger illiterate loser - becomes their manager by smashing a store window and stealing a video-camera by which he films them in action and then shows the tape to some music people who actually show interest in this garbage now i know that the uk in recent years has put out incredible junk but this is ridiculous; the music makes oasis seem like the beatles during the studio recordings the duo - strumpet - change lyrics in every take and ecclestone quite arrogantly tells the music biz guys to take it or leave it and quite absurdly they do take it not only is the music total and utter trash but its performers are anti-social; these newcomers are supposed to be calling the shots its just too dumb its plain awfulthe dialog is unfunny and goes nowhere and this rags-to-bitches story has no point and makes no sense it often feels improvised - under the influence of drugs danny boyle is a complete idiot this little piece of trash is so bad its embarrassing to watch ecclestones iq also has to be questioned for agreeing to be part of this nonsense whoever financed this £1000 joke should leave the movie business before they end up selling their own underwear on street corners<SEP>0
the prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of nietzches work and personality psychoanalytical techniques and viennas history take a well-know genius you have not read describe him as demented include crazy physicians to cure him a couple of somewhat good looking women have his role played by an actor with an enormous mustache have every character speak with the strongest accent show ridiculous dreams include another prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first one freud mention a few words used in the genius works overdo everything you can particularly music and you are done audience please stay away<SEP>0
this film is definitely a product of its times and seen in any other context it is an incredibly stupid movie heck even seen in its proper context its pretty bad!! mostly this is due to a silly plot and very self-indulgent direction by the famed italian director michelangelo antonioni in this case he tried to meld a very artsy style film with an anti-establishment hippie film and only succeeded in producing a bomb of gargantuan proportionsthe film begins with a rap session where a lot of with it students sit around saying such platitudes as power to the people and complaining about the man considering most of these hippies have parents sending them to college it seemed a bit silly for these privileged kids to be complaining so loudly and shouting revolutionary jargon a bit later violence between the students and the establishment pigs breaks out and a cop is killed our hero mark may or may not have done it but he is forced to run to avoid prosecution instead of heading to mexico or canada he does what only a total moron would do--steals an airplane and flies it to the mojave desert! there he meets a happen chick and they then sit around philosophizing for hours then they have sex in one of the weirder sex scenes in cinema history as they gyrate about in the dust suddenly other couples appear from no where and there is a huge orgy scene while you see a bit of skin warranting an r-rating its not as explicit as it could have been in fact it lasts so long and seems so choreographed that it just boggles the mind and of course when they are finished the many many other couples vanish into thin airoddly later the couple paint the plane with some help and it looks a lot like a peter max creation despite improving the look of the plane the evil cops respond to his returning the plane by shooting the nice revolutionary when the girl finds out she goes into a semi-catatonic state and the movie ends with her seemingly imagining the destruction of her own fascist pig parents and all the evil that they stand for such as hard work and responsibility instead of one simple explosion you see the same enormous house explode about 8 times then inexplicably you see tvs refrigerators and other things explode in slow motion while dumb it is rather cool to watch--sort of like when david letterman blows things up or smashes things on his showaside from a dopey plot the film suffers from a strong need for a single likable character as well as extensive editing at least 15 minutes could easily be removed to speed things up a bit--especially since there really isnt all that much plot or dialog the bottom line is that this is an incredibly dumb film and i was not surprised to see it listed in the fifty worst films book by harry medved its a well deserved addition to this pantheon of crap for such a famed director to spend so much money to produce such a craptastic film is a crime!two final observations if you like laughing at silly hippie movies also try watching the trial of billy jack also in a case of art imitating life the lead mark frechette acted out his character in real life he died at age 27 in prison a few years after participating in an act of revolution in which he and some friends robbed a bank and killed an innocent person dang hippies!!<SEP>0
i did not expect a lot from this movie after the terrible life is a miracle it turns out that this movie is ten times worse than life i have impression that directorwriter is just joking with the audience: let me see how much emptiness can you audience sustain dialogues are empty scenario is minimalistic in few moments photography is really nice few sarcastic lines are semi-funny but it is hard to genuinely laugh during this comedy ive laughed to myself for being able to watch the movie until the end if you can lift yourself above this directors fiasco you will find good acting of few legends miki manojlovic aleksandar bercek and very good performance of emirs son stribor kusturicain short: too bad for such a great director ! emir kusturica is still young and should be making top-rated movies instead he chooses to do this low-budget just-for-my-private theater movie with arrogant attitude toward the world trends and negligence toward his old fans<SEP>0
as far as i am concerned this silent version of the merry widow is the worst version ever made there is no tenderness or love or spirituality about this version it is all macabre germanic sinister nonsense it reminded me of nazis falling in love; who caresthis silent version by von stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story in this one we have leering john gilbert and his gross relative the prince lusting after this silly american actress played by mae murray possessed with a modern permed hairstyle and implausible feminist manner that threw me off again and again i like my romances light and beautiful with slow build ups; not harsh and sadistic like this one and come on those bee stung lips get rid of them girl!go see a live performance of the show if you would like to get a real idea of the sweetness of the original operetta by franz lehar failing that wait till tcm shows the jeanette macdonald - maurice chevalier sound version its much better<SEP>0
on the 28th of december 1895 in the grand café in paris film history was writing itself while louis lumière showed his short films all single shots to a paying audience la sortie des usines lumière was the first film to be played and i wish i was there not only to see the film but also the reactions of the audiencewe start with closed doors of the lumière factory apparently since the image seems a photograph people thought they were just going to see a slide show not something they were hoping for but then the doors open and people are streaming out heading home first a lot of women then some men and one man on a bike with a big dog when they are all out the doors close againwhether this is the first film or not some say larrivée dun train à la ciotat was the first film lumière recorded it is an impressive piece of early cinema being bored by this is close to impossible for multiple reasons one simple reason: it is only fifty seconds long but also for people who normally only like the special effect films there must be something interesting here; you dont get to see historical things like this every day<SEP>1
very silly movie filled with stupid one liners and jewish references thru out it was a serious movie but could not be taken seriously a familiar movie plotbeing at the wrong place at the wrong time an atrocious subplot involving kim bassinger very robotic and too regimented i have noticed that al pacinos acting abilities seem to be going downhill a troubleshooter with troubles but nothing more troubling than pacinos horrible atlanta accent damage control needs to fix this damage of a film ok my one liners are bad but not as bad as the ones in this film this movie manages to not only be boring but revolting as well usually a revolting film is watchable for the wrong reasons this movie is unwatchable i did manage to sit through this the plot if written a tad bit better with perhaps a little better acting and eliminating the horrendous subplotand even dumber jokes could have pulled this thriller out of the doldrums what we are left with is a dull silly movie that made sure it was drilled into our heads that eli wurman was jewish an embarrassment to all the good jewish folk everywhere<SEP>0
when robot hordes start attacking major cities who will stop the madman behind the attacks sky captain!!! jude law plays joe sullivan the ace of the skyways tackling insurmountable odds along with his pesky reporter ex-girlfriend polly perkins gwyneth paltrow and former flight partner captain franky cook angelina joliesky captain and the world of tomorrow may look and feel like an exciting movie but it really is quite dull and underwhelming the films running time is 106 minutes yet it feels so much longer because there is no substance in this movie the visuals were great and the film did a nice job on that however there is nothing to support these wonderful visuals the film lacks a story and interesting characters making the while thing quite dull and unnecessary i blame director and writer kerry conran he focuses too much on the visuals and spent little time on the actual story the movie is like a girl with no personality after awhile it kind of gets bland and tiring sky captain represents a beautiful girl with no personality its simply just another case of style over substancethe acting is surprisingly average and thats not really their fault since they had very little to work with the main reason i watched this movie is because of angelina jolie however the advertising is quite misleading and she is only in the film for about 30 minutes her performance is surprisingly bland as well jude law gives an okay performance though you would expect a lot more from him gwyneth paltrow was just average nothing special at all ling bais performance was the only one i really liked she gives a pretty good performance as the mysterious woman and she was the only interesting character in the entire filmthe movie is not a complete bust though there were some wow and exciting scenes there just werent enough of them the film just doesnt have that hook to really make it memorable it was actually quite bland and it wasnt very engaging at all its too bad the film wasnt very good since it had such a promising premise in the end sky captain is surprisingly below average and not really worth watching rating 410<SEP>0
hundstage is an intentionally ugly and unnerving study of life in a particularly dreary suburb of vienna it comes from former documentary director ulrich seidl who adopts a very documentary-like approach to the material however the film veers away from normal types and presents us with characters that are best described as extremes  some are extremely lonely; some extremely violent; some extremely weird; some extremely devious; some extremely frustrated and misunderstood; and so on the film combines several near plot less episodes which intertwine from time to time each following the characters over a couple of days during a sweltering viennese summer very few viewers will come away from the film feeling entertained  the intention is to point up the many things that are wrong with people the many ills that plague our society in general it is a thought-provoking film and its conclusions are pretty damning on the wholea fussy old widower fantasises about his elderly cleaning lady and wants her to perform a striptease for him while wearing his deceased wifes clothes a nightclub dancer contends with the perpetually jealous and violent behaviour of her boy-racer boyfriend a couple grieving over their dead daughter can no longer communicate with each other and seek solace by having sex with other people an abusive man mistreats his woman but she forgives him time and again a security salesman desperately tries to find the culprit behind some vandalism on a work site but ends up picking on an innocent scapegoat and a mentally ill woman keeps hitching rides with strangers and insulting them until they throw her out of the car! the lives of these disparate characters converge over several days during an intense summer heat wavethe despair in the film is palpable many scenes are characterised by long awkward silences that are twice as effective as a whole passage of dialogue might be then there are other scenes during which the dialogue and on-screen events leave you reeling in particular a scene during which the security salesman leaves the female hitch-hiker to the mercy of a vengeful guy - to be beaten raped and humiliated thankfully all off-screen for some vandalism she didnt even do - arouses a sour almost angry taste in another scene a man has a lit candle wedged in his rear-end and is forced to sing the national anthem at gunpoint all as part of his punishment for being nasty to his wife while we might want to cheer that this thug is receiving his come-uppance we are simultaneously left appalled and unnerved by the nature of his punishment indeed such stark contrasts could act as a summary of the whole film - every moment of light-heartedness is counter-balanced with a moment of coldness every shred of hope is countered with a sense of despair for every character you could like or feel sympathy for there is another that encourages nothing but anger and hate we might want to turn away from hundstage to dismiss it as an exercise in misery but it also points up some uncomfortable truths and for that it should be applauded<SEP>1

this movie has everything emotion power affection stephane rideaus adorable naked beach dance it exposes the need for real inner communion and outer communication in any relationship just because cedric and mathieu are a couple who happen to be gay doesnt mean there isnt quite useful insight for anybody in it i would probably classify it as a gay movie but one that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexual people as well as homosexual and bisexual people mathieus incapacity to handle his emotions divulges the way our society doesnt encourage us to act any differently and that is what engenders the discord between him and cedric this is definitely a must-see!!!!<SEP>1

daniel day lewis in my left foot gives us one of the best performances ever by an actor he is brilliant as christy brown a man who has cerebral palsy who then learned to write and paint with his left foot a well deserved oscar for him and brenda fricker who plays his loving mother hugh oconner is terrific as the younger christy brown and ray mcanally is great as the father worth watching for the outstanding performances<SEP>1

going into seeing this movie i was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea especially a romantic fantasylittle did i know that i was in for a ride through cinematic magic everything in the movie from plot to dialogue to effects was very near perfectionclaire danes shines like the star she is in this movie from beginning to end you fall more and more in love with this charactermichelle pfeiffer is menacing as an evil witch bent on capturing the star for eternal youth and beautyrobert de niro is a lovable character who gives the audience the greatest bit of comic relief as the movie is gaining momentum towards the climaxoverall this was a movie that surprised and delighted me as a movie fan if you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that will be fun for the kids and adults alike stardust is the way to go<SEP>1
i have to say seventeen & missing is much better than i expected the perception i took from the previews was that it would be just humdrum but i was pleasantly surprised with this impressive mysterydedee pfeiffer is emilie a mom who insists her daughter lori tegan moss not attend a so-called graduation party one weeknight but lori ignores her mothers wishes and takes off for the party anyway when lori does not come home emilie knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearanceseventeen & missing is better than so many other tv movies of this type as it is not so predictable pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie and most of it comes off as believable this lmn original movie premiered last night 1010<SEP>1
one of the better kung fu movies but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews the movie starts out well enough with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier which is rarer than youd think for this era and make the non-fight dialogue sequences passable for a kung fu movie this is a great compliment unlike other chinese action movies which were always period pieces or in the wake of jackie chans police story i cop dramas pedicab driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china unfortunately in the latter 13 of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessarythe action is overall good featuring a duel between sammo and 12 of the shaw brothers only 2 stars kar-leung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet lis bad guy theres only 20 minutes of combat here which is standard but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other but there are smooth edits and then theres this it really takes away from the fights when its this obvious the footage was messed withthat said if you like kung fu movies my opinion here wont dissuade you and if you dont you just wasted 2 minutes of your life reading this<SEP>1
oh cgi a blessing when used properly a sin with its used by people who have no idea what their doing sadly thats not the only thing thats used poorly in this umpteen jaws rip-offok anybody who has read any number of my posted reviews has probably noticed 2 things 1: i like low-budget horror movies and 2: if there is a cute guy in said low-budget movie ill usually point them out so lets just get this out of the way right now this is one low-budget horror movie i didnt like the acting for the most part is horrible effects laughable and the script rivals battlefield earth as the worst ive witnessed this year as far as the resident cute boydax miller bog wins that prize hands down this boy is hot! and surprisingly hes not just a toned body with nice eyes and a cute butthe can actually act well as much as he can in this odious film now that we have the housekeeping chores out of the way lets get on with itin cliff notes version heres the story dont worry ill try not to give anything awaya film crew travels to a remote island to film a documentary about two surfers established cute boy and his buddy who surf with sharks unknown to them is a rather large salt water crocodile lurking around the island croc shows up mayhem ensues and people are eaten roll end creditsas i said earlier this film pretty much blows it started pretty well but soon devolved into being silly and stupid a main character becomes lunch in a rather humorous way and our remaining heros utter one-liners at the victims expense also if this croc is at the top of the food chain on both the land and in the water whats with all the sharks around if this thing can eat a 40 foot boat i dont think a few skimpy sharks would stick around the fx is some of the worst i have ever had the displeasure to see the cgi is horrendous and theyve even managed to screw up the animatronic crocs attention filmmakers national geographic discovery store the croc hunter they know what crocodiles look like you obviously didnt reference any of these judging by the monstrosity seen towards the end of the film and whats with the piratedrug pusher gang did you just need another reason to rip off a womans top its funny how we get little sub-genres in the movie world with alligator and its sequels lake placid crocodile and now blood surf it now looks like over-sized crocodilealligator movies should now get their own category at blockbuster alligator was good lake placid was good i even thought tobe hoopers crocodile was good blood surf suckedmy grade: d-<SEP>0
wwe was in need of a saviour as wrestlemania 14 rolled around the departure of bret hart and subsequent evaporation of the hart foundation had left the vile d-generation x stable unchallenged in the wwe their despicable leader shawn michaels had stolen the title from hart thanks to the interference of vince mcmahon and with help from his cohorts triple h and chyna had systematically taken out anyone who challenged his supremacy but at the royal rumble a new contender had emerged stone cold steve austin hated by mcmahonagement austin had dx worried so worried in fact that theyd enlisted the help of the baddest man on the planet mike tyson as a special enforcer austin would have the odds firmly against him in his title match with shawn michaelsbut first there was an undercard to get through which kicked off with the legion of doom winning a forgettable 15 team battle royal to become no1 contenders for the tag titles id actually forgotten this match existed until i rewatched the ppv no very good and really highlighted the lack of depth in the tag division at that period in timenext match saw the light heavyweight title defended by champion taka michonoku against aguila the wwe had established the light heavyweight title to compete with the strong cruiserweight division in wcw it was not successful and this was the only time the title was ever defended at wrestlemania short match going about five minutes and in fact too short for much to be achieved what little they did was exciting and this was a nice little match which saw taka retaining his titleok our next match saw dx member triple h defending the wwe european title which hed won in farcical fashion from shawn michaels on raw in december and hadnt defended on ppv against owen hart the sole survivor triple h got a big entrance with the dx band there to perform his theme song chyna accompanied triple h to ringside but was then handcuffed to wwe commissioner sgt slaughter triple h and owen have a nice little match before chyna interfered causing a low blow on hart which leads to triple h retaining the title good match could have been great had it gone slightly longerbut of course we wouldnt want to take time away from our next match which saw real life husband and wife marc mero and sable defeat goldust and luna vachon in the first mixed tag match at wrestlemania in 8 years and in all honesty it wasnt worth the wait while not terrible the match was in no way memorable either this was the nearing the end of meros only run in the wwe and the main purpose was to continue the disintegration of his relationship with sablenext up we saw ken shamrock flip out and cost himself the intercontinental championship as he destroyed ic champion the rock but then refused to let go of his ankle lock submission hold resulting in the referee reversing his decision this was a short match but decent for what it wasnext saw the first good match of the night as wwe tag team champions the new age outlaws lost their titles to cactus jack and chainsaw charlie in a fun dumpster match the decision was overturned the following night as cactus and chainsaw had thrown the outlaws into a dumpster backstage rather than the one being used in the match but this was still a fun matchnow it was time for the highly anticipated first ever meeting between kane and his brother the undertaker kane had cost undertaker the wwe championship at the royal rumble and then killed him when he helped shawn michaels lock undertaker in a casket and set him on fire as revenge for the undertaker burning down their parents house and leaving him horribly disfigured years before this was a decent match and told a nice story as the underataker absorbed everything kane could throw at him and then knocked him out with three tombstones to end the matchthis left only the main event which saw wwe champion face steve austin with mike tyson as the guest enforcer michaels had suffered a debilitating back injury in his match with the undertaker at the royal rumble and was remarkable in this match despite his physical limitations triple h and chyna were banished to the back in the early going after interfering from the outside the match ended with austin ducking an attempt at sweet chin music and hitting the stone cold stunner with the ref down tyson then came into the ring to count the three celebrating the win with austin and then knocking out michaels after the match it turned out tyson and austin were together and the cat had been playing with the mouse all alongthat was the final ppv match for shawn michaels for four and a half years it helped establish austin as the biggest star in the wrestling business and the mainstream publicity garnered by tysons appearance proved a crucial turning point in the wwes battle with wcw austin would go on to become the biggest star in wwe history and along with the rock mick foley the undertaker and triple h lead the wwe through the period where they would gain their highest level of cultural relevance and it all started here at wrestlemania 14<SEP>1
one of my favorite shows in the 80s after the first season it started going downhill when they decided to add jean bruce scott to the cast deborah pratt was wonderful and it was fun watching her and ernest borgnines character go at it with each other the last episode she appeared in was one of my favorites for in the second season unfortunately during those days blacks did not last long on television shows some of the episodes in the second season where okay but the third season it was more about the human characters than airwolf and it was not shown until almost at the end of the show when it went to usa it was disgusting!!!<SEP>1
after reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews i decided that i would add my ten cents worth to say i thought the film was excellent not only in the visual beauty the writing music score acting and directing but in putting across the story of joseph smith and the road he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in god the way he felt and knew to be his path i am very pleased indeed to have had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man i recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself no matter what religious path he or she may be walking this only instills one with more determination to live the life that we should with true values of love and forgiveness as the savior taught us to do<SEP>1

i dont watch much porn but i love porn stars and i love gory movies so when i heard about a porn-star gore movie i was really excited of course that was years ago and when i heard about all the trouble with making and finishing the movie i never thought id actually get to see it but i did and im not ashamed to admit i loved it even with all its flawsfirst the flaws the story is set in ireland and is called samhain but the story it seemed to want to tell is about the sawney beane clan from scotland so why not just set it there and skip the third-grade report about samhainirish immigrantshalloween also it breaks its own rules by stating that youre safe on the trails but then the cannibal mutants just start running amok everywhere its never clear how many cannibals were dealing with theres a big stone castle thats obviously ancient yet no ones noticed it before the self-conscious horror film references are annoying and so are the characters the heroine has a flashback montage of all her dead friends that include a character she never met the ending makes no senseso what works the gore! sure i would have liked more but it was refreshing to see such a nasty movie that wasnt afraid to be nothing more than a gore movie two murders are waay over the top and taylor hayes has a nice disgusting scene the two wild murders are even given extended shots on the dvd ive always been of the mind that gore can overcome a stupid story and evil breed reinforced that<SEP>1
i love the frequently misnomered masters of horror series horror fans live in a constant lack of nourishment projects like this and the similar greenlight project with gave us feast - like it or lump it are breeding grounds for wonderful thought bubbles in the minds of directors with a horror bent to develop and bring to maturation food for we who love to dine on horrorthis one began with a kernel of really-kool-idea and ran right off the edge of where in the world am i going with this!!!i dont know how to spoil the spoiled but spoiler ahead all of a sudden no there was that light drifting across the night sky earlier we have long haired luminescent aliens huh huh brain drilling males and yeah i get it but well the worst curse of storytelling - a rousing and promising set up without a rewarding denouementcue to storytellers your build up has to have a payoff that exceeds build up not the other way around storytelling math 101end of spoilers - big oops!<SEP>0
im not going to approach and critique the theories of raw i mean this is a site about movies and whether the movie delivers or is well-made and not a site debating philosophyhaving said that this video really blows its one talking-head shot of raw after another some of it is archival video so you can see how he has aged over the years and thats pretty cool but otherwise the viewing experience is relentlessly monotonousits a strange comparison but i kept thinking of the sunday afternoon when i watched some of the barbra streisand star vehicle *funny lady* another really bad movie after a while i was so odd on barbra i kept wishing there would be one scene that she wouldnt appear in: you know a meanwhile other characters in the movie were up to something else moment but it was all about barbra well this video is raws *funny lady* so if your idea of a good time is to look at multiple takes and angles of the face of raw while he prattles on with his theories assembled in a lame structure that doesnt add any interest or insight then be my guest for me i couldnt take it after 20 minutes<SEP>0
poorly-made blaxploitation crime-drama aimed squarely at the black urban market of the early 1970s pam grier stars in the title role that of a nurse who becomes a one-woman vigilante after drug-dealing thugs make coffys little sister a junkie violent nonsense plods along doggedly with canned energy and excitement; only griers flaring temper gives the narrative a jolt shes not much of an actress here but she connects with the audience in a primal way not much different from what charles bronson was doing at this time the film was marketed and advertised as crass exploitation yet still managed to find a sizable inner-city audience today however its merely a footnote in 70s film history and lacks the wide-range appeal of other movies in this genre *12 from ****<SEP>0
the complaints are valid to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women i am okay with these night time soaps like greys anatomy or ugly betty or west wing because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end however when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men taye diggs tim daly and chris lowell into sexual tension and romps and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called little hospital it seems like general hospitalor a female counterpart to baywatch that was what men wanted and they had it so if this is what women want so be it but the idea that this is a high brow show or something men will watch is unrealistic<SEP>0
reading through all these positive reviews i find myself baffled how is it that so many enjoyed what i consider to be a woefully bad adaptation of my second favourite jane austen novel there are many problems with the film already mentioned in a few reviews; simply put it is a hammed-up over-acted chintzy mess from opening credits to butchered endingwhile many characters are mis-cast and neither ewan mcgregor nor toni collette puts in a performance that is worthy of them the worst by far is paltrow i have very much enjoyed her performance in some roles but here she is abominable - she is self-conscious nasal slouching and entirely disconnected from her characters and those around her an extremely disappointing effort - though even a perfect emma could not have saved this film<SEP>0
as a spiritualist and non christian i thought i really was going to be holding onto my faith but what a load of i seers i thought the film would have great arguments but only got one sided views from atheists and jews and who are all these street people hes interviewing who dont know the back of their arm from their head where are the proper theologians and priests and stuff he could have got arguments from not retired nuts who wrote books and finished their studies in 1970 personally this dvd was a waste of time and not worth my time to check if the facts are right or wrong or if i should or should not believe because an anti-christ told me so please to think he came up with the conclusion of not finding god because his own ego and demons got the better of him no im not going to say the movie was stunning to help atheists reading this feel better about themselves but if you really want to show the world you care about us poor souls who believe in jesus then entice us with your worth not your beating off the drums<SEP>0
an executive very successful in his professional life but very unable in his familiar life meets a boy with down syndrome escaped from a residence both characters feel very alone and the apparently less intelligent one will show to the executive the beauty of the small things in life with this argument the somehow amelie-like atmosphere and the sentimental music i didnt expect but a moralistic disgusting movie anyway as there were some interesting scenes the boy is sometimes quite a violent guy and the interpretation of both actors daniel auteil and pasqal duquenne was very good i decided to go on watching the movie the french cinema in general has the ability of showing something that seems quite much to life opposed to the more stereotyped american cinema but because of that it is much more disappointing to see after the absurd ending with the impossible death of the boy the charming tone the happiness of the executives family the cheap moral the unbearable laughter of the daughters the guy waving from heaven as michael landon really nasty in my humble opinion<SEP>0
this is one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen the footage is extraordinary mesmerizing at times it also received an oscar for best photography and deservedly so i have many movies in my film collection and several more ive seen besides them and not many of them are more beautifully or even equally as beautifully shot as this oneits unique and an overall great movie the cast is terrific and do a great job in portraying their characters we follow their destinies with devotion and get very emotionally attached to them along the way we also learn things about ourselves and our lives i think much of this film for what it represent and how it present it i warmly recommend it<SEP>1
william powell is a doctor dealing with a murder and an ex-wife in the ex-mrs bradford also starring jean arthur eric blore and james gleason it seems that powell had chemistry going with just about any woman with whom he was teamed though he and myrna loy were the perfect screen couple the actor made a couple of other thin man type movies one with ginger rogers and this one with arthur both to very good effectsomehow one never gets tired of seeing powell as a witty debonair professional and the ex-mrs bradford is no exception the ex-mrs b has mr b served with a subpoena for back alimony and then moves back in to help him solve a mystery that shes dragged him into and this isnt the first time shes done that! it almost seems as though there was a bradford film before this one or that this was intended to be the first of a series of films - mr b complains that his mystery-writer ex is constantly bringing him into cases this time a jockey riding the favorite horse in a raise mysteriously falls off the horse and dies right before the finish linethe solution of the case is kind of outlandish but its beside the point the point is the banter between the couple and the interference of the ex-mrs b jean arthur is quite glamorous in her role and very funny however with an actress who comes off as brainy as arthur does the humor seems intentional rather than featherbrained i suspect the writer had something else in mind - say the wacky side of carole lombard when arthur hears that the police have arrived she says ah its probably about my alimony ive been waiting for the police to take a hand in it its more of a rib to powell rather than a serious statement it still works well and it shows how a good actress can make a part her owndefinitely worth watching as william powell and jean arthur always were<SEP>1
it should come as no shock to you when i say that alone in the dark is a crappy movie to put it bluntly its as if a dung monster defecated ate the result and then vomited the final product would still outshine this movieseemingly based on an ancient ! atari video game the movie has something or other to do with a portal to the bowels of the earth the unleashing of demons and ancient civilizations something about there being two worlds that of darkness and that of light guess which ones ours oh and 10000 years ago a really super-duper advanced civilization opened the portal demons came over and had a blast then wiped out the civilization which is why weve never heard of them conveniently enoughchristian slater perhaps pining for the days of heathers and pump up the volume plays edward carnby a paranormal researcher to whom something bad happened when he was 10 years old hes hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of said advanced civilization carnby used to be part of a secret institution called 713 which has been trying to figure out what happened to that long-ago civilization but carnby believed he wasnt going to be able to find the answers he sought so he left the groupbut see these beasties are out and they get their prey in varying ways such as gutting them splitting them down the middle implanting neurological control devices in them or just turning them into killing zombies yes its another zombie moviethats about as distilled i can make the plot its pretty convoluted and incomprehensible in similar movies one might see the intrepid researcheradventurer figure things out a step at a time and when we the audience are mentally with the researcher its a lot of fun but when the scenes shift from attack to attack with no perspective or context not so much funthe acting is dreadful save for slater who although he almost seems embarrassed to be in the movie showed he was capable of carrying the acting load he had to; get this - tara reid is cast as a museum curator! honest to goodness i thought id seen the casting of a lifetime when denise richards was cast as a nuclear physicist in tomorrow never dies but reid here matches richards crappy emoting for crappy emoting hightlights include reid pronouncing newfoundland as new fownd land reid delivering most of her lines in a dazed throaty monotone kinda like shed been on an all-night bender for the past week before filming reid - a museum curator mind you - spending a lot of the movie in a midriff-bearing top and hip-hugger jeans oh yeah she was as believable as jessica simpson giving stock quotes oh why must the pretty ones be so dumb note: i dont think tara reids all that good looking she looks like shes in perpetual need of food almost everyone else in the cast is completely forgettable except perhaps for steven dorff who played burke one of the leaders of 713 dorffs character wasnt terribly well developed but nothing in the movie was from the sets to the characters to tara reid but i digressanyway the perplexing and utterly preposterous storyline is tough enough to follow with the film moving at such a breakneck pace but director uwe boll tosses in a pounding mind-deadening soundtrack; its so loud you cant hear what the actors are saying in some of the scenes! that cant be right given the acting level however perhaps thanks are in order to mr bolloh and a fun note the opening moments of the movie include narration of the words that are crawling across the screen at the same time remember the first star wars you heard that now-familiar star wars theme while the prologue crawled there was surely no need for narration; why do i need some doofus to read whats on the screen for me were the producers simply looking out for blind people maybe that also explains why the soundtrack was so loud - they were also looking out for hard-of-hearing people also the narrator inexplicably had a lisp for the first few lines of the crawl - then lost it bizarrealone in the dark is a loud dopey mishmash of dreadful acting an incoherent script and ham-handed directing hardly a note rings true theres so much chaos that the audience simply gives up caring about the characters and roots for their demise even in the dark the demonic creatures seem cooler and much more developed by comparisonironically since there were only three other people in the theater i watched this alone in the dark i wonder if uwe boll planned it that way i cant quite give this the lowest rating because i had low hopes for it to begin with - and because it never grabbed me enough for me to get worked up about it its atrocious although slater redeems himself a tiny bit<SEP>0
i was given the opportunity to see this 1926 film in a magnificently restored theater that was once part of the extensive paramount chain of vaudeville houses this paramount has a mighty wurlitzer organ  also magnificently restored -- that was used to accompany the silent films of the daywe were fortunate enough to have dennis james a key figure in the international revival of silent films at the mighty wurlitzer playing appropriate music and thematic compositions fitting to the action on the film the print was a nearly perfect digital copy of the rapidly decaying nitrate negative and the entire experience was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see a silent film as it was meant to be seenthis was greta garbos first american film she was only 20 years old but already had 6 swedish films in her repertoireit is somewhat ironic that this is a silent film about an opera star; even though the mighty wurlitzer added immensely to the mise-en-scene it was necessary to leave much to the imaginationmodern audiences for the most part do not understand silent films acting was different then with expansive gestures and broad facial expressions therefore audiences laugh at inappropriate times  the acting is seen as hammy and over-done  but it was simply the style of the periodgarbo with all her subtlety did much to usher in the new age of acting: she could say more with a half-closed eye and volumes could be read into a downward glance or a simple shrug she exemplifies the truism that `a picture is worth a thousand wordseven though this is garbos first american film it is pretty obvious the studio knew what they had on their hands: this was mgm filmmaking at its best the sets and costumes were magnificent the special effects  which by todays standards are pretty feeble  were still electrifying and amazingthe script by vicente blasco ibanez from the novel by entre naranjos would seem to be tailor made for garbo; it showcases her strengths magnifies her assets and there is no pesky language problem to deal with: a swedish actress can play a spanish temptress with no suspension of disbelief on our parther co-star was mgms answer to rudolph valentino: ricardo cortez he does an admirable job and did something that few romantic stars of the day ever would have done in a film: allow himself to look unnactractive appear foolish and to grow old ungracefullythere are some fairly good character parts that are more than adequately acted  especially when you consider the powerhouse that was garbo notable among them are lucien littlefield as cupido and martha mattox as doña bernarda brullthis is when the extraordinary cinematographer william h daniels met garbo  they went on to make 20 films together he was the cinematographer on 157 films and his career spanned five decades! he was able to capture her ethereal beauty and it was his photography that was primarily responsible for the moniker by which she became known: the divine garbo without his magnificent abilities she would not have been the success that she wasseeing this film is an all-too-rare opportunity: if you ever have the chance do not miss it<SEP>1
there are movies that are awful and there are movies that are so awful they are deemed long-forgotten and unwatchable also lots of violence and bad stuff not just cheesy stuff; you know what i mean add to the mix as well what is the result of bad movies with such raunchy content why final justice of course! remember mitchell joe don baker was the star of that movie and that was riffed by joel and the bots on mystery science theater 3000 now this time with mike taking joels place on the satellite of love but with the same bots that trio got to make fun of mst3ks second joe don baker movie final justice of course much of the naughty stuff that i mentioned was removed for television release but still i want to watch that episode and mitchell as well because what does joe don hate the most why none other than mystery science theater 3000! ps if you have a big lots nearby check that store for the uncut tape! lol that happened to another user!<SEP>0
carnosaur 3: primal species 1996 d: jonathan winfrey scott valentine janet gunn rick dean anthony peck rodger halston terri j vaughn billy burnette why even bother reviewing this movie another stupid dinosaur movie in which top secret military guys discover those lethal and very fake-looking prehistoric monsters running around killing people in gory ways the original was bad enough the sequel was even worse this falls somewhere in between though unrelated to either of the previous carnosaur films rating: 2 out of 10 rated r for graphic violence and gore grisly images and profanity<SEP>0
awful! awful! awful! no i didnt like it it was obvious what the intent of the film was: to track the wheeling and dealing of the movers and shakers who produce a film in some cases these are people who represent themselves as other than what they are i didnt need a film to tell me how shallow some of the people in the film industry are i suppose im at fault really because i expected something like roman holidayim not a movie-maker nor do i take film classes but it appeared to me that the film consisted of a series of two-shots in the main where the actors! had been supplied with a loose plot-line and they were to improvise the dialogue henry jaglon makes the claim that he along with victoria foyt actually wrote the screenplay but the impression was that the actors cognisant of the general direction of the film extemporised the dialogue - and it was not always successful such a case in point was when ron silver made some remark which really didnt flow along the line of the conversation and im not going back to look for it! and greta scacchi broke into laughter even though they were supposed to be having a serious conversation because silvers remark was such a non sequitur you get the impression too that one actor deliberately tries to wrong foot the other actor and break hisher concentration another instance of this is when a producer tells silver to bring the &*%#@#^ documents 3 times silver looked literally lost for words i have seen one other film which looked like a series of drama workshops on improvisation and that was awful too!the fact that jaglon was able to attract greta scacchi no stranger to australia ron silver anouk ami and maximilian schell suggests it was a slow news week for them peter bogdanovich had a what-the-hell-am-i-doing-here look on his face at all times and i expected to hear him say: look im a director and screenwriter - not an actor - which would have been unnecessary to state! faye dunaway seemed more interested in promoting her son liam apart from the jerky delivery of the dialogue the hand-held camera became irritating even if it was for verisimilitude - as i suspect the natural dialogue was - and the interest in the principals became subsumed to the interest in the various youths walking along the strand trying to insinuate themselves into shot that at least approached cinema verite so that along with the irritating french singing during which i used the mute button made for a generally disappointing 90-odd minutesi think we should avoid apotheosising films such as this trying to see value in the film where it has little credit in order to substantiate a perceived transcendental level to it is misguided there was really nothing avant-garde about it it didnt come across as a work of art and yet it wasnt a documentary either i know it was a mocumentary but the real test is whether it is entertaining i was bored out of my skull! it did have one redeeming feature: it pronounced cannes correctly so i gave it 310<SEP>0
this is undeniably the scariest game ive ever played its not the average shoot-everything-that-moves kind of fps which i usually dont care much for but the acceptable gfx interesting weapons and magic great surround soundeffects scryeeee scryeeee and above all incredible atmosphere i love the scrye which enables you at certain places in the games to see or hear events that happened there in the past the only game ive had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere im a great horror fan escpecially of clive barkers stories and movies and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story 910 -1 because im no fps fan and perhaps the game was a bit short<SEP>1
spoiler alert ! ! ! personally i dont understand why pete did not help to save williams lifei mean that would be great to know why william was motivatedor forcedi think secret service members are every day peopleand there is a rumor the writer was a member of the secret servicenow hes motivations are clearwell knownbut as a rental this film will not satisfy youcause the old but used twiststhe average acting -these are just things in this filmonly for keep you wait the endclark johnson as the director of swat did a far better work like this timeand i still wondering how the producers for example michael douglasleft this film to theaters<SEP>0
badly directed garbage a mediocre nihilist sadistic gorefest if you are the sort of person who likes that see a shrink even if you are that person it doesnt make this a good film the acting is really poor the story full of plot holes the director really should just give up and find a real job as he has no talent for this one i can see why people dislike uwe boll we have had a few of his films on lately and this is the best of them which is really sad! a complete absence of any sort of humanity seems to suit some people but here it just grates horror films can be full of desolation they can be miniature works of art they can be just good viewing when there is nothing else on seed is just really really poor<SEP>0
in answer to the person who made the comment about how the film drags on and who believed there was no purpose to the role of jesss brother here is my response:the role of jesss brother is to provide a form of dramatic irony in the story craig sheffernorman could have foreseen the troubles associated with living life to the full by looking at how jesss brother turned out there are various instances where brad pitt and his lives run in parallel for example when jesss brother takes craig sheffer to a disjointed bar and subsequently he finds brad pitt there a few days later the dramatic irony was there so craig sheffers character would have a bigger emotional turmoil at his brothers death knowing he could have done more to prevent it and subsequently creates a more compelling mood in the film<SEP>1
sniper gives a true new meaning to war movies i remember movies about vietnam or wwii lots of firing everybody dies bam bam sniper takes war to a new level or refinement the movie certainly conveys all of the emotions it aims for - the helplessness of humans in the jungle the hatred and eventual trust between beckett and miller and the rush of the moment when they pull the trigger a seemingly low-budget film makes up for every flaw with action suspense and thrill because when it comes down to it its just one shot one kill<SEP>1
i cant agree with any of the comments first time i saw the film on a uk tv channel it was presented as an indie film and if you take the film under this angle i think its an all different matter i couldnt believe what i was seeing and got hooked instantly the plot may be as bad as a jss show ie there is no plot but the acting is wicked its hilarious and its all in all an incredible trash movie it says as much about america than a bully or a ken park without the drama perspective but it gives a glimpse on the us society and more precisely on what afternoon tv viewers in america and i believe there are plenty of them ! are interested in after all its the neighbours were talking about dont we 100% fun !<SEP>1
this film was in one word amazing! i have only seen it twice and have been hunting it everywhere a beautiful ensemble of older screen gems who still have that energy judy denchs ability to carry the whole film was amazing her subtle chemistry with the knight in stolen armour was great<SEP>1
typical de palma movie made with lots of style and some scenes that will bring you to the edge of your seatmost certainly the thing that makes this movie better as the average thriller is the style it has some brilliantly edited scenes and some scenes that are truly nerve wrecking that will bring you to the edge of your seat the best scenes from the movie; the museum scene and the elevator murder there are some mild erotic scenes and the movies pace might not be fast enough for the casual viewer to fully appreciate this movie so this movie might not be suitable for everybodythe story itself is also quite good but it really is the style that makes the movie work! it might be for the fans only but also casual viewers should appreciate the well build up tension in the moviethere are some nice character portrayed by a good cast michael caine is an interesting casting choice and angie dickinson acts just as well as she is good looking not bad for a 49-year old!the musical score by pino donaggio is also typically de palma like and suits the movie very well just like his score for the other de palma movie body doublebrilliant nerve wrecking thriller i love de palma!1010<SEP>1
for starters i didnt even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet i have not once seen it on tv before in my country and a lot of people do not usually know about this show it is a pity though because this is easily the most original and clever animation i have witnessed in yearsi dont hand out 10 points a lot but this is one show that truly deserves all 10 points even though at first glance this might seem like a typical cartoon but keep in mind that this is not a kids-show though when the complete story unfolds itself you know that this is a real deep storyline with a spiritual message this spiritual part of the story is largely based off spirit-animals a old indian believe that has been preserved for many years this gives the show a original twist that you cant often find in animated showsthe overall design is also something very different at times it resembles spawn a bit in terms of gritty design and other times it takes on a more cartoony approach i believe david feiss who also created and directed cow and chicken animated a segment in the show as he also drew that segment in the comicif you are looking for a mind-twisting show a show that takes on various subjects such as reality suicide spirituality life then this is something you should not miss once you begin watching you are probably going to watch it to the end one minor fact may be that the show takes on less material from the comic but this is not too annoying the only question remains though where is the dvd!<SEP>1
the story behind this movie is very interesting and in general the plot is not so bad but the details: writing directing continuity pacing action sequences stunts and use of cg all cheapen and spoil the filmfirst off action sequences they are all quite unexciting most consist of someone standing up and getting shot making no attempt to run fight dodge or whatever even though they have all the time in the world the sequences just seem bland for something made in 2004the cg features very nicely rendered and animated effects but they come off looking cheap because of how they are usedpacing: everything happens too quickly for example elle is trained to fight in a couple of hours and from the start can do back-flips etc why is she so acrobatic none of this is explained in the movie as lilith she wouldnt have needed to be able to do back flips - maybe she couldnt since she had wingsalso we have sequences like a woman getting run over by a car and getting up and just wandering off into a deserted room with a sink and mirror and then stabbing herself in the throat all for no apparent reason and without any of the spectators really caring that she just got hit by a car and then felt the secondary effects of another exploding car are you okay asks the driver yes im fine she says bloodied and disheveledi watched it all though because the introduction promised me that it would be interesting but in the end the poor execution made me wish for anything else: blade vampire hunter d even that movie with vampires where jackie chan was comic relief because they managed to suspend my disbelief but this just made me want to shake the director awake and give the writer a good talking to<SEP>0
i am one of jehovahs witnesses and i also work in an acute care medical facility over the years i have seen people die from hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions have attended numerous conferences on blood born pathogens and have seen several patients become seriously ill from pathogens induced by transfused blood i have also heard several jehovahs witnesses being told that they will die if they refuse blood and after 26 years in the field i have never actually seen it happen leaving the question is it really unreasonable to refuse blood transfusions or is the community at large benefiting from the battle on this issue the issue for jehovahs witnesses is a moral one you must abstain from blood is not an ambiguous statement thank you for this movie and allowing comments on it<SEP>1
i must have seen this a dozen times over the years i was about fifteen when i first saw it in b & w on the local pbs stationi bought a dvd set for the children to see and am making them watch it they dont teach history in school and this explains the most critical event of the 20th century it expands their critical thinkingimpartially with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why it details what lead up to the war and the actual warbuy it for your children along with alistair cookes america watch it with them and make them understand youll be so glad you did<SEP>1

i have to say that this tv movie was the work that really showed how talented melissa joan hart is we are so used to now seeing her in a sitcom and i really hope that a tv station will show this tv movie again soon as it will show the sabrina fans that mjh shines in a drama seen as we have watched her on sabrina now for now 5 years and so to give the viewers a taste of her much unused talent would be a plus melissa plays her role so well in this wanting her parents done away with so she can be with the guy she loves one thing that all sabrina viewers will notice melissa works with david lascher in this well before he took the role of josh on sabrina so it would be kind of neat to see this currently whenever it gets aired again hopefully mjh gets some good roles in movies or even in more tv movies sort of like kellie martin who has always shined in tv movies lots of unused talent waiting to bust out when it comes to melissa joan hart you shine always melissa!!!<SEP>1
mysterious murders in a european village seem the result of the vampire bat horde plaguing the terrified communitythis surprisingly effective little thriller was created by majestic pictures one of hollywoods poverty row studios the sparse production values and rough editing actually add to its eerie atmosphere and lend it an almost expressionistic quality overall it leaves the viewer the feeling of being caught up in a bad dream which is appropriate for a thriller of this sorteven though the eventual explanation for the hideous crimes is quite ludicrous and is not given proper plot development the film can boast of a good cast grave lionel atwill gives another one of his typically fine performances this time as a doctor doing scientific research in an old castle beautiful fay wray plays his assistant in a role which requires her to do little more than look lovely & alarmed dour melvyn douglas appears as the perplexed police inspector who also happens to be conveniently miss wrays boyfriendmaude eburne who could be extremely funny given the right situation steals most of her scenes as miss wrays hypochondriac aunt elderly lionel belmore plays the villages terrified burgermeister and little dwight frye who will always be remembered for his weird roles in the frankenstein and dracula films here is most effective as a bat-loving lunatic<SEP>1
this film is not about a cat and mouse fight as stated in the other comment its about a cat that has used up 8 of its 9 lives and now lives in fear of loosing its last one the cat is jumpy and scared to death all of the time hence the name fraidy cat fraidy cats previous lives haunt him as ghosts which are from different eras in time and are constantly trying to kill him off but he is most fearful of the ninth life which is represented as a cloud in the shape of a number 9 and spits out lighting bolts very old now but would still be fun for the kids if you got hold of a copy i watched this movie almost every day as a child :o<SEP>1
the clichéd polynesian males drink fight and make a stream of sexist stupid and unfunny remarks real life polynesians are much funnier than these stereotyped cardboard characters the supposedly samoan girl didnt look or act samoan at all seemed more like the stock white female who has sex with anyone on a whim with weak as water story lines you cant say anything about the acting - even the most brilliant actors could do nothing with this script its sad to see polynesian actors willing to play such sad stereotypes in a film with not one good scene and only two or three jokes what a waste of kiwi taxpayers money what a lost opportunity to make a great film about a vibrant community its better not to make movies if theyre as bad and mindless as this<SEP>0
i just saw hot millions on tcm and i had completely forgotten this gem ustinov creates a clever and divisive plot that has him cleverly going from two bit con man to ingenious well youll see maggie smith is perfect as the bumbling secretaryneighbor who has a tough time holding a job but has a warm and vibrant personality that beams through in this picture she creates a fine portrayal of a warm witty and real person who in the long runwellmolden and newhart as top executives take on the challenge of making what could be banal roles and make them come out into a comic life of their own robert morley and ceasar romero are just a pleasure to see and i know at least in romeros case ustinov is extending a helping hand of work this film is meant to be a shot back at the rising computer age and its problems for the average con man or man for that matter but in fact the characters are so involving and so much fun to watch that the computer sub plot is almost losti say almostlet down your usual expectations of modern comedy and look for the great performances and friendly forgiving and deeply involving plot in this picture<SEP>1

guy walking around without motive i will never get those two hours of my life back the guy kept on assuming identities and cheating on his pregnant wife what was i thinking how did this win a price anywhere i understood he loved his father but other than that the movie was completely senseless to me what was the purpose of walking so much and going to the funeral of a stranger for no apparent reason how did this enrich his life why did we have to see the dying old lady on her underwear!!! why!!!!i though it would be deep or about something more interesting i do not recommend the movie even to leave on while sleeping<SEP>0
if you are going to attempt building tension in a film it is always a good idea not to build it beyond the point of total tediumunfortunately the butcher brothers havent grasped this yetthis film sucks unlike the majority of its characters who if you didnt work out they are vampires in the first few minutes then shame on you preference stringing up the plentiful supply of no one knows where i am cheerleader types and homosexual drifters that waft conveniently and with a fast food swagger past their isolated doorthe only tiny bit of originality in the plot is how these vampires come to be vampires in the first place but the rest of it is ludicrous and sloppyforced to up sticks as opposed stakes on a regular basis due to their penchant for filling their basement with bloodless corpses they really are none too bright if they fed their victims they could run their own little blood farm and it would cut down on the mortality rate thereby allowing them to settle down and get chintzywhy the producers felt it necessary to introduce the incestuous twins and the homicidally gay older brother i am not sure it added zero to the plot which was unfortunate given that there wasnt a great deal of plot to start with and had no shock value at allone was never told why the parents had died unless of course that was explained during one of my frequent tea breaks clearly the social worker must have been alerted to the family for some reason or other but again it was for the viewer to write their own reasonthe only well rounded character was the youngest brother who emerges looking like pugsley from the adams family indeed he was way too rounded having the appearance of a child who has inadvertently wandered from a weight watchers class in to a very bad horror film oh heavens he had never mind dear have another doughnut with a yummy blood centre<SEP>0
being that i am not a fan of snoop dogg as an actor that made me even more anxious to check out this flick i remember he was interviewed on jay leno and said that he turned down a role in the big-budget adam sandler comedy the longest yard to be in this film so obviously snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he has acting chops im not going to overpraise snoop for his performance in the tenants there are certainly better rapperactors like mos def who couldve done more with his role but the point is snoop did a good job he cant seem to shake off some of his trademark body movements and vocal inflections but thats something even jack nicholson has a problem doing the point is i found him convincing in the role and the tension between him and dylan mcdermotts character captivating mcdermott by the way gives the best performance in the film though his subtle acting will most likely be overshadowed by snoops not-so-subtle acting being a big reader and aspiring writer myself i couldnt help but find the characters and plot somewhat fascinating it did aggravate me how snoops character would constantly ask mcdermott to read his work and berate him for criticizing it but you know what im sure a lot of writers are like that his character was supposed to be flawed as was mcdermotts in his own way my only mild criticism of the film would be its ending for some reason it just felt too rushed for me though the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters rather than plot<SEP>1
corean cinema can be quite surprising for an occidental audience because of the multiplicity of the tones and genres you can find in the same movie in a coreen drama such as this secret sunshine youll also find some comical parts thriller scenes and romantic times theres not only tragedy in life theres also tragic-comedy says at one point of the movie the character interpreted by song kang-ho summing up the mixture of the picture but dont get me wrong this heterogeneity of the genres the movie deals with adds veracity to the experience this rich movie offers to its spectators that doesnt mean that it lacks unity : on the contrary its rare to see such a dense and profound portrait of a woman in painshin-ae whos in quest for a quiet life with her son in the native town of her late husband really gives by all the different faces of suffering shes going through unity to this movie its realistic part is erased by the psychological descriptions of all the phases the poor mother is going through denial lost anger faith pert of reality : the movie fallows all the steps the character crosses and looks like a psychological catalog of all the suffering phases a woman can experiencethe only thing is to accept what may look like a conceptual experience the woman wears the mask of tragedy the man represents the comical interludes and to let the artifices of the movie touch you i must say that some parts of the movie really did move me especialy in the beginning particularly those concerning the unability of chang joan to truly help the one he loves but also that the accumulation of suffering emotionally tired me towards the end nevertheless some cinematographic ideas are really breathtaking and surprising the scene where a body is discovered in a large shot is for instance amazing this kind of scenes makes secret sunshine the melo equivalent of the host for horror movies or memories of murder for thrillers these movies are indeed surprising most original aesthetically incredible and manage to give another dimension to the genres they deal with the only thing that secret sunshine forgets as the host forgot to be scary is to make its audience cry : bad point for a melodrama but good point for a good film<SEP>1
this is probably one of the most original love stories i have seen for ages especially for a war based briefly film basically it is a story based in two worlds one obviously real the other fictitious but the filmmakers say at the beginning that it is only coincidence if it is a real place anyway peter carter the great david niven was going to crash in a plane he talked to june planet of the apes kim hunter before he bailed out and said he loved her he was meant to die from jumping without a parachute but somehow he survived and now he is seeing and loving june in the flesh this other place like a heaven is unhappy because he survived and was meant to come to their world so they send french conductor 71 marius goring to persuade him to go but he is obviously in love peter suggests to him that he should appeal to keep his life to the other worlds court he is granted this obviously love prevails when the two lovers announce that they would die for each other june even offers to take his place! also starring robert coote as bob trubshawe kathleen byron as an angel a brief then unknown lord sir richard attenborough as an english pilot and abraham sofaer as the judgethe surgeon david niven was number 36 on the 50 greatest british actors the film was number 86 on the 100 greatest tearjerkers for the happy ending it was number 47 on the 100 greatest war films it was number 46 on the 50 greatest british films and it was number 59 on the 100 greatest films outstanding!<SEP>1
the invisible ray is an excellent display of both the acting talents of boris karloff and bela lugosi karloff pulls off a flawless performance as a sullen and conflicted scientist who appears to put his scientific achievements ahead of his relationships with others even his wife his already loner personality becomes unbearable as he becomes paranoidlugosi plays the consummate professional who is passionate about his work but still finds time to maintain on good terms with everyone but still seems to have no real close friends this was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays it very well it is hard however to hear his accent and believe he is french the biggest problem with the movie was that it was all based on junk science but in a way even the junk science makes it work well since the ideas and theories are completely idiotic they are as relevant today as they were when the movie was made and they are also as forward reaching- and always will be this is a perfectly delightful movie to watch again and again i saw it maybe 5 times this weekend and i could easily sit through it five more times the acting is marvelous and the science is amusing i highly recommend it<SEP>1
this group of english pros are a pleasure to watch the supporting cast could form a series of their own its a seen before love tiangle between the head of surgery his wife and a new pretty boy surgery resident only the superior acting skills of francesca annis michael kitchen and the sexy robson greene lift this from the trash category to a very enjoyable romp the only quibble is that its hard to accept that the smoldering francesca annis would fall in love and actually marry michael kitchen who like me is hardly an international or even a british sex symbol you can readily understand why robson green would light her fire with apologies to the doors the guy who almost steals the show with a great laid back performance is owens father david bradley watch him in the way we live now in a completely different performance to get an idea of his range daniela nardini as kitchens secretary sometime sex toy is hard to forget as the spurned mistress who makes kitchen sorry he ever looked at her great body conor mullen and julian rhind-tutt as greens sidekick surgery buddies as ive said could have their own series they are that good the whole thing is a great deal of fun and i heartily recommend it and thank you imdbman for letting the paying customers have their say in this fascinating venue<SEP>1
good horror movies from france are quite rare and its fairly easy to see why! whenever a talented young filmmaker releases a staggering new film he emigrates towards glorious hollywood immediately after to directed the big-budgeted remake of another great film classic! how can france possibly build up a solid horror reputation when their prodigy-directors leave the country after just one film haute tension was a fantastic movie and it earned director alexandre aja a one-way ticket to the states to remake the hills have eyes which he did terrifically i may add eric valettes long-feature debut maléfique was a very promising and engaging horror picture too and hes already off to the hollywood as well to direct the remake of takashi miikes ghost-story hit one missed call so there you have it two very gifted frenchmen that arent likely to make any more film in their native country some time soon maléfique is a simple but efficient chiller that requires some patience due to its slow start but once the plot properly develops it offers great atmospheric tension and a handful of marvelous special effects the film almost entirely takes place in one single location and only introduces four characters were inside a ramshackle french prison cell with four occupants the new arrival is a businessman sentenced to do time for fraud the elderly and wise inmate sadistically killed his wife and then theres a crazy transvestite and a mentally handicapped boy to complete the odd foursome they find an ancient journal inside the wall of their cell belonging to a sick murderer in the 1920s who specialized in black magic rites and supernatural ways to escape the four inmates begin to prepare their own escaping plan using the bizarre formulas of the book only to realize the occult is something you shouldnt mess with eric valette dedicates oceans of time to the character drawings of the four protagonists which occasionally results in redundant and tedious sub plots but his reasons for this all become clear in the gruesome climax when the book suddenly turns out to be some type of wishmaster-device maléfique is a dark film with truckloads of claustrophobic tension and several twisted details about human behavior watch it before some wealthy american production company decides to remake it with four handsome teenage actors in the unconvincing roles of hardcore criminals<SEP>1
ive had a lot of experience with women in russia and this movie portrays what a lot of them are like unfortunately they are very cunning ruthless and greedy as well as highly unfair from the robotic sex the hustling for gifts to the lies and betrayal ive experienced it all in russiai know what im talking about and here are my qualifications: here are the photojournals of my three trips to russia in search of a bride it includes thousands of pics of many hot russian girls i met black comedy scams i was privy to and the story of my mugging and appearance on russian national tvhttp:wwwhappierabroadcomphotojournalshtmits like reality tv you will love it i spent a ton of time putting it together so check it out the russian woman that nicole kidman plays is a lot like the julia and katya in my photojournalsmy 3 bride seeking trips in russia happen to be very exciting and would sell so why dont they make a movie out of my bride seeking adventures in russia however there is one factual impossibility in this film and that is the way which the guy orders his bride from a catalog and having her arrive at an airport it doesnt work that way at all so i dont understand why the media likes to perpetuate this there isnt a single russian bride introduction website that works this way and i challenge anyone to find one that does the fact is you can only order the russian ladys contact info email address phone number etc from the website from there you correspond and then visit her and if you want to bring her to your country you start the immigration process at your ins office and wait months after that thats how it works in real life you cant just order her to arrive at your airport us immigration would never allow such a thing to happenwumaster - i got everything i wanted by going abroad! you can too! http:wwwhappierabroadcom<SEP>1
i enjoy watching people doing breakdance especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes of this movie which takes you to a disco club called roxy especially at christmas time because there also appears a mc santa clauseven if this is an old film and even if i have videotaped it from tv when the state movie archive of finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen i went there to check it out its much more enjoyable on big screen than on tveven if many people here think that watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost i disagree with this and i think that when i paid my ticket i got the moneys worth by seeing this as it is on big screen especially seated on front row of the cinema an unforgettable experience and much better than just on video<SEP>1
i second the motion to make this into a movie it would be great!! i was also amazed at the storyline and character build in this game i have played it again and again over 20 times just to try something different and it gets more interesting every time final fantasy eat your heart out!! this should be made into a movie!!!!! if anyone out there wants some help to start a petition to have this made into a movie please contact me i would love to help with that project any day the graphics are great for ps1 and even make you forget it is ps1 most of the time the multitude of side quests makes it different every time you play<SEP>1
simply i found the tv show mash trite preachy oh ever so politically correct repetitious pretentious and biggest sin of all and that is that it is was incredibly dull you have alan alda as the main lead star who is so in love with himself and his cleverness that it actually made me uncomfortable to even try and sit through an episode the original series had both mclean stevson and wayne rogers whom ill happily admit had a certain panache and style to their character presentation however harry henry morgan and mike farrell both singularly and compositely together is like eating caviar and fresh oysters with wonder bread loretta swit which i also found dull also to no fault of her own wasnt a wonder to look at and gary burghoff who was good in the movie got tired looking and acting as the show wore on seeing one show a year showed that to me jamie farr was just low brow comedy and is not even worth really mentioning here at all the reason i did not give it a one rating which anyone reading this by now would be wondering is that ratings of any sort is not only a subjective call but a relative one television except for relatively few exceptions is such crud that relatively speaking mash had some production quality by television standards of that era and today and therefore it is deserved of a two rob ritter<SEP>0
when i saw this movie first it was long ago on vhs-video i did like this movie because it was funny and excitingly some years ago i saw another movie called: *andy colbys incredible adventure* in this movie were parts of *wizards of the lost kingdom* used in they called this movie kor the conquerer i began to search for the kor-movie many years because i wanted to see the complete movie not only the parts which were used in the *andy colby*-movie no shop had this kor-movie to rent and no shop did know this movie many years i watched my old vhs-tapes i had at home and what a wonder i had this movie since many years still at home but the movie had a different title because in germany it has 3 or 4 titles so i was happy to find this tape at home and this time i had much more time in watching *kor the conquerer again the music is great during the hole movie but the best part of filming in combination with the music is this moment when kor is walking drunken through the green forrest the music in the background had some kind of magic i like bo svenson and also the boy who played simon in the movie both of them did their job very good manfred kraatz germany 26102004 thanks to all for reading my comment<SEP>1
buddy is an entertaining family film set in a time when humanizing animals and making them cute was an accepted way to get people to be interested in thembased on a true story buddy shows the great love that the main characters have for animals and for each other and that they will do anything for each otherwhile not a perfect movie the animated gorilla is quite lifelike most of the time and the mayhem that occurs within the home is usually amusing for childrenthis film misses an opportunity to address the mistake of bringing wild animals into the home as pets but does show the difficultiesa recommended film which was the first for jim henson productions<SEP>1
unfortunately the movie is more concerned with making lame social commentary on a real event but doesnt have the balls to legitimately document what happened the constant rhetoric of how violent video games are not to blame i get the impression ben coccio is an avid gamer or how media and music is completely devoid of influence is the obvious message we even get a laughable scene of the two boys burning all their cds talk about subtlety! but the movie only gets away with it because its fiction nice try yes its a great idea to relieve media of influence but how do we know the kids that have actually planned and executed a school shooting werent influenced by media or video games we dont and we wont with this movie because once again these kids are smart enough to completely relinquish the media yet dumb enough to scorch a nazi symbol on the ground haha i somehow dont think sothe movie bats you over the head with its portrayal of the normalcy of the families its almost doing a disservice to think that there wasnt a serious flaw in the family dynamic of kids that have actually gone out and shot their fellow schoolmates why is everyone so concerned with making killers seem normal when they are so obviously not a completely false and phony depiction<SEP>0
i loved this series when it was on kids wb i didnt believe that there was a batman spin off seeing as the original show ended in 1995 and this show came in 1997 first of all i loved the idea of robin leaving batman to solve crime on his own it was an interesting perspective to their relationship i also liked the addition of tim drake in the series and once again like its predecessor this show had great story lines great animation better then the original fantastic voice work and of course brilliant writing the only thing that i didnt like was that was when it was in the us it would often run episodes in a 15 minute storyline i just wish some of the episodes could be longer my favorite episode of any batman cartoons comes in this series and its called over the edge in my opinion as good if not better then heart of ice and robins reckoning overall a nice follow up along with superman this show made my childhood very happy<SEP>1
what is most disturbing about this film is not that school killing sprees like the one depicted actually happen but that the truth is they are carried out by teenagers like cal and andrenormal kids with normal families by using a hand held camera technique a la blair witch ben coccio succeeds in bringing us into the lives of two friends who have some issues with high school although we arent ever told exactly what is behind those issues they seem to be typical -a lot of people hate high school so what a part of you just doesnt believe they will ever carry out the very well thought out massacre on zero day the surveillance camera scenes in the school during the shooting are made all the more powerful for that reason you cant believe its really happening and that its really happened the hand held camera technique also creates the illusion that this is not a scripted movie a brilliant idea given the subject matter<SEP>1
this is a quite slow paced movie slowly building the story of an ex stripper who begins a new family life with a complete stranger the viewer slowly feels that theres something wrong here i really loved this movie even though it leaves a slight bitter taste in the end it is clever well paced and very well acted both philippe toretton and emmannuelle seigner are deeply into their characters the little son pierrot is also very touchinga thriller which does not seem like one a very unconventional movie very particular atmosphere throughout the whole movie though you might feel awkward a few times with a couple of scenesill give it a 810 !!<SEP>1
the film had some likable aspects perhaps too many for my taste it felt as though the writerdirector was desperately trying to get us to feel the inner conflict of all of its characters not once a few timesbut all of the time this is the job of television not cinema the location of the train station was well chosen and i enjoyed sascha horlers performance as the pregnant friend i felt as though justine clarkes performance was wan her reactions to things felt forced as though the director were trying to vocalise the themes of the film through her protagonists expressions i also cant believe that a director can make the wonderful daniela farinacci into an unbelievable presence i cannot understand the choice of pop music slapped over entire sequences this is a lazy device especially where the pop music comes from no place diagetic to the film andor where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly earnest that said there is a breezy quality about the film that evokes the australian heat and local attitude with originality it does create an atmosphere of heat and sunshine especially with the usage of wonderful animation sequences that rescue the film from complete mediocrity infusing it with passion and hand-crafted charm i am curious why the dialogue feels so overworked who knows if theres a god like some guy sitting there up in the sky telling us what to do or whatever the line was perhaps one of the more embarrassing moments was the friend returning home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to declare to his wife im giving up smoking an anti-smoking commercial a tac ad with some tasteful animation i had to leave the cinema at the 50 minute mark -- it was all too much<SEP>0
my wife and i have watched this movie twice both of us used to be in the military besides being funny as hell it offers a very realistic view of life in the navy from the perspective of a navy enlisted man and tells it like it really is were adding this movie to our permanent collection !<SEP>1
though derivative labyrinth still stands as the highlight of the mid-half of the six-year-old show finally a story allows welling to show how he has grown as an actor its not easy playing a character that is the embodiment of truth justice and the american way on a weekly basis with very little variation his performance permitting him to show how one might react if heshe discovers that all that he knew may be a lie was quite believablewelling rose to the occasion marvelouslyas always michael rosenbaum as the handicapped lex delivered as did kristen kreuk as a too-sweet-to-be-believed lana allison mack the ever-present chloe also scored as a slightly off-her-rocker versionthe use of an annoying hum in the background added to the tone of the installment and made for an engaging drama<SEP>1
i was interested to see the move thinking that it might be a diamond in the rough but the only thing i found was bad writing horrible directing the shot sequences do not flow even though the director might say that that is what he is going for it looks very uninspired and immature the editing could have been done by anyone with 2 vcrs and the stock was low budget video i would say that it wasnt even something as simple as mini digital video there are some simple ways to fix a film with what the director has like through editing etc but it is obvious that he just doesnt care there is as much effort put in to this movie as a ham sandwich it could be made better but that would mean extra work<SEP>0
this movie was bad this movie was horrible the acting was bad the setting was unrealistic the story was absurd: a comet that appears once in eons is set to appear one night most of the worlds population decided to watch this comet then the next morning everyone but a select few of people has been turned to dust from the comets radiation peoples clothes are still intact there are plants which are still alive but the people were turned to dust no bones nothing thats ridiculous how can radiation incinerate people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intacteven better the comet mutated some people into zombie flesh eating monsters their makeup would not have even looked frightening to a newborn child the insane clown posse scare me moreand theyre supposed to look stupidthen there were the survivors people who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombie-dom and death how can steel block a comets radiation that supposedly incinerates people in their tracksequally insulting is the 60s horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie or the 80s hair rock which serves no purpose in the film and makes you want to shoot your televisionthe stupidest part of the movie however are the characters it focuses on: two valley girls and chakotay from star trek: voyager these three characters were totally unrealistic who would go looting the day after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere there were four 5 minute horror scenes in the entire movie and most of them were dreams in between these scenes is unsophisticated dialog which makes south park seem intelligent the silence in between the elementary dialog was painful i could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a bag of cheetos dont see this movie ever<SEP>0
zp is deeply related to that youth dream represented by the hippie movementthe college debate in the beginning of the movie states the cultural situation that gives birth to that movement the explosion that daria imagines represents the fall of all social structures and therefore the development of all that huge transformation that society is suffering through and finally marks death anticipates the end that a sees for the movement itself the film will be more easily understood if we go back to that time in life during the 60 and 70 young people were the driving force for the profound explorations for change one of the more significant changes intended was to bring sexuality out of the closet and i think the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would perform in the hipotetic situation where there would be nobody to hide from i watched the scene where the couples would throw sand to each other and appreciated the magnificent way in which a depicted the impossibility to continue hiding this basic human instinct repression was the way to control social outbursts at that time and that is the method police applies to stop the students this society suffers from hipocresy and that comes clear when the students gain access to weapons skipping all fake controls the dialogue between the policeman with the college professor whos detained for no reason shows part of society interested for this youth feeling and part completely uninterested presenting flying as the more accurate symbol for freedom the stealing of the plane represents mark s inner wish for it but his going back or coming back or returning segun shows the difficulties to come free from these bonds and as i ve said a depicts the death of the dream by these difficulties winning the game in my point of view a film to remember<SEP>1
the film began with wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend her aunt edna may oliver--a person too talented for this film didnt like wheeler--a sentiment i can easily relate to the aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from wheeler they left and wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king at about the same time woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king so when wheeler arrived it was up to the boys to fight it out but they refused because they are already friends--which greatly disappointed the people as killing and replacing kings is a national pastimei am a huge fan of comedy from the golden age of hollywood--the silent era through the 1940s i have seen and reviewed hundreds if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films i have never been able to understand the appeal of wheeler and woolsey--the only comedy team that might be as bad as the ritz brothers! despite being very successful in their short careers in hollywood cut short due to the early death of robert woolsey i cant help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better for example there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the marx brothers film duck soup yet cracked nuts never made me laugh and duck soup was a silly and highly enjoyable romp at times woolsey talked a bit like groucho but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! in fact he just seemed to prattle pointlessly his only funny quality was that he looked goofy--surely not enough reason to put him on film additionally wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese--a piece of cheese that sang very poorly! a missed opportunity was the old vaudeville routine later popularized by abbott and costello as whos on first which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing in fact soon after they started their spiel they just ended the routine--so prematurely that you are left frustrated i knew that whos on first had been around for many years and used by many teams but i really wanted to see wheeler and woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twistonce again i have found yet another sub-par film by this duo while i must admit that i liked a few of their films mildly such as silly billies and the rainmakers--which i actually gave 6s to on imdb this one was a major endurance test to complete--something that i find happens all too often when i view the films of wheeler and woolsey where was all the humor!<SEP>0

i am a big fan of arnold vosloo finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie not just a bit part made me happyunfortunately i took film appreciation in college and the only thing i can say that i didnt like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loosi have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired but arnold is an excellent actor i have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desiredi love arnold vosloo and he made the film viewable otherwise i would have written it off as another lousy filmi found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good but the sound effects of the shoot-out were pretty bad there are some glitches in the film continuity but they are overlookable considering the low-caliber of the filmall in all i enjoyed the film because arnold vosloo was in itjackie<SEP>0
i have to admit this movie moved me to the extent that i burst in tears however i always think about things twice and instead of writing a eulogy that would define the film as flawless and impeccable i prefer taking the risk of a closer lookfirst whats first: the movie has an undeniable impact on the viewer simply because it starts out and continues as a slow-paced movie that doesnt try to blow you away with the actual scenes from 911 thumbs up for this stroke of genius because unlike stones world trade center this film fortunately doesnt focus on the attack itself but on the fallout which similar to the fallout of a nuclear explosion is hardly visible but nonetheless dangerous and devastating the psychological impact the sheer devastation that 911 caused and the havoc it wreaked on the american people is almost palpable in this movie i think binder managed an astute observation of the american post 911 society and sandler in my opinion sky rocketed from an average comedy actor to a real talent who delivers a performance worthy of an oscarhowever: in the film blood diamond the di caprio character says and i quote: ah these americans always want to take about their feelings now i dont want to belittle their sufferíngs but i sure would like to make a comparison ever since 911 the entire world is confronted with mementos memorials and commemorations of 911 the hollywood industry and writers such as safran foer more than allude to 911 in their works now this huge amount of cultural products dealing with 911 turn the death of 3000 people into the biggest tragedy of this young century the number of books written on the subject and the number of films directed on this subject and i say this with all due respect blow the importance of this atrocious crime somewhat out of proportionfact is: people die every day due to unjust actions and horrible crimes committed by bad or simply lost people we have a war in iraq in afghanistan in birma and lots of other countries on a daily basis we forget about the poverty the african people suffer from and we tend do empathize with them to a lesser degree than with the american victims of 911 simply because they are black and because their lives dont have much in common with our western lives africa neither has the money nor the potential to commemorate their national tragedies in a way america can so what i am saying is this: the reason why we feel more for the 3000 victims of 911 and their families is because we are constantly reminded of 911 not a day goes by without a newspaper article a film or a book that discusses 911in conclusion: i commiserated with charlie fineman but i wasnt sure whether i had the right to feel for him more than for a hutu who lost his entire family in the rwandan civil waryou catch my thrift<SEP>1
although super mario 64 isnt like the rest of the games in the series it is still a classic and is every bit as good as the old games games with this much replay value are few and far between plus this game has so much variety there are 15 levels each with several different tasks you can do and many other hidden tasks the game isnt very challenging but its lack of challenge doesnt take away from the game at all once you beat it youll want to erase your game and start again and its just as much fun the second time or third time or two hundredth time a must own for any nintendo 64 owner and is a reason in itself to own a nintendo 64<SEP>1
first of all i need to say that im portuguese and its not usual to me spend my time watching portuguese movies probably one each year or even noneand the reason is the almost generalized idea between the portuguese people that the national pictures are awful really close to the worst ever made! however in the last decade it starts to surprises me when we get back the funny of the 40s when leão da estrela e costa do castelo were among the worlds best of their time with movies like pulsação zero or sorte nula both from director fernando fragata and also with some actors and music in commonthis one is also good not of the same kind because it isnt a true comedy; in fact its officially a drama a womans drama the has some unexpected funny parts cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them like the hypothetical travel to the caribbean just to get laid the plot works and can surprise us a few times; the actors are fine the locations regular as the score; but the truth is that it all make sense then we can count it as a nice effort for the national cinema that seems to be starting from the ashes as the phoenixif you want to watch a portuguese movie surely you can take better option but it stills one to be measured<SEP>1
was this movie stupid yup did this movie depth nope character development nope plot twists nope this was simply a movie about a highly-fictionalized springer show it shows the lengths that some people will go to get their mugs on tv molly hagan did a great job as jaime presslys mom jaime iswellgorgeous! this flick wasnt so much made to be a breakthrough movie rather it was intended to life in a trailer park i live in a trailer park and ours is nothing like the one in this movie where everyone sleeps with everyone else all the girls get pregnant by different guys and all the guys drive rusted-out 66 ford pickups exaggeration of course but thats the picture everyone sees when you mention trailer park some people over-analyze movies case-in-point: star trek freaks i watch movies purely for the entertainment value; not to point out that the girl is wearing a different shirt in a different scene read the goofs bit about connies shirt could it have been better sure but it was funny as hell<SEP>0
what was the worst movie of 2003 cat in the hat gigli mais non! i propose that it was this atrocious little film from earlier in the year badly written badly edited and if i may be so bold badly acted the order is the black hole of film - a movie so dense not even the slightest bit of entertainment could escape from its event horizon of suck it isnt even accidentally funny like for example showgirlsyou know that the producers are assuming that their audience isnt going to be very smart they renamed the movie originally titled the sin eaters because they figured americans were too stupid to understand what a sin eater was even though they go to great lengths to explain what a sin eater is in the movie instead they figure an utterly generic title and a picture of heath ledger looking sullen are more than enough to get you in thereand hey what do you know they were right! my ex-girlfriend saw the picture of heath and dragged me in congratulations producers youve met your target market she also liked grease ii so youre in good companyback on topic heath plays a catholic monk from a specific you guessed it order that is trying to investigate the murder of his mentor he has celibacy issues possibly because nobody in their right mind would believe that he knew the slightest thing about religion much less be a celibate monk the only other member of this order is a funny alcoholic fat guy as much as ive wanted to see the return of the funny alcoholic to the big screen his attempts at humor reminded me of all the dorks in my high school who did imitations of monty python thinking that if they just said the lines like the pythons did they would automatically be funny you know the sort of people im talking aboutif i utter any more i would be in danger of generating spoilers frankly the thing that spoiled this movie for me was the fact that it was created<SEP>0
kaabee depicts the hardship of a woman in pre and during wwii raising her kids alone after her husband imprisoned for thought crime this movie was directed by yamada youji and as expected the atmosphere of this movie is really wonderful although the historical correctness of some scenes most notably the beach scene is a suspectthe acting in this movie is absolutely incredible i am baffled at how they managed to gather this all-star cast for a 2008 film yoshinaga sayuri possibly the most decorated still-active actress in japan will undoubtedly win more individual awards for her performance in this film shoufukutei tsurube in a supporting role was really nice as well it was asano tadanobu though who delivered the most impressive performance perfectly portraying the wittiness of his character and the difficult situation he was infilms with pre-war setting is not my thing but thanks to wonderful directing and acting i was totally absorbed by the story also it wasnt a far-left nonsense like yuunagi no machi sakura no kuni and examines the controversial and sensitive issue of government oppression and brainwashing that occurred in that period in japan excellent film highly recommended for all viewers<SEP>1
the movie began well enough it had a fellow get hit by a glowing green meteorite getting superpowers telekinesis x-ray vision invulnerability flight the ability to speak to dogs superspeed heat vision and the ability to make plants grow large and quickly and fighting crime from there on its all downhillmeteor man gets a costume from his mom fights with the resident gangs and has many aborted encounters with the gang leaders which serves to set you up for the disappointing overlong and stupefying endingit wouldnt be so remarkably bad if it werent like watching a boxing match where the two fighters pretend to hit each other while the audience stands looking onward while the fighters just continue to dancedespite all of this nonsense the movie has good points it states clearly that if you try to take on a gang alone then theyll come back to your home and hurt you it states that gangs & communities need to see their real enemies the big bosses that use them for their own ends to crush honest people into a ghetto existence it also states that people do not need superheroes if they are willing to work as a community do destroy the predators that harm them the only message it really lacks is that the voters should ensure their elected officials rudolph giuliani marion barry ronald reagan george w bush & george hw bush arent crooks too<SEP>0
ghost of dragstrip hollow appears to take place in a spotless netherworld an era long gone by where the biggest sin a kid could commit would be in defying the law and getting a traffic ticket it opens with a young female auto fanatic getting the business from her arch rival who pressures her into a car race thats about it for the drag-racing--this b-flick is mostly concerned with rock n roll man! the folks at american international were obviously fond of decent square teens who liked to party and yet didnt mind an adult chaperone there are a few amusing double entendres and fruity exchanges necking kid: we thought wed come out for some fresh airdad: where did you think youd find it down her throat but the ghost is a little late in arriving brief at 65 minutes the movie cheats us with a climactic car race that actually takes place off-screen and a pre-scooby doo-styled unmasking which makes no sense however for nostalgia buffs some mindless fun ** from ****<SEP>0

if you played spider-man on the ps version then youve seen it all to truly experience it you should get the dc version simply put its a much graphically superior game; the textures are sharp levels are easy to navigate and it has much better sound then its ps cousin i bought this game back in late 00s and it still holds up even till this day well marvel: ultimate alliance is a much superior and strategic game but if youre a fan of ol web head then you owe it yourself to pick this up for your gaming library swinging around the city as spidey has never looked this good and dead-on in a video game if you have a dreamcast snag this up for cheap the dc version is simply incredible<SEP>1
the 60s is an occasionally entertaining film most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film it is extremely uneven and includes many annoying elements take for instance the switch between black & white and color if done right this could of been fairly effective but because it was done poorly it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience; much of the film had an odd feel to it the acting wasnt extremely bad for a made for tv flick but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times many of the events were not coherent and ending up being confusing how did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960s the ending was much too sappy for my tastes; because it was hollywoodized everything had to turn out right in the end i would advise you to not waste your time on the 60s and do something else with your time im glad i watched this in class and not on my own time i think i can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of bob dylans music those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick i hope you take my advice and stay away from this<SEP>0
when a small glob of space age silly putty lands on earth it soon begins consuming earthlings and putting on weight the only part of this senseless drivel that i enjoyed was all the cool classic cars this dog had so many holes it could be sliced and sold for swiss cheese this thing actually made 20 million bucks and mcqueens salary was 3k all were vastly overpaid the monster looked a lot like a large beanbag and the teens looked as though they could have children approaching their teen-age years and those blasts from the shotgun; sounded like a pellet rifle with a sound suppressor the ending was pitifully trite; obviously the producers were leaving the door open for a sequeland there were many thumbs down<SEP>0
i have to say i totally loved the movie it had its funny moments some heartwarming parts just all around good me personally really liked the movie because its something that finally i can relate to my childhood this movie in my opinion is geared more towards the young gay population it shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up all the taunting name-calling and not knowing is something i like most other young feminine boys will always remember and now finally a movie that illustrates how hard it really is to grow up gay so i would definitely recommend seeing this movie probably shouldnt really watch it until a person is old and mature enough to understand it<SEP>1

well this movie started out funny but quickly deteriorated i thought it would be more adult oriented humor based on the first few moments but then the movie switched into a bad made-for-disney channel type mode especially a go-kart racing scene that was incredibly long alana de la garza is gorgeous but has a really fake italian accent the movie looked and sounded very independent and low budget there was one very cute moment which ill just call the serenading scene but overall this one was a yawner the laughs are very few and far between the end surprise for mr fix it is so ridiculous it left me more mad than anything else might be worth a look if you can catch it for free or tv but dont waste your money buying or renting this movie<SEP>0
i have this film out of the library right now and i havent finished watching it it is so bad i am in disbelief audrey hepburn had totally lost her talent by then although shed pretty much finished with it in robin and marian this is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film its really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the dorothy stratten appearance just prior to her homicidethere is nothing but idiocy between gazzara and his cronies little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest palest shadowwho could believe that there are even some of the same manhattan environs that hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in breakfast at tiffanys twenty years earlier the soundtrack of old sinatra songs and the gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure dont have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at youreverting to type means going back up as well as going back down i guess in this case audrey hepburns chic european lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star here she has even lost her talent as a star if someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period like ann-margret had played the role there would have been some life in it even given the unbelievably bad material and mongoloid-level situationshepburn was a great person of course greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors after this dreadful performance she went on to make an atrocious tv movie with robert wagner called love among thieves in they all laughed it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50s even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like lana turner were infinitely more effective than is hepburn turner took acting seriously even when she was bad hepburn doesnt take it seriously at all couldnt be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky her last really good work was in two for the road perhaps her most perfect if possibly not her best in many waysand that girl who plays the country singer is just sickening john ritter is horrible there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see dorothy stratten who was truly pretty otherwise critic david thomsons oft-used phrase losing hisher talent never has made more senseben gazarra had lost all sex appeal by then and so we have 2 films with gazarra and hepburn--who could ask for anything less sandra dees last pitiful film lost from 2 years later a low-budget nothing had more to it than this at least ms dee spoke in her own voice; by 1981 audrey hepburns accent just sounded silly; shed go on to do the pbs gardens of the world with audrey hepburn and there her somewhat irritating accent works as she walks through english gardens with aristocrats or waxes effusively about what i like most is when flowers go back to nature! as in naturalized daffodils but in an actual fictional movie she just sounds ridiculousto think that breakfast at tiffanys was such a profound sort of light poetic thing with audrey hepburn one of the most beautiful women in the world--she was surely one of the most beautiful screen presences in my fair lady matching garbo in several things and delphine seyrig in last year at marienbad and then this! and her final brief role as the angel hap in the spielberg film always was just more of the lady stuff--corny witless and stiflingi went to her memorial service at the fifth avenue presbyterian church a beautiful service which included a boys choir singing the shaker hymn simple gifts the only thing not listed in the program was the sudden playing of hepburns singing moon river on the fire escape in breakfast at tiffanys and this brought much emotion and some real tears out in the congregationa great lady who was once a fine actress as in the nuns story and one of the greatest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of the 50s and 60s who became a truly bad one--thats not all that common and perhaps it is only a great human being who in making such things as film performances trivial nevertheless has the largeness of mind to want to have the flaws pointed out mercilessly--which all of her late film work contained in abundance most of the talk about hepburns miscasting is about my fair lady but the one that should have had the original actress in it was wait until dark which had starred lee remick on broadway never as celebrated as hepburn she was a better actress in many ways hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid although hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part after that all of her acting went downhill<SEP>0
jim carrey and morgan freeman along with jennifer aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this 2003 season late may and a good improvement on carreys past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies with a slightly toned down carrey antics yet with just the zap and crackle of his old self carrey powerfully carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic tearfully somber moments elements of jims real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie this delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script while still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of comedydrama bruce almightly deserves credit for being a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its good-natured taste eight out of ten stars<SEP>1
the movie starts out as an ordinary comic-hero-movie it´s about the boy who is picked on has no parents and is madly in love with the schools #1 girl nothing surprises in the movie there is nothing that you can´t guess coming in the movie toby mcguire shows us that either he is no good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like this one maybe kids around the age of ten can enjoy the film but it is a bit violent for the youngest you can´t get away from thinking of movies like x-men batman and spawn all of those titles are better i almost walked out the last 20 minutes! one thing that could have been good though was the computeranimation but not even that is anything to put in the christmas-tree! so my recomendation: don´t see this film even if you get paid for it!<SEP>0
sundown - featuring the weakest dorkiest vampires ever seen accompanied by one of the most unfitting pretentious scores ever written - and with shane the vampire whos every move and spoken word was so ridiculous that i burst out laughing half the times and rolled my eyes the restthe vampires dont seem to have any special powers at all - except for strength sometimes being able to switch off a lamp with their mind one time and thats it really ever imagine count dracula worriedly recoiling from a fight cause he ran out of bullets neither did i practically any other movie-dracula would eat this one for breakfast skin his followers and use their bones as toothpicksthe main plot of the movie is that a human family of four gets caught up in a vampire gang fight - draculas vs some old geezers it could have been some good old b-flick fun but the overly dramatic music was clearly written by someone who took this movie a bit too seriously and ends up ruining the remaining part of the movie not already ruined by clay bats mediocre acting and the laughable screenplayin the end its just too silly to be funny sure it has some amusing moments but theyre few and far apart<SEP>0
john boormans 1998 the general was hailed as a major comeback though its hard to see why on the evidence of the film itself one of three films made that year about famed northern irish criminal martin cahill alongside ordinary decent criminal and vicious circles it has an abundance of incident and style the film was shot in colour but released in b&w scope in some territories but makes absolutely no impact and just goes on forever with a main character who threatens witnesses car bombs doctors causes a hundred people to lose their jobs tries to buy off the sexually abused daughter of one of his gang to keep out of jail and nails one of his own to a snooker table yet still remains a popular local legend an attractive enough personality for his wife to not only approve but actually suggest a ménage a trios with her sister it needs a charismatic central performance to sell the character and the film it doesnt get it instead its lumbered with what may well be brendan gleesons worst and most disinterested performance: he delivers his lines and stands in the right place but theres nothing to suggest either a local hero or the inner workings of a complex character on the plus side this helps not to overglamorize a character who is nothing more than an egotistical thug but its at odds with a script that seems to be expecting us to love him and his anticstheres a minor section that picks up interest when the ira whips up a local hate campaign against the general and his men painting them as anti-social drug dealers purely because cahill wont share his loot from a robbery with them but its temporary resolution is so vaguely shot - something to do with cahill donning a balaclava and joining the protesters which were expected to find lovably cheeky - that its just thrown away things are more successful in the last third as the pressure mounts and his army falls apart but by then its too late to really care adrian dunbar maria doyle kennedy and the gorgeous angeline ball do good work in adoring supporting roles but jon voights hammy garda beat cop seems to be there more for american sales than moral balance overcompensating for gleesons comatose non-involvement in what feels like a total misfire come back zardoz all is forgiven<SEP>0
scarecrow is set in the small american town of emerald grove where high school student lester dwervick tim young is considered the local nerdy geek by teachers & fellow students alike the poor kid suffers daily humiliation bullying teasing & general esteem destroying abuse at the hands of his peers unfortunately he doesnt find much support at home since his mom is a slut & after lester annoys one of her blokes he chases him into a corn field & strangles the poor kid however something magical happens no the film doesnt suddenly become good lesters spirit gets transfered into the corn fields scarecrow which he then uses as a body to gain revenge on those who tormented him & made his life hellco-written co-produced & directed by emmanuel itier who according to the imdb credit list also has a role in the film as someone called mr duforq although i dont remember any character of this name i suppose anyone who ends up looking at the imdb pages for scarecrow will probably already be aware of its terrible reputation & i have to say it pretty much well deserved since its terrible the script by itier bill cunningham & jason white uses the often told story of one of lifes losers who gets picked upon & tormented for no good reason getting their revenge by supernatural means in a relatively straight forward teen slasher flick weve seen it all before weve seen killer scarecrows before weve seen faceless teens being killed off one-by-one before weve seen one of lifes losers get his revenge before weve seen wise cracking villains who make jokes as they kill before & weve seen incompetent small town sheriffs make matters even worse before the only real question to answer about scarecrow is whether its any fun to watch on a dumb teen slasher type level the answer is a resounding no to be honest the film has terrible characters awful dialogue an inconsistent & predictable story it has some cheesy one-liners like when the scarecrow kills someone with a shovel he asks can you dig it & the so-called twist ending which is geared towards leaving things open for a sequel is just lame the film moves along at a reasonable pace but it isnt that exciting & the kills are forgettable you know im still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed & killed with a stick of corndirector itier doesnt do a particularly good job here the kill scenes are poorly handled with no build up whatsoever which means theres never any tension as within two seconds of a character being introduced they are killed off also im not happy with the killer scarecrow dude doing all these back-flips & somersaults through the air in scenes which feel like they belong in the matrix 1999 or some japanese kung-fu flick! to give it some credit the actual scarecrow mask looks really good & he looks pretty cool but he is given little to do except spout bad one-liners & twirl around a bit dont you think that being tied to a wooden stake in the middle of a corn filed all day would have been boring i know hes a killer scarecrow but i still say he would have been bored just hanging around on a wooden stick all day! theres no nudity & the gore isnt anything to write home about theres a decapitation someones face is burnt someone is killed with a stick of corn someone gets a shovel stuck in their throat some sickles are stuck in peoples heads someone has their heart ripped out & someone has a metal thing stuck through the back of their head which comes out of their mouthwith a supposed budget of about $250000 this was apparently shot in 8 days well at least they didnt waste any time on unimportant things like story & character development technically this is pretty much point shoot & hope for the best stuff if you look at the guy on the floor who has just had his heart ripped out you can clearly see him still breathing the acting sucks the guy who played lesters mums bloke is wearing the most stupid looking wig & fake moustache ever because he played two roles in the film & the makers needed to disguise him but they just ended up making him look ridiculous & dont get me started on his accentscarecrow has a few fun moments & the actual scarecrow himself is a nice creation with good special make-up effects but as a whole the film is poorly made badly acted silly too predictable & very cheesy if you want to see a great killer scarecrow flick then check out scarecrows 1988 not to be confused with the gene hackman & al pacino film scarecrow 1973 or the upcoming horror flick scarecrow 2008 which is currently in production scarecrow proved popular enough on home video to spawn two more straight to video sequels scarecrow slayer 2003 & scarecrow gone wild 2004<SEP>0

i found this family film to be pleasant and enjoyable even though i am not a child it is based on the concept of a high school girl susan elisha cuthbert discovering that the elevator in her upper class apartment building becomes a time machine when a key on a key chain she got from a blind scientist is turned in the elevator lock she learns how to control the machine with some uncertainty about time of daythe film is not a work of serious science fiction you have to ignore the usual instability paradox associated with altering the past through time travel ie the past is changed to prevent the 1881 walker family from becoming poor but the change means the family never got into financial trouble so victoria wouldnt have told susan about the financial problems her mother had which means that susan shouldnt have had a reason to change the past in the first place! but other than that there are some nice touches in the story such as the old elevator panel found in the apartment of the woman who secretly invented and installed the time machine not having a space for the lock that activates the time machine feature as in many stories for children we need to also suppose that a child will not share startling information about a time travel device with a parent or other adult but instead hide the time travelerit also requires disregarding some poorly staged scenes and uninspired performances by some of the adult actors the child actors elisha cuthbert gabrielle boni and matthew harbour all were very convincing in their parts in one scene in the 1300s native americans notice susan observing and photographing them but they dont register surprise in the sudden appearance of this blond white skinned girl in peculiar dress their response is to simply stop what they are doing and to walk calmly towards susan in the same scene an indian mother is carrying what is supposed to be a baby but is so obviously a doll its white skinned and its head flops aroundtimothy busfield the award winning actor who originally came to fame in tvs old thirty something gives a somewhat uninteresting sometimes listless performance in the other extreme michel perron hams it up as the italian building superintendent janitor as does richard jutras in his role as a nosy neighbor the neighbors name is edward ormondroyd which is the name of the author of the novel the film is based on i suspect that these problems may be the fault either of the director or possible of a low budgetdespite these flaws i recommend the movie for kids in addition to the interesting story it also has some educational value in that it points out how much both technology and social norms have changed in little more that 100 years<SEP>1

i really enjoyed girl fight it something i could watch over and over again the acting was fantastic and i thought michelle rodriguez did a good job in the film very convincing might i say the movie is showing how women should stand up for what they want to do in life she had so much compassion and yet so much hate at the same time dealing with a ignorant dad didnt really help her much even though he loved her he was really hateful her mother died when she was younger and that also put some sadness in the role the love story was a part that i really enjoyed in the movie also i felt the passion the y had for one another then again drama sets in and then its like she is choosing between her boyfriend and her life long dream i thought it ended just right it was the kind of ending where you have to decide what happened in the future for themfor all you people who likes a movie based on a sport with a good plot i d suggest that you check this one out<SEP>1
ive just seen itfor those who dont know what it is i suggest to download the entire feature and enjoy viewing itits kinda amateur made trailer featuring the same producer of the famous short batman dead end but this time besides the black knight there is also superman it would be wonderful if they made the entire moviebut im afraid that its almost impossible especially just before the official batman 5 film-- there is no greater crime against peace than the refusal to fight for itlorenzo purifierpinto<SEP>1
this is an absolutely charming film one of my favourite romantic comedies its extremely humorous and the cast is wonderful though laurence olivier is mostly associated with his shakespearean work he shows in this film that he is by no means restricted to play only classical theatre he manages the transition from the cynical divorce solicitor who tries to avoid women and their traitorous ways to the lovesick puppy that falls for lady x played by merle oberon effortlessly the dialogue is wonderfully witty and refreshing and the atmosphere enchanting ralph richardson was a delight to watch as well i highly recommend it<SEP>1
all good movies inspire some direct to video copycat flick i was afraid that gladiator wasnt really that good a film because i hadnt seen any movie that had anything remotely resembling anything roman on the new releases shelf for months then i spotted full moons latest offering demonicus im a fan of full moons puppetmaster series and blood dolls but had never seen one of their non-killer puppet films anywaydemonicus chronicles what happens to a group of campers in the mountains of the alps one of the campers james finds a cave with old gladiator artifacts and feels impelled to remove a helmet from a corpse and try it on he becomes possessed and as the demonic gladiator tyrannus is impelled to kill his friends to revive the corpse who is the real tyrannusgranted like many full moon films this has little or no budget at times the editing and direction was so amateurish id swear i was watching the blair witch project the attempts at chopping off of limbs and heads reminds me of a monty python skit the weapons although apparently real look really plastic-y it literally looks like this was filmed by a group of friends with a digital camcorder on a weekend granted theres nothing wrong with such film-making just dont rent this expecting a technical masterpiece it looks like there were attempts at research for the script too because even though tyrannus really doesnt act much like a gladiator until the end at least he speaks latinall trashing aside i actually enjoyed this film not as much as a killer puppet film perhaps but full moon still delivers! the only thing that disappointed me was there was no full moon videozone at the end!<SEP>1
i bought this video at walmarts $1 bin i think i over-paid!!! in the 1940s bela lugosi made a long string of 3rd-rate movies for small studios in this case monogram--the ones who made most of the bowry boys films while the wretchedness of most of these films does not approach the level of awfulness his last films achieved ed wood classics such as bride of the monster and plan 9 from outer space they are nonetheless poor films and should be avoided by all but the most die-hard fansi am an old movie junkie so i gave this a try besides a few of these lesser films were actually pretty good--just not this onelugosi is what else a mad scientist who wants to keep his rather bizarre and violent wife alive through a serum he concocts from young brides they never really explained why it had to be brides or why it must be women or even what disease his wife had--so you can see that the plot was never really hashed out at allanyways a really annoying female reporter a lois lane type without jimmy olsen or superman wants to get to the bottom of all these apparent murders in which the bodies were stolen! so she follows some clues all the way to the doorstep of lugosi lugosis home is complete with his crazed wife a female assistant and two strange people who are apparently the assistants sons an ugly hunchbacked sex fiend and a dwarf naturally this plucky reporter faints repeatedly throughout the film--apparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand! eventually the maniacs all die--mostly due to their own hands and all is well at the conclusion the reporter and a doctor she just met decide to marry and naturally the reporters dumb cameraman faints when this occurs if you havent noticed theres a lot of fainting in this film or maybe because it was such a slow and ponderous film they just fell asleep!<SEP>0
to grasp where this 1976 version of a star is born is coming from consider this: its final number is sung by barbra streisand in a seven minute and forty second close-up followed by another two-and-half-minute freeze frame of ms streisand -- striking a christ-like pose -- behind the closing credits over ten uninterrupted minutes of barbras distinctive visage dead center filling the big screen with uncompromising ego that just might be some sort of cinematic recordor think about this: the plot of this musical revolves around a love affair between two musical superstars yet while streisands songs are performed in their entirety -- including the interminable finale -- her costar kris kristofferson isnt allowed to complete even one single song he performs nor though she does allow him to contribute a little back up to a couple of her ditties do they actually sing a duetor consider this: streisands name appears in the credits at least six times including taking credit for musical concepts and her wardrobe from her closet -- and she also allegedly wanted but failed to get co-directing credit as well one of her credits was as executive producer with a producer credit going to her then-boyfriend and former hairdresser jon peters as such streisand controlled the final cut of the film which explains why it is so obsessed with skewing the film in her direction what it doesnt explain is how come given every opportunity to make the great diva look good their efforts only make streisand look bad even though this was one of streisands greatest box office hits it is arguably her worst film and contains her worst performanceanyway moving the melodrama from hollywood to the world of sex-drugs-and-rocknroll streisand plays esther hoffman a pop singer on the road to stardom who shares the fast lane for a while with kristoffersons john norman howard a hard rocker heading for the off ramp to has-beenville in the previous incarnations of the story norman maine sacrifices his leading man career to help newcomer vicky lester achieve her success in the feminist seventies streisand & co want to make it clear that their heroine owes nothing to a man so the trajectory is skewed; shell succeed with or without him and he is pretty much near bottom from scene one; hes a burden she must endure in the name of love as such there is an obvious effort to make the leading lady not just tougher but almost ruthless while her paramour comes off as a henpecked twitkristofferson schleps through the film with a credible indifference to the material; making little attempt to give much of a performance and oddly it serves his aimless listless character well streisand on the other hand exhibits not one moment of honesty in her entire time on screen everything she does seems if not too rehearsed at least too controlled even her apparent ad libs seem awkwardly premeditated and her moments of supposed hysteria coldly mechanical the two have no chemistry making the central love affair totally unbelievable you might presume that his character sees in her a symbol of his fading youth and innocence though at age 34 streisand doesnt seem particularly young or naive the only conceivable attraction he might offer to her is that she can exploit him as a faster route to stardom and indeed had the film had the guts to actually play the material that way to make streisands character openly play an exploitive villain the film might have had a spark and maybe a reason to existbut i guess the filmmakers actually see esther as a sympathetic victim; they dont seem to be aware just how cold-blooded and self absorbed she is but sensitivity is not one of the films strong points: note the petty joke of giving barbra two african american back up singers just so the film can indulge in the lame racism of calling the trio the oreos and the film makes a big deal of pointing out that esther retains her ethnic identity by using her given name of hoffman yet the filmmakers have changed the characters name of the previous films from esther blodgett so that streisand wont be burdened with a name that is too jewish or too unattractive so much for ethnic pridethe backstage back stabbing and backbiting that proceeded the films release is near legendary so the fact that the film ended up looking so polished is remarkable nominal director frank pierson seems to have delivered the raw material for a good movie with considerable help from ace cinematographer robert surtees and the film did serve its purpose producing a soundtrack album of decent pop tunes including the oscar-winning evergreen by paul williams and streisand but overall the film turned out to be the one thing streisand reportedly claimed she didnt want it to be a vanity project<SEP>0
the saddest thing about this film is that only 8 people cared to leave a review of it and no-one felt it worthwhile leaving a comment on the message boardsmade the same year as philadelphiathe tom hanks oscar-winner this is the film that people really should have seen and given awards to there is more humanity life love tenderness and beauty in these two people than in just about any other gay film i have seen and it is all truein order for this to be printed i need to leave a few more lines of text: suffice it to say that anyone who really wants to know what it was like to be gay in the 60s and 70s and to understand just what aids was like before the modern drug cocktails allowed people to breathe a little easier this is the film to see oh and i will add a personal comment about aids despite everything there actually has been a silver lining to all the horror when aids first arrived it was called the gay cancer and governments preferred to let them die rather than spend a red cent on research to help save a bunch of fags then it became clear that aids would also be a heterosexual disease but the government wasnt ready for that; so when straight people began getting ill too the only organizations and associations that were available to them were those which had been set up by gays themselves examples: the names project: the quilt memorializing all those who died of aids; act up etc the result is that people who probably would never have come in contact with gays in their ordinary lives suddenly found themselves counting on them and needing them because no other organizations existed this close contact in my estimation is what finally broke down the barriers of prejudice and allowed the straight world to finally accept gays as equals when aids first came on the scene many of us thought that the straight world would use it as a way to come down even harder on us and that probably would have been true if straights didnt suddenly become ill too; nevertheless the strides that have been made in gay liberation - to the point that as i write this there are at least 5 countries in the world that accept gay marriage - these gains would probably have taken a lot longer without aids to bring us together it is sad to think that all those people - both straight and gay - had to die before our common humanity became more obvious - but if what i am writing here is true and i think it is - then there is a bit of comfort to be taken in realizing that all those people did not die in vain<SEP>1
the lion king series is easily the crowning achievement in disney animation the original lion king is the greatest masterpiece in cel animation lion king ii:simbas pride is the by far the best direct-to-video sequel that disney or any other studio has made for an animated feature it deserved a theatrical release the same can be said for this movie it has the original cast songs by elton john a hilarious story exciting action and touching character moments everything youve come to expect from this series not so much a new story but filler and extended background on timon and pumbaa and their place in this story what impressed me the most was the care taken in the animation all to often disney shorts on the animation quality of their video and television efforts but here they seamlessly blend new animation with footage from the original film the scenes never seem out of place nathan lane and ernie sabella are in full swing as timon and pumbaa matthew broderick robert guillame and moira kelly reprise their roles as simba rafiki and nala respectively we even get a return visit by whoopi goldberg and cheech marin as the hyenasthere are many big laughs in this movie so if you love lion king you need this movie the story is just not complete without it<SEP>1
for the first forty minutes empire really shapes itself up: it appears to be a strong confident and relatively unknown gangster flick at the time i didnt know why i thought it was good- but now i do one of the main problems with this film is that it is purely and utterly distasteful i dont mind films with psychos and things to prove a point- take jackie brown for example- but theyre all so terribly shallow in this but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment you literally feel a knot pull in your stomach another major problem is the protagonist he is smug arrogant yet- ironically enough- not that bad he doesnt seem tight enough to be a drug-dealing woman killer the fact is at the end of the day this film is completely pretentious not slick not clever just dull and meaningless- this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs * out of ***** 1 out of 5<SEP>0
i want to clarify a few things i am not familiar with ming-liang tsai movies and i am very familiar with art cinema; i grow up in the seventies times of goddard fellini bergman bertolucci and many othersart movies then were really art; like paints people did it to express their inner feelings not really worried about if other people understand anything they were beyond commercial values; just look some old antonioni or early picasso and you will understandtian bian yi duo yun the wayward cloud has nothing to do with that it is an opportunistic movie intended to fool festival judges and critics playing many things without saying anythingthe story makes no sense the lack of water makes the government to promote the use of watermelons to hydrate a girl in desperation steal water from the public bathrooms wc there is also a porno start neighbor trying to make a movie with an actress he does not seems to feel comfortable with there is some romantic awakening between the girl and the porno star the mess ends with a sexual scene not pornographic that many people feel shocked about but i believe it is less provocative than you can see in american pie or history of violencethe two main characters never talk sometimes a musical number 60 style appears and explains through a song what is happening in characters minds these video clips are really welcomed because the previous scene without dialog or music only people looking at each other takes sometimes 4 5 or even more minutes which in movie times is too much there is also a few bits about the difficult to make sex without love the selfish mind of the porno industry it is obvious this movie intended get away with it to fool festival juries and critics it have a few pseudo-shocking scenes within the limits of taiwan censorship and many subjects are open but nothing is concluded or goes anywhere these tricks got the movie a few disputed important prices in film festivals and get the movie an undeserved commercial success i see the movie in france and the theater was packed however please do not be fooled there is nothing new or original or even originally told or filmed in this movie it is boring and empty; really a fraud to public boogie nights which i did not really liked intimacy and 9 songs are far better movies<SEP>0
this man is nothing short of amazing you truly feel as if you have lived his life with him throughout these tragic events and cry along with his family in the end he was so passionate about his cause not just for himself but to ensure others who will survive him do not have to go through this wretched pain i watch this video every time i am having a bad or down day and it always manages to make me see the great and brighter side of life just like jonny did even with his unbearable pain my only regret is not knowing about jonny sooner as i visited england 2 times during his life and would have been able to say id met him it is comforting to know jonny is sitting on his cloud pain free! rest in peace dear jonny you deserve it!<SEP>1
the main problem with the documentary czech dream is that isnt really saying what it thinks its sayingin an audacious - i hesitate to use the word inspired - act of street theater vit klusak and filip remunda two student filmmakers from the czech republic pulled off a major corporate hoax to serve as the basis for their movie: they deliberately fabricated a phony hypermarket the eastern european equivalent of costco or wal mart super store built an entire ad campaign around it - replete with billboards radio and tv spots an official logo a catchy theme song and photos of fake merchandise - and then waited around to see just how many dopes would show up to their creation on opening day they even built a makeshift façade to convince people that the store itself actually existedone might well ask why do such a thing well thats a very good question but the answer the filmmakers provide isnt all that satisfying a one essentially were told that the purpose of the stunt was to show how easily people can be manipulated into believing something - even something thats not true - simply through the power of advertising and the movie makers run for moral cover by claiming that the real ie higher purpose for the charade is to convince the czech people not to fall for all the advertisements encouraging them to join the european union fair enough - especially when one considers that the actual advertisers who agree to go along with the stunt declaim against the unethical nature of lying to customers all the while justifying their collaboration in the deception by claiming it to be a form of research into what does and does not work in advertising in a way by allowing themselves to be caught on camera making these comments these ad men and women are as much dupes of the filmmakers as the poor unsuspecting people who are the primary target of the rusebut in many ways the satirical arrow not only does not hit its intended target it ironically zeroes right back around on the very filmmakers who launched it for it is they themselves and not the good-hearted and naturally trusting people who ultimately come off as the unethical and classless ones here as they proceed to make fools out of perfectly decent people some of them old and handicapped and forced to travel long distances on foot to get to the spot and what is all this supposed to prove anyway that people are greedy because they go to the opening of a new supermarket looking for bargains or that theyre stupid and gullible because they dont suspect that there might not be an actual market even though one has been advertised such vigilance would require a level of cynicism that would make it virtually impossible to function in the real worldno im afraid this smart-alecky nasty little stunt only proves what complete and utter jerks the filmmakers are for making some really nice people feel like idiots and indeed many of them when they finally discover the trick thats been played on them react with a graciousness and good humor im not sure i would be able to muster were i to find myself in their positionim not saying that the movie isnt gripping - something akin to witnessing a massive traffic accident in action - but when the dust has finally settled and all the disappointed customers return red-faced and empty-handed to their homes we can safely declare that they are not the ones who should be feeling ashamed<SEP>0
i am always so frustrated that the majority of science fiction movies are really intergalactic westerns or war dramas even star wars which is visually brilliant has one of its central images a futuristic gang that couldnt shoot straight imagine your coming upon about 600 people with conventional weapons most of them having an open shot and they missi have read much science fiction and wish there were more movies for the thinking person forbidden planet one of the earliest of the genre is still one of the very best the story is based on a long extinct civilization the krell who created machines which could boost the intelligence of any being by quantum leaps unfortunately what they hadnt bargained for is that the brain is a center for other thoughts than intellectual the primitive aspect of the brain the id as freud called it is allowed to go unchecked it is released in sleep a bad dream come to corporeal existence walter pigeon dr morbius is the one who has jacked his brain to this level and with it has built machines and defenses that keep him barely one step ahead of the horrors of the recesses of his own mind his thoughts are creating horrors that he soon will not be able to defend the krell a much superior species could not stop it; it destroyed them the landing party has never been of great interest to me the rest of the actors are pretty interchangeable ann francis is beautiful and naive and certainly would have produced quite a reaction in the fifties adolescent male her fathers ire is exacerbated by her innocence and the wolfy fifties astronauts for they are more like construction workers on the make than real astronauts they are always trying to figure out dames the cook is a great character with his obsession for hooch robbie the robot has much more personality than most of the crew and one wonders if mr spock may not be a soulmate to the literal thinking of this artificial creature the whole movie is very satisfying because the situation is the star morbius cant turn back and so he is destined to destroy himself and everything with him there are few science fiction films that are worth seeing more than once; this is one that can coast right into the 21st century<SEP>1
i just got through watching this dvd at home we love westerns so my husband rented it he started apologizing to me half way through the saddles costumes accents--everything was off the part that made me so mad is where the guy didnt shoot the collector with his bow and arrow as he was taking the fat guys soul his only excuse was he only had 2 arrows left we watched it all the way through and as someone else saidtoo many bad things to single out any one reason why it sucked i mean the fact that the boy happened to snatch the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found whats the point of that and why were there a grave yard where everyone died on april 25 but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still up walking around if you want a movie to make fun of after a few beers this may be your movie however if you want a real western you will hate this movie<SEP>0
this is by far one of my favorite of the american pie spin offs mainly because in most of the others the main character one of the young stiflers always seems unrealistic in nature for example ap: the naked mile you have a teenage guy surrounded by naked college chicks and has one in particular hot on his trail to rid him of his virginity problem and he ends up stopping mid-deed and rides a horse back to sleep with his girlfriend who keep in mind gave him a guilt free pass for the weekend i can appreciate the romantic aspect of the whole thing but lets be realistic; most people who are watching these movies arent particularly searching for a romantic storywhereas the most recent installment finally seems to realize who the audience is and good old erik stifler seems to wake up and smell the roses and as always mr levenstein lends his perfectly natural eyebrow humor to the equation and scored a touchdown with this new movie<SEP>1
although the actors were good specially fritzi haberland as the blind lilly the film script is obsessively pretentious and completely arbitrary a famous theatre director hilmir snær guðnason becoming blind after a car accident is on the run for himself and his destiny lilly being sightless since her birth is teacher for blind persons and wants to make him seeing again blind persons are seeing with their fingers nose and ears here this movie is becoming a roadmovie; and the longer the road becomes the closer their relation develops which was predictable since the beginning of the film the theatre director is on the road to his mother jenny gröllmann his mother is living somewhere in russia on the sea and making artistic installations - of course what should she do other! - and she is still living because she is waiting his son to die my god! this are destinies!finally the son arrived! mum is celebrating a big party! at the beach wind is blowing and a pianist is playing on a real piano in the middle of a dune yes they are celebrating her farewell the son arrives just in time mother can finally swallow the pills administered by a pretty nurse now a great artist can die in the arms of her great artist son speaking sad contemplations about live in perfect german while the son is answering with a rough accent because the son is unable to see he is not falling in love to the nurse - the film script would have become also too complicate! - but is looking for lilly on the way back to homeparallel to this roadmovie the sister of lilly staying at home is asking a gawky schoolmate to deflower her who has first to booze himself to courage the occasion is favourable because mum tina engel is on journey together with the lover of lilly paul harald schrott they are after lilly to bring her back paul and the mother of lilly are not falling in love because the film script would have become too complicate the film script missed to make out of paul something exceptional too i would suggest an architect or a pianist or course a famous one! when they finally find lilly they want to convince her to come back to paul because he has two eyes to see and is able to care for her but lilly felt in love to his pupil the theatre director; did i mention that he was even a famous theatre directorthis is german film art! as you may see in this pretentious production that the german film subsidy fund is not always producing good films because they subsidy just such kind of pseudo intellectual films this film is really embarrassing i have the impression that the film script has been cobbled together from some highbrows in coffee shops and restaurants everybody is entitled to contribute with an idea probably also til schweiger has contributed with some intellectual flash of wit being a co-producer i was reminded by this film script to an other german film of absolute painfulness: barfuss - already the spelling of the title is not right! barfuss dvd cover writes proudly: a til schweiger film this film got also subsidies of filmstiftung nrw filmförderung hamburg and the ffaplease dont spoil your time with this film! there are really good films in germany watch out for film directors like marcus h rosenmüller joseph vilsmaier hans steinbichler hans-christian schmid faith akin<SEP>0
this self-indulgent mess may have put the kibosh on mr branaghs career as an adapter of shakespeare for the cinema released 4 years ago; not a peep of an adaptation since i just finished watching this on cable -- holy god its terriblei agree with the sentiment of a reviewer below who said that reviewing something so obviously and sadly awful is an ungenerous act that comes across as shrill that being said ill take the risk if only because *loves labours lost* is the perfect reward for those who overrated mr branaghs directorial abilities in the past branagh has always been a pretty lousy director: grindingly literal-minded; star-struck; unforgivably ungenerous to his fellow actors he loves his american stars but loves himself more making damn sure that he gets all the good linesalong those lines the sad fact remains that *loves labours lost* is scarcely worse than the interminable ghastly bloated *hamlet* from 1996 in fact this film may be preferable if only because its about 13 the length branagh decided it would be a good idea to update this bad early work of shakespeares to the milieu of cole porter george gershwin fred astaire yada yada so he sets the thing in 1939 leaves about an eighth of the text intact in favor of egregious interpretations of thirties standards wait till you see the actors heaved up on wires toward the ceiling during im in heaven and casts actors not known for their dancing or singing himself included the result is a disaster so surreal that one is left dumbfounded that they just didnt call a horrified stop to the whole thing after looking at the first dailies i dont even blame the cast to paraphrase hamlet the screenplays the thing! no one could possibly come off well in this hodge-podge: the illustrious rsc alumni fare no better than alicia silverstone who could possibly act in this thingbranaghs first mistake was in thinking that *loves labours lost* was a play worth filming trust me it isnt its an anomaly in the bards canon written expressly for an educated coterie of courtiers -- not the usual audience for which he wrote hence theres a lot of precious and tedious! word-play references to contemporary scholastic nonsense parodies of lylys *euphues* in other words hardly the sort of material to appeal to a broad audience hell it doesnt appeal to an audience already predisposed to shakespearean comedy the play cannot be staged without drastically cutting the text and desperately updating it with any gimmick that comes to hand which begs the question why botherbranaghs second mistake was in thinking that shakespeares cream-pie of a play could be served with a side-order of gershwins marmalade clearly the idea or hope was to make an unintelligible elizabethan exercise palatable for modern audiences by administering nostalgic american pop culture down their throats at the same time but again this begs the question why bother<SEP>0
the finale of the weissmuller tarzan movies is a rather weak one there are a few things that derail this filmfirst tarzan spends much of the film wearing floppy sandals in my opinion any footwear on tarzan whether it be sandals or boots as sometimes portrayed takes away from the character which is supposed to be anti-civilization and pro-junglesecond the character of benji as mentioned in a previous post totally derails the movie as the comic foil to me his character is unnecessary to the films plotalso while weissmuller still cuts a commanding figure as tarzan its apparent that he was not in his best shape although in his later jungle jim movies his physique had improved somewhat from this filmthe octopus battle is a terrific idea but i think it should have been done in an earlier weissmuller film when he was at his physical peak likewise the battle which takes only 30 seconds tops would be much more thrilling if it was drawn out to 90 seconds to 2 minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in tarzan and his mateand while brenda joyce as jane and linda christian as mara are overwhelmingly pleasing to the eye it doesnt manage to salvage this last weissmuller film - a disappointing ending to a great character run<SEP>0
in this sequel bruce is still called billy lo get it bruce= billy lo= lee no but apart from that thats all it has in common with the other movie billy doesnt seem to be an actor anymore he seems to be in another country hes more like a spy hes the only cast member to return and sadly they kill him off to make way for a new character his brother bobby sadly when bruce dies the movie pretty much dies with him this was extremely poorly made it seemed like they were writing the script as they were filming the footage works for a while its not too obvious at first but soon bruce is always shown in the dark all the time he kicks out a light at one stage for no other apparent reason to hide the fact that its not bruce playing the part sadly when he dies the movie changes i cant help but wonder if they were filming as they were writing and may well have planned to keep bruce alive but later decided to kill him off because it would not have been plausible as bobby does not appear until billy is dead its hard to change the lead character halfway in the movie and bruce is a hard act to follow so its hard to now accept bobby as the star bruce is never seen again in this movie i think they should have made this sequel without bruce he has a lame role in this movie people hoping to see a new bruce lee movie will be disappointed to see that although hes given the top billing he only has a featuring role even the worst movies have at least one memorable bit if there was one bit about this movie people seem to talk about its the scene where billy fights in a plant nursery ironically it doesnt even use bruce lee footage mind you they did it more convincingly in no retreat no surrender not one of the other actors here ever made anything else memorable bruces girlfriend colleen camp is never mentioned my advice is to turn it off as soon as bruce is finished writing his letter to his brother nothing else in the movie is worth watching i found it really sad to see bruce die i dont see how a small budgeted movie like this could get enough money to use footage from enter the dragon this was a cheap way of trying to cash in on bruces name oddly this and the original are credited in bruces filmography thankfully so far no one has tried anything like this again 1981 was the year of bruces last movie appearance it was a sad way to end it but thankfully this is proof that bruces movie career should be left alone<SEP>0
and the oscar for the most under-rated classic horror actor goes to - dwight frye seriously his name should be stated with the same awe as karloff lugosi and price and this movie proves it his character herman was one of the 2 reasons i can give to watch this movie dwight gave this somewhat more than slightly disturbed misfit a lovable yet creepy demeanor that led you hoping for a larger role the entire moviethe other reason is the comic relief of m eburne being in the medical profession myself i have to give kudos to the expert performance of a self-pity prone hypochondriac though other medical mistakes did give a brief chuckle especially when the good doctor samples his fellow physicians medication well continue giving it to her unfortunately these 2 outstanding performances could not keep me awake through 3 attempts of sitting through this unbearably slow movie the plot is predictable with only few minor twists the filming while pulling off a legitimate spooky atmosphere was more productive at making me yawn - yes you can use too much shadowmy recommendation - watch this once to see frye and eburne - but only when wide awake and with lots of caffeine<SEP>0
one may ask why the characters snarl yell and chew the scenery without any perceptible reason except someone wanted to make a movie in barcelona billie baldwin is that the right one is forgettable in the copestranged-husbandloving-father-of-cute-little-blond-girl role the story seems to have been cut and pasted from the scenes thrown away from adventure films in the last three years ellen pompeos lack of charisma is a black hole that seems to suck the energy out of every scene she is in her true acting range is displayed when she takes her blouse off as the movies careens from one limp chase scene to another unfortunately the directing rarely goes bad enough to be camp or a parody it is all just cliché familiar in every respect the director cast his own daughter as the precocious brat probably because no respectable agent would have permitted a client to ruin a career by being in such a lame contrived and uninteresting movie the only heist here is the theft of the investors money and the viewers time<SEP>0
i love ghost stories in general but i particularly love chilly atmospheric and elegantly creepy british period-style ghost stories this one qualifies on all counts a naive young lawyer solicitor in britspeak is sent to a small village near the seaside to settle an elderly deceased womans estate its the 1920s a time when many middle-class brits go to the seaside on vacation for their health well guess what theres nothing healthy about the village of crythin gifford the creepy site of the elderly womans hulking brooding victorian estate which is located on the fringes of a fog-swathed salt marsh when the lawyer saves the life of a small girl none of the locals will help the endangered tot -- you find out why later on in the film he inadvertently incurs the wrath of a malevolent spirit the woman in black she is no filmy gauzy wraith but a solid black silhouette of malice and evil the viewer only sees her a few times but you feel her malevolent presence in every frame as the camera creeps up on the lawyer while hes reading through legal papers you expect to see the woman in black at any moment when the lawyer goes out to the generator shed to turn on the electricity for the creepy old house the camera snakes in on him and you think shell pop up there too waiting for the woman in black to show up is nail-bitingly suspenseful weve seen many elements of this story beforethe locked room that no one enters the fog the naive outsider who ignores the locals warnings but the director somehow manages to combine them all into a completely new-seeming and compelling ghost story watch it with a buddy so you can have someone warm to grab onto while waiting for the woman in black<SEP>1
this was a great movie! even though there was only about 15 people including myself there it was great! my friend and i laughed a lot my mom even enjoyed it there was two middle aged women there and a mid 20 year old there and they seemed to enjoy it i love the part where corky and ned are like both liking nancy and stuff its cute lol and when she gets her roadster and ned is there yeah this was a great movie even thought people underestimated it lol go see it i bet youll enjoy it!! i really enjoyed it and so did my friend people were so tough on this movie and they hadnt even seen it i bet next time they will give the movie and actresses a chance they all did a great job in my opinion but if you have young kids its still appropriate i will probably take my 7 year old niece to watch it too<SEP>1
i wont give anything away by describing the plot of this film other than to say that it begins with the return to israel of a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide it unfolds like a detective story as the blind woman tries to figure out why her friend ended her life as she pursues her investigation and the information accumulates it leads inexorably to a devastating conclusion the film is expertly paced and the acting especially by talia sharon as yaara the blind woman is excellent israeli film has definitely come of age and is now fully competitive with other foreign films though few have found a large audience in the us<SEP>1

i wished id taped men in white so i could watch it again what you mean you really enjoyed it theo no i mean i could watch it again to see if it was as retarded stupid and as embarrassingly unfunny as i can remember it a lot of people have claimed it was made for children may i suggest it was also made by children because the whole structure of the script lacks any type of discipline on the part of the producers and writers and much of set pieces seem to have been included because it seemed like a good idea at the time the cast dont help but i genuinely started to feel sorry for them honestly you can believe that during filming the cast had to lie to their families that they were filming a hard core porn film such was their embarrassment at having to appear in something as dismal as this to give you an idea of how bad the acting is every time baywatch babe donna dericco disappeared from the narrative i waited patiently for her to reappear then seconds later i forgot she was in the movie got that a star from baywatch appears and seconds later you forget theyre in the movie this tells you all you need to know about the standard of men in white fair enough its trying to be a live action cartoon similar to the goodies although the dismals would be a better adjective for this movie though perhaps the movie deserves some credit for never descending to toilet humour but considering this is a kids movie this didnt stop itv broadcasting it at 11 pm then there should be no near the knuckle humour in it anyway<SEP>0
this is exactly the sort of saturday matinee serial i loved during world war ii i was under ten years of age and thats the audience this serial is designed for looking at it now one must roar at its ineptitude and stupidity the budget must have been next to nothing given the shortcuts and repeats the acting well this is republic pictures 1944 they read the linesand no doubt had one take to make them convincingone and half stars<SEP>0
i saw shiner on dvd while i was watching it i thought this is a really bad porn flick without the porn i also thought whoever wrote this has some real issues then i watched the directorwriter carlson explain his process as a special feature yeah it was real specialthe emphasis of the film is placed on two alcoholic losers who hit each other to get off they are marginally attractive there is frontal and full nudity these factors probably account for the film being seen at allthe most upsetting element of the film is the gay bashing and the subsequent further gay bashing of the same victim who tries ineptly to exact revenge from his assailants the two drunken losers not only is the subject handled absurdly and badly from a technical point of view but the acting is horrendously badthen theres the boxer-stalker theme this is really insane not just absurd this hunky boxer is somehow traumatized by the persistent attentions of a fleshy mommas boy who works at his gyms parking lot this is in la mind you the boxer is so traumatized that he turns up at the stalkers house strips in front of him and gets excited in the processwell all i can say is why would a boxer who is at heart an exhibitionist be so traumatized by the attention of a stalker it simply makes no sense and im afraid some psycho-dynamics actually do make sense if you take the time to read about them however bad scripts seldom make sense at allthe directorwriter seems to have thought that this film represents a considerable minority within the gay community well he may be correct i suppose we may never know since that minority would be so dysfunctional they would hardly be able to get organized enough to ever get to an obscure gay film festival or dvd store the only two places they could possibly find this turkey thank goodness for that<SEP>0
`the united states of kiss my asshouse of games is the directional debut from playwright david mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller it stars lindsay crouse as best-selling psychiatrist margaret ford who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide in doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels `downtown to visit the lowlife place house of gamesthe gambler mike played excellently by joe mantegna turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty he offers crouses character a deal if she is willing to sit with him at a game a big money game in the backroom hell cancel the patients debts the card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work gaining the trust of others and a fascinating relationship begins what makes house of games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control is it the psychiatrist or the con-man or is it the well-known man of great bluffs david mametin house of games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring however in every david mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings not the direction in house of games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads showy and distracting but mainly as is the case with much of mamets work it is the dialogue which grips you and slowly draws you into the film no one in the house of games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words everyone bluffs and double bluffs which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order this is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension house of games can also be viewed as a `class-war division movie with lindsay crouse we have the middle-class well-to-do educated psychiatrist and joe mantegna is the complete opposite the working class of america earning a living by `honest crimethe film seduces the viewer much like crouse is seduced by mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of american cinema and the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for its stunningan extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings 910<SEP>1
this is said to be a personal film for peter bogdonavitch he based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters who are detectives these detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective doesnt it this entire movie was written by peter and it shows how out of touch with real people he was youre supposed to write what you know and he did that indeed and leaves the audience bored and confused and jealous for that matter this is a curio for people who want to see dorothy stratten who was murdered right after filming but patti hanson who would in real life marry keith richards was also a model like stratten but is a lot better and has a more ample part in fact strattens part seemed forced; added she doesnt have a lot to do with the story which is pretty convoluted to begin with all in all every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with unless youre millionaire from manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call for the rest of us its an irritating snore fest thats what happens when youre out of touch you entertain your few friends with inside jokes and bore all the rest<SEP>0
this is a very bland and inert production of one of shakespeares most vibrant plays i can only guess that the intent was to make the play as accessible and understandable as possible to an audience that has not been exposed to shakespeare before by doing this though - by making every line clear and every intent obvious - they have drained the play of life and turned it into a flat caricature somehow it is actually boring - a very hard feat given such wonderful materialthe acting is forgettable at best - sam waterston as benedick and douglas watson as don pedro others however do not fare so well april shawnhams hero is a pouty breathless airhead that frequently provokes winces jerry mayers don john is a nonsensical cartoon character on the level of snidely whiplash though snidley was much more enjoyablef murray abraham you know the guy who killed mozart is not in this version unless he was in disguise and had his name removed from the creditsgiven that the producer joseph papp is basically a theater god this production is not only disappointing but head-scratching as welldont bother with this watch branaghs much ado instead - his version is overflowing with vitality and humor to say nothing of wonderful performances<SEP>0
this was one of the dvds i recently bought in a set of six called frenchfilm to brush up our french before our planned holiday in beautiful provence this year so far as well as improving our french we have considerably enhanced our appreciation of french cinemawhat a breath of fresh air to the stale predictable unimaginative crash bang wallop drivel being churned out by hollywood what a good example for screenplay writers actors directors and cinematographers to follow it was so stimulating also to see two identifiable characters in the lead roles without them having to be glossy magazine cover figures the other thing i liked about this film was the slow character and plot build up which kept you guessing as to how it was all going to end is there any real good in this selfish thug who continually treats his seemingly naïve benefactor with the type of contempt that an ex-con would display will our sexually frustrated poor little half deaf heroine prove herself to the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has bestowed upon her the viewer is intrigued by these questions and the actors unravel the answers slowly and convincingly as they face events that challenge and shape their feeling towards each otheronce you have seen this film like me you may want to see it again i still have to work out the directors psychological motive for the sub plot in the role of the parole officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth a second look the plot does ask for a little imagination when our hero is given a chance to assist our misused and overworked heroine in the office you must also be broad minded to believe in her brilliant lip reading and how some of the action falls into place but if you go along for the thrilling ride with this example of french cinema at its best you will come out more than satisfied four stars out of five for me<SEP>1
a few weeks ago the german broadcaster sat1 advertised this movie as the tv-event of the year - sorry but ive seen better things on tv this yeari didnt thought much of the movie but i soon reminisced about two other horrible movies when i watched the commercial - namely titanic and pearl harbor because the picture looked so familiar: the heroine if i can really call her that in the middle and her two loved-ones next to her - pearl harbor anyone in fact the love-story is a poor mans version of the one in pearl harbor and that one was already poor!but as i like watching movies and analyzing their patterns i eventually decided to watch that rubbish the movie begins with a doctor leaving his family for the military strike against russia near the end of the third reich promising his wife that he will return now fast forward to spring 1948: germany lost the war and the allies & russia captured the country and they both try to eliminate each other for world power and their ideologies: capitalism versus communism well i guess you already know the story because you have to know it - the movie doesnt really bother with it so much and literally takes a dump on historical facts the movie tries to depict the us government as angels and completely ignores the contribution of other countries during the airlift especially great britain who was responsible for nearly a quarter of the rations despite having their country bombed from a country that theyre trying to helpwhat was also pretty annoying were the historical remarks the people said in the movie like when the heroines mother tells her daughter that germany might be parted in two with a response like: thats impossible! or when stalin where the director thought we just stick similarly looking mustache on the actor and he will look like him says that russia has to stop coca cola from spreading in germany yeah right if stalin has ever said something like this or there is this one us pilot who tells his fellow of a bread with meat and everything possible in it - please! burgers were invented way before that timein the movie you once see a map showing the airlines funnily enough the map looks like it came straight out of a laser printer - in 48 the us general lucius clay whos main idea was to stay in berlin is portrayed as a guy who is mean and grumpy and all the ideas he historically had like for example the airlift and improving on that idea came from the fictive character phillip turner the love interest of the main actress which leads me to other aspects: not enough african-american soldiers in the movie there were like two in the whole film! also relationships between us soldiers and german civilians was not allowed and by a revealing of such a relationship the us soldier wouldve been sent home i dont want to say that there were no relationships at all but in this movie there was a couple that almost got married if it wasnt for the death of the pilot in his fake cgi plane which looked terribly unrealistic especially the cgi fire!if it wasnt enough all americans in this movie spoke accent-free german although they only were in germany for a couple of months - look im also american living in germany for my whole life and even i have a little accent notably bad was also the child acting - the kids had like two expressions on their faces: normal-i-look-monotonous-like-a-robot and grinningall in all the movie was boring from beginning to end moving way too slow especially the love story which was the same as the one in pearl harbor just with half of the dialogue the sad part is that the movie was very successful - 897 millions watched the first part and 783 millions the second part the day after thus sat1 receiving two consecutive wins in the overall market share and a whopping win in the commercial relevant group but like i always think: the biggest pile of bull-crap is where the most flies go to<SEP>0
despite a tight narrative johnnie tos election feels at times like it was once a longer picture with many characters and plot strands abandoned or ultimately unresolved some of these are dealt with in the truly excellent and far superior sequel election 2: harmony is a virtue but its still a dependably enthralling thriller about a contested triad election that bypasses the usual shootouts and explosions though not the violence in favour of constantly shifting alliances that can turn in the time it takes to make a phone call its also a film where the most ruthless character isnt always the most threatening one as the chilling ending makes only too clear: one can imagine a lifetime of psychological counselling being necessary for all the trauma that one inflicts on one unfortunate bystandersimon yam all too often a variable actor but always at his best under tos direction has possibly never been better in the lead not least because tony leungs much more extrovert performance makes his stillness more the powerful<SEP>1
this is a very entertaining flick considering the budget and its length the storyline is hardly ever touched on in the movie world so it also brought a sense of novelty the acting was great pz to dom and the cinematography was also very well done i recommend this movie for anyone whos into thrillers it will not disappoint you!<SEP>1
the only reason i saw this movie was for jimmy fallon who ive had a crush on since 9th grade which was his first year on snl i am a die-hard yankees fan and i didnt find the movie painful until the last 15 minutes when they begin showing clips of the alcs games i had to cover my ears and make small noises so i wouldnt have to hear that which must not be heard but otherwise it was completely bearablei thought jimmy played the role very well because the character was supposed to be nervous and quirky and he is a nervous and quirky guy i know that it may not be a academy award-winning stretch but the movie is just a light fun romantic comedy that is actually appropriate for both women and men to seejimmy and drew worked well together and they had much better chemistry on camera than other actors in the past ed burns and angelina jolie in that stupid movie what i think jimmy has a positive career ahead of him and thank goodness because taxi could have killed it i think fever pitch will help him out a lot everyone needs to stop being so critical of his acting ability because he is just starting out in movies i imagine it must be difficult and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time tom hanks russell crowe etc youll see that they started off in some flops busom buddies australian soap operas heres wishing jimmy a successful career on screen i never wanted him to leave snl but what can you do<SEP>1
i have looked forward to seeing this since i first saw it listed in her work finally found it yesterday 21302 on lifetime movie channeljim larsons comments about it being a sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths were dead on writers probably shouldnt get a bonus everyone else sro for making the movieanybody who appreciates a romantic movie should see itnatashas screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric to say nothing of her beauty that anything she is in goes on my favorite list her tv and print interviews that i have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking forgod bless her her family and future endeavorsthis movie doesnt seem to available in dvd or video yet but i would be the first to buy it and i think others would too<SEP>1
notable because of its notorious explicit scene when the gorgeous maruschka detmers takes her young lovers penis from his trousers and into her mouth even without this moment the film is a splendid if slightly disturbing passionate and blindingly sexy ride detmers puts in a great performance as the partly deranged insatiable delight wandering about her flat nude dressed partly dressed and naked she steals most of the film about love sexual passion philosophy and politics for me the last two get a little lost and the ending is most confusing when her fiancé is released whilst fellow terrorists are released she seems uncertain as to who she wants and the young lover seems more interested in his exams than anything else as she weeps beautifully of course!<SEP>1
this movie was rented by a friend her choice is normally good i read the cover first and was expecting a good movie although itwas a horror movie which i dont prefer but no horror came to mind while watching the movie it was a dullnot very entertaining movie the appearance of denise richardswas again a pleasure for the eye but thats it we the four of uswere a little bit disappointed but feel free to see this movie andjudge it yourself<SEP>0
madison is not too bad-if you like simplistic non-offensive family-friendly fare and more importantly if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydroplane racing if like me you grew up with the sport and your heroes had names like musson muncey cantrell slovak etc prepare to be disappointedprofessional film critics have commented at length on the formulaic nature of the film and its penchant for utilizing every hackneyed sports cliché in the book i neednt repeat what theyve said what i felt was sadly missing was any sense of the real excitement of unlimited hydro racing in the glory years which many would argue were already past in 1971yes it was wonderful to see the old classic boats roaring down the course six abreast though it was clear that the restored versions hats off to the volunteers at the hydroplane and race boat museum were being nursed through the scenes at reduced speed but where was the sound much of the thrill of the old hydros was the mind-numbing roar of six allison or rolls-merlin aircraft engines wound up to rpms never imagined by their designers hitting the starting line right in front of you you didnt hear it you felt it real hydro buffs know exactly what im talking about theres none of that in madison instead every racing scene is buried under what is supposed to be a heroic musical scoreand then there are the close-up shots of the drivers riding smoothly and comfortably in the cockpits as if they were relaxing in the latest luxury limousines in some cases taking time to smile evilly as they contemplate how best to thwart the poor home-town hero or in one particularly ridiculous shot taking time to spot jake lloyd giving a rocky salute from a bridge pier in reality some unlimited drivers wore flak vests to minimize the beating they took as the boats slammed across the rock-hard water at speeds above 150 mphas one reviewer so aptly put it the sport deserves better than thisfinally since another user brought up anachronisms ill add one: the establishing shot of seattle shows the kingdome and safeco field neither existed in 1971<SEP>0
loved part one the impossible planet but whoops what a disappointment part two the satan pit is the cliffhanger of something apparently rising out of the pit was - nothing coming out of the pit then ages spent crawling round air vents to pad out the story the beast a roaring thing empty of intelligence so no doctorvillain confrontation id been anticipating the tardis is somehow inside the pit despite the pit not being open till long after the tardis fell through the planet crust and finally another ready made solution which existed for no logical reason - i mean why not plunge the beast into the hole as soon as the pit opened why not plunge him in all those years ago instead of imprisoning him anyway why not - i could go on but ive lost interest<SEP>0
is there a movement more intolerant and more judgmental than the environmentalist movement to a budding young socialist joining the circus must seem as intimidating as joining a real circus even though such people normally outsource their brain to hollywood for these important issues the teachings of hollywood can often seem fragmented and confusing fortunately ed is here to teach neo-hippies in the art of envirojudgementalismhere youll learn the art of wagging your finger in the face of anyone without losing your trademark smirk youll learn how to shrug off logic and science with powerful arguments of fear youll learn how to stop any human activity that does not interest you by labeling it as the gateway to planetary armageddonin addition to learning how to lie with a straight face youll also learn how to shrug off accusations that are deflected your way no matter how much of a hypocrite you are youll be able to use as much energy as al gore yet while having people treat you as if you were amishin the second season was even more useful as we were able to visit other hollywood gods holy be thy names and audit - ie judge - their lifestyles note: this is the only time its appropriate for an envirofascist to judge another because it allows the victim the chance to buy up all sorts of expensive and trendy eco-toys so that they can wag their finger in other peoples faceswhat does ed have in store for us in season three maybe hell teach us how to be judgmental while sleeping!<SEP>0
i feel like ive been had the con is on dont fall for it after reading glowing reviews the director was a film reviewer with sky for years so must have a lot of mates in the press ready to do him a favour by writing favorable reviews i expected solid acting atmosphere suspense strong characterization an intriguing plot development and poetic moments sadly sixteen years of alcohol doesnt deliver on the critics promises for the most part sacrifices these qualities in lieu of cheesy low budget special effects what was that clichéd cobweb scene in there for unrealistic fight choreography and mindless mind numbing narration cliché edits and camera anglessixteen years of alcohol starts off interestingly with some beautiful location shots in scotland but its straight downhill from here unfortunately instead of spending some time building atmosphere creating characters we might care about or building suspense - the director opts to begin driving you crazy with self indulgent heavy handed twaddle voice-overs the lead characters are so unsympathetic and are so badly acted - the audience doesnt care what happens to them desperate actors do desperate thingslike this movie! to make matters worse the homages typical of a director trying to pay his dues to past masters are either utterly cliché or unconvincing the soundtrack is the only thing that lifted me and kept me in the cinema but even that failed to support the dramatic narrative other connecting a period of time to the actionfor some reason the movie got increasingly flawed and to be quite honest annoying i still watched the whole damn thing!i guess i liked the attempt at gritty realism in the film but even that was destroyed when they were often inter-cut with weird and abstract sometimes pointless scenes you dont need a huge budget to make truly moving film so much has been said about how little money they had to make this film half a million is not a little bit of moneyso no excuses! sometimes i wonder what the actorsor their agents were thinking!pass on this turkey unless youre masochistic or mindless anywaynot my thing1510<SEP>0
i thought this movie seemed like a case study in how not to make a movie for the most part since i am a filmmaker i give it a 2 for consistencythe problems remain from beginning to end with the plot being extremely predictable using bits and pieces of most if not all previous successful war stories the computer generated graphics were too much like viewing a video game at points and there seemed to be no attempt by the director to add some realistic quality to the story i was interested in the budget to get an idea of what he had to work with but did not find that informationit seemed like this project pushed the limits of a low budget movie too far resulting in a production that drags the viewer along with the story without their imagination being engaged the actors werent bad but the plot needs more innovation<SEP>0
one of the best love stories i have ever seen it is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion but lovely nonetheless big edie and little edie seem a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly and are infinitely quotable: its a goddamned beautiful day now will you just shut up the opening explanation of little edies costume only promises that the movie will live on forever and so will big edie the world famous singer and little edie the world famous dancer<SEP>1
who would have thought that such an obscure little film could be so haunting and touching i am really impressed its a shame that more people have not seen it i loved as always hans zimmers score and what a directorial debut by bernard rose! yet i wonder if i should call this a horror film it could easily be argued that it is a fantasy or a drama as well well regardless i love the interpretive potential it has everything and everyone in annas played by charlotte burkedreams represents a real conflict in her lifethe house itself the tree mark the lighthouse etc it is the many details such as these that make the film so good for repeated viewings i hope i come across another little movie as loaded with emotion and psychological meaning as this one some time soon<SEP>1
this film does a superb job of depicting the plight of an als lou gehrigs diseasesufferer the subject is done with compassion as well as humor helena bonham carter is so convincing as a person with als that i found it hard to believe that she was only acting kenneth branagh a superb actor lives up to expectations as the quirky artist who misbehaves and is forced to provide companionship to helenas character as part of his community service an alternative to prison time watching the development of the relationship between these two is a treat from beginning to end tha fact that it is a fairy tale does not detract from the fabulous performances one comes to care deeply for the two of them<SEP>1
can any movie become more naive than this you cant believe a piece of this script and its ssooooo predictable that you can tell the plot and the ending from the first 10 minutes the leading actress seems like she wants to be barbie but she doesnt make it the doll has more acting skillsthe easiness that the character passes and remains in a a music school makes the phantom of the opera novel seem like a historical biography i wont even comment on the shallowness of the characters but the one good thing of the film is madsens performance which manages to bring life to a melo-like one-dimensional characterthe movie is so cheesy that it sticks to your teeth i can think some 13 year old britney-obsessed girls shouting o do give us a break! if we want fairy tales there is always the brothers grimm book hidden somewhere in the attic i gave it 2 instead of one only for virginia madsen<SEP>0
i saw this movie when i was really little it is by far one of the strangest movies i have ever seen now normally i like weird movies but this was just a bit too muchtheres not much of a plot to the movie if anything it starts out like toy story where toys come to life and raggedy ann and andy go on an adventure to rescue their new friend babette from there craziness ensues theres the greedy the looneys a sea monster named gazooks and a bunch of pirates singing show tunes all of which just made the movie weirder also i cant help but feel that babette is annoying and a bit too whiny she definitely didnt help the movienow even though i didnt like this movie there were a few cute parts i liked the camels song even though it was a song about being lonely it had a friendly feel to it then there was sir leonard while most of the looneys were just plain nuts sir leonard was the most interesting and probably the funniest king koo koo was just a little dirtbag that made dr evil look like a serious villain also there was raggedy andys song no girls toy it was definitely good song for little boys who wanted to act tough but honestly even these things didnt make the movie any better but remember this is just my perspective while i personally wouldnt recommend this movie even i have to admit it does have its charming moments see it if youre interested but only if youre in the mood for something really out of the ordinary<SEP>0
an update of the skits and jokes you would have seen on a burlesque stage in the first half of the 20th century its a string of several jokes acted out some of them you could tell your grandmother some of them not but its a fairly safe bet shes heard them all before for what it tries to be its not too bad before you rent it remember that its an older style of entertainment and has more value as history than as comedy or titillation robin williams has a couple of bits but hes interchangeable with the other players<SEP>0
for his first ever debut this film has some riveting and chilling moments in the best horror film fashion the pit of your stomach tightens every moment during this film the ending is superb the makers of blaire witch obviously watched this film its ending wasnt an end but a beginning of the end a great movie and only a piece of japans great as far as scare factor a perfect score it makes you think and scared out of your mind<SEP>1
this is without a doubt the worst most idiotic horrible piece o crap i have ever watchedthis movies plot is that some guy goes crazy and dresses up as santa claus and kills people because he saw his mother give his father oral sex while he was dressed as santa clause that is why he went insane is it just me or is that the worst damn reason for someone to go insane like ever and thats not the only thing im being serious when i say nothing happens in this damn movie nothing until like 1 hour and 15 minutes of it have gone bytheres an entire friggin scene where he glues a friggin santa beard on to him its a friggin minute long who the hell wants to see that however i must say the ending of this movie made me crap myself laughing at it so if you see this movie on tv or something come back in like 1 hour and 20 minutes just to watch without a doubt the worst ending in all of cinematic history and im serious about thatits not even so good its bad its tedious its idiotic it made me want to break the vcr its just not worth your time also im sure every other review mentioned this but the actress who played the mother on home improvement was in this movie for a split second you want to know how bad this movie is id rather watch home improvement for sixty six hours then even look at this movies cover ever again<SEP>0
this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time all of you who regard this movie as absolute sh*t obviusly are not intelligent enough to grasp all of the subtle humor that this movie has to offer it shows us that real life and ficticious action can produce a winning combination also as a romantic comedy it has one of the most clever ways for two people to find each other name me another movie where you can see all of that as well as donald sutherland singing a song like theyre going to find your anus on a mountain on mars<SEP>1
i have seen over 1000 movies and this one stands out as one of the worst movies that i have ever seen it is a shame that they had to associate this garbage to the angels 1963 song my boyfriends back if you have to make a choice between watching this movie and painful dental work i would suggest the dental work<SEP>0
the screen writing is so dumb it pains me to have wasted 2 hours of my life ill never get back where have i heard this before the acting is so-so things change often enough to keep you watching and waiting for something gruesome to happen nevertheless there isnt a single original thing in this movie while the first cube was a nerdy horror movie which didnt make a whole lot of sense in the end cube zero has picked up on that and tries to retell exactly the same story except this time it makes an obnoxious point of trying to spoon-feed explanations for every detail that the first movie didnt answer the comic thing is the director recycles the exact scenes of the first movie that were somewhat weird and tries to explain them but the scenes are just copied over there is no coherence whatsoever this script is sooo pointless i can imagine it being written by some half-wit 15 year old with a baseball cap and a pack of beer for a class project the best part is in the end they cripple the good wunderkind guy and he becomes the retarded fellow in the first movie and you see him when they find him this room is green in cube 1997 goodie gooodie clap clap what a twist first of all what about if you havent seen the first one this doesnt make any sense you nitwit director oh another great idea: instead of the numbers to identify xyz coordinates of the room cube 1997 this time it is 3 letters each one giving one of 26 possible coordinate values duh except now permutations dont make much sense anymoreso he lets the letters disappear before anybody can use themi want my money backi guess i had to write this down since there are just so many bad inconsistent or just stupid ideas in this movie directorswriters should be required to possess some talent<SEP>0
i cannot say enough bad things about this train wreck it is one of the few movies ive ever been tempted to walk out of it was a bad premise to begin with first pregnant male but then they tried to make it a spoof what were they spoofing all those real pregnant males this was the worst movie i have ever seen if it had enough votes it would be on the imdb bottom 100 if it was possible to give it a zero i would and i would still feel i had given it too much credit<SEP>0
when i ordered this from blockbusters website i had no idea that it would be as terrible as it was who knows maybe id forgotten to take my add meds that day i do know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station wagon donned in their late 70s-style wide collars bell-bottoms and feathered hair i knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era was glory bound for the dumpsterthe first foretelling of just how bad things were to be was the narration at the beginning trying to explain what cosmic forces were at play to wreak havoc upon the universe forcing polyester and porno-quality music on the would-be viewer from the opening scene with the poorly-done effects to the monsters from another world and then the house which jumps from universe to universe was as achingly painful as watching an elementary school production of the vagina monologuesthroughout the film the sure sign something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear the ship was comprised suspiciously of what looked like old vcr and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path of course if moved slower than bob barkers impacted bowels but it had menacing pencil-thin armatures and the ability to cast a ominous green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through mere balsa wood in an hour or two with some assistancemoving on as the weirdness and bell bottoms continue we found out that theyre caught in a space time warp how do we garner this little nugget of scientific information because the oldest male lead tells his son that in a more or less off-the-cuff fashion like reminiscing about how you won the big game over a cup of joe or an ice-cold bottle of refreshing coca-cola was pops a scientist nope but he knew about horses and has apparently meddled as an amateur in string theory and einsteins theoriesthe recording i watched on dvd was almost bootleg quality the sound was muddy and the transfer looked like it had been shot off a theater screen with the video recorder on a cell phone other than that it was really really really bad theres not enough reallys to describe it reallyi know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classics i never saw this film on its original release but even back then i think i wouldve come to the same conclusion: bury this one quick<SEP>0
a stupid rich guy circa about 1800 wants to visit a nearby mental asylum to see how a famous doctor cares for his patients despite an initially hostile response he is soon cordially invited in and given a tour by the good doctor and as the doctor shows him about he talks and talks and talks!!! and as he talks loonies run amok here and there doing nothing especially productive while there is some action here and there and some of it quite disturbing its amazing how dull and cerebral the whole thing is--lacking life and energy which is odd for a horror flick even a guy who thinks hes a chicken and dresses like one becomes rather tiresome the further this tour takes the guest the more disturbing it becomes until ultimately you realize that the inmates have taken over the hospital and are torturing their keepers yet again despite this twist the film is amazingly lifeless in many places--particularly when it moves very slowly as a bizarre ceremony is taking place or people are just wandering about the set only when the workers from the asylum found in a prison cell starving does the film have any real impact considering this plot it sure is hard to imagine making it boring but the people who made this cheap exploitational film have! now with the same plot and competent writing acting and direction this could have been an interesting and worthwhile filmyou know now that i think about it this was the plot of one of the episodes of the original star trek tv show! you know the one with lord garth--master of the universe and kirk and spock are held prisoner by this madman and his crazed followersa final note: the film has quite a bit of nudity here and there and includes a rape scene so be forewarned--its not for kids in fact considering how worthless the film is it isnt for anyone! however with the version included in the 50 movie pack--chilling classics the print is so incredibly bad that its hard to see all this flesh due to the print being so very dark<SEP>0
felt it was very balanced in showing what jehovahs witnesses have done in protecting american freedoms it also showed the strong faith of two families who were first generation witnesses i also appreciated how it showed how by becoming a jehovahs witness affects non-witness family members and how hard it is for them to accept the fact that they dont celebrate holidays the sad part is that non-witness families do not think of having their witness family over for family dinnersvisits or give them gifts at any other times but for holidays or birthdays when it comes to medical care the witnesses want and expect a high standard of medical care what people forget is that blood transfusions allow for sloppy medical care and surgeries whereas bloodless treatments causes the medical team to be highly skilled and trained which would you prefer to treat your loved ones i highly recommend this video!<SEP>1
i had high hopes for troy and i am so bitterly disappointed the film was directed so badly it made my stomach ache the pacing was so slow the dialogue laughable and the film - well apart from a nice fight scene between achilles pitt and hector bana - the rest was shallowand why oh why does hollywood always insist on rewriting stories to fit consumer approval agamemnon didnt die in troy the war lasted 10 years and achilles was killed by paris outside the walls of troy with an arrow to the ankle! it annoys me that such a classic story as this is turned into a soapand dont even start me on the lack of chemistry between helen and paris she was the woman the war was fought over and it didnt even look as if the two of them cared a great deal about the other no sparks no emotion no hopei have to say in the films defence brad pitt eric bana and peter o toole acted very well with a bad script but that isnt enough to save this awful movie can anybody tell me where the £200 million budget went maybe in all the trees they used for the funeral pyres - where did they get all those treesi am so disappointed it hurts<SEP>0
this movie is a remake of two movies that were a lot better the last one heaven can wait was great i suggest you see that one this one is not so great the last third of the movie is not so bad and chris rock starts to show some of the comic fun that got him to where he is today however i dont know what happened to the first two parts of this movie it plays like some really bad b movie where people sound like they are in some bad tv sit-com the situations are forced and it is like they are just trying to get the story over so they can start the real movie it all seems real fake and the editing is just bad i dont know how they could release this movie like that anyway the last part isnt to bad so wait for the video and see it then<SEP>1
my girlfriend and i were stunned by how bad this film was after 15 minutes we would have called it quits except we were too curious to see if the film could possibly redeem itself it didnti cant understand the praise given to this film the writing was downright awful and delivered by some of the worst acting i have seen in a very long timeone thing that especially annoyed me about this film was that often when people were talking to each other there was an unnatural pause between lines i understand using a pause to create a feeling of awkwardness like in happiness this was not that type of pause -- it was just simply bad directing this film might actually be much better with subtitles and maybe the overseas market is the best one for this film because then the innane dialogue and bad acting wouldnt be noticed as muchi generally like these types of small quirky films the real blonde walking and talking lovely and amazing but this one failed on so many levels that i consider it one of the very worst films i have sat through in the last few years<SEP>0
having heard so many people raving about this film i thought id give it a go apart from being incredibly slow which i dont mind as long as the wait is worth it but it just isnt as many others have said there are so many inconsistencies and so much of this film just doesnt ring true the reaction of the 4 men switches from shock horror on finding the body to complete indifference whilst they fish surely if they were the type of men that would go on happily fishing then they would have just reported the body and said they had only discovered it after their fishing tripwhy on earth tie the body to a tree go fishing and then tell everyone you found the body 2 days previously its so hard to watch a film knowing that the behaviour of the main characters is so inconsistent as for the rest of the townsfolk well youd think at least one of them might show some curiosity about who actually killed the woman! the body itself naked except for the knickerswhat scenario leads to that if she was raped then why still the knickers if she was raped with the clothes on then why remove them afterwards bar the knickers if she wasnt raped then why take all her clothes off bar the knickersleaving yourself with evidence to dispose of i truly cant think of any realistic scenario that would lead to that other than killing someone to steal their clothes so you can fill up your jumble sale stall! oh well its watchable but only just and only because despite the poor script the acting is strong<SEP>0
strange yet emotionally disturbing chiller about fed up middle-aged man william h macy who finally decides to leave the family business murder for hire run by his quietly over-demanding father donald sutherland while seeing a shrink john ritter and flirting with another patient neve campbelltalk about a major dilemma but panic is a top-notch thriller that looks like american beauty meets the professional macy and sutherland are the stand-outs here remarkable debut for first-time writerdirector henry bromell im surprised that this movie didnt get a chance to stay in theaters for more than a couple of weeks<SEP>1

like ishtar and king of comedy other great misunderstood comedies envy has great performances by two actors playing essentially losers may be too harsh a word i will call them suburban under-achieversthis film was a dark comedy gem and im not sure what people expect i relish seeing a major studio comedy that isnt filled with obvious humor and i believe that the small moments in this movie make it worthwhile the look on stillers face when he sees the dog doo disappear for the first time captures a moment a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves yes it was a fairly simple story but it examined the root of envy in a really interesting way there were a lot of great scenes the j-mans decrepit cabin by the lake corkys unceremonious burial weitzs wife role and walkens j-man -- all great stuffi cant stand people that get on imdb and mercilessly trash films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one i will take envy over almost any of the top ten grossing comedies of the year save napoleon dynamite its wittier wackier and an offbeat enjoyable gemremember this people; most times popular doesnt equal good<SEP>1
the shirley jackson novel the haunting of hill house is an atmospheric tale of terror which conveys supernatural phenomena in an old mansion the atmosphere is well set out and the chills are staged well a haunting masterpiecethe 1963 chiller the haunting stays closely to the book but also adds its own details to the plot fortunately these are very few and so the terror of the book and the chills are executed even better on the screen the black and white photography only adds to the creepiness of the movie excellent! and then jan de bont made this in 1999 the remake of the haunting hit the cinemas - if you could call this a remake why they had to make a remake of the 1963 movie is a mystery in itself but for the moment lets look at the film itselfit starts off averagely as most horror movies do the set used for hill house is beautiful and oddly mysterious and for a few minutes it seems as if the film is actually going to be quite a fair re-telling and then the first scare comes: a loose harpsichord wire slashes a womans face dr marrows assistant this is hilarious and truth be told it nearly had me in tearsfrom then on the film just spirals downwards the acting seems to become somewhat wooden as the film goes on with owen wilsons character being particularly irritating so its such a relief when hes decapitated by the fluethe special effects practically make this movie which is a shame because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very dated examples of these are many so i wont bother listing themso all in all i along with hundreds of others strongly recommend that you watch the original chiller or as an alternative buy the novel by shirley jackson but please stay away from this and if you do decide to watch this watch it on the tv as a lot of the channels love to screen this film and not the original or rent it cheap but please dont buy it whatever you do dont waste your money!final rating: 410<SEP>0
pushing daisies is just a lovely fairy tale with shades of amelies aesthetic and romance its got a beautiful palette its shots well thought out and detailed its names and dialogue whimsical and too cutesy to be real its imagination great and its romance deepwatch the blue in the sky pop out at you as blue cant be found in the rest of the sets or shots with few exceptionswatch a weirdly natural and totally satisfying song break out of a sceneits score is gorgeous its cast is supremely likable theres great music and the two leading romantic stars cant touch each other or shell die how much more sexual tension do you need actually i had wished they found a way around this one but cest la vieit is simply a show that it is a pleasure to spend an hour with and i recommend it highly there hasnt been other television quite like it and i would like to see more it got me through a flu one crappy week as it makes for good companybring it back!<SEP>1
this movie has some things that are pretty amazing first it is supposed to be based on a true story that in itself is amazing that multiple tornadoes would hit the same town at night in the fall-in nebraska i wonder if the real towns name was close to blainsworth which is the towns name in the movie there is an ainsworth nebraska but there is also a town that starts with blains-somethingit does show the slowest moving tornadoes on record in the the seen where the boys are in the house on the other hand the scene where the tv goes fuzzy is based in fact before doppler radar and weather radio we were taught that if you turned your tv to a particular channel not on cable and tuned the brightness just right you could tell if there was a tornado coming the problem was that by then you would be able to hear it since i know something about midwest tornadoes it made this movie fun for me i enjoy it more than twister i mean give me a break-there is no way you could make it through and f5 by chaining yourself to a pipe in a well house<SEP>1
odd slasher movie from producer charles band in the days of full moons greatest success band said that he would never make real killer films because he felt that little puppets and big monsters added a fantasy element that made the films better - people killing each other is thus real and less fun a nice philosophy and a true shame that band having destroyed the full moon studio through possible shoddy business dealings became so desperate for home cinema profits that he started making exactly what the likes of blockbuster wanted and therefore sacrificed creativity and originality the team behind this one also worked on delta delta die! and birth rite - both equally bland by full moon standards debbie rochon is on usual top form here as a newbie to a gang of dudes and dudettes who decide to make up a story about a murder club she - as one would obviously - does all she can to join and then panic sets in because it was not a true story and silly ms rochon believed it and now everybody will have to run around getting covered in blood and maybe killing each other or maybe not the choice is theres and with regard to this movie its yoursnot recommended but not entirely bad either<SEP>0
the perfectly stupid weapon i think the guys dancing at the beginning of one of steven segals movies was intented to mock jeff doing his forms to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie the plot is predictable the fights were fair and jeff acts about as well as the sofa he beats with some sort of weapon in one scene<SEP>0
presque rien come undone is an earlier work by the inordinately gifted writer director sébastien lifshitz with the collaboration of writer stéphane bouquet - the team that gave us the later wild side as we come to understand lifshitzs manner of storytelling each of his works becomes more treasureable by allowing his tender and sensitive love stories to unfold in the same random fashion found in the minds of confused and insecure youths - time now time passed time reflective time imagined time alone - lifshitz makes his tales more personal involving the viewer with every aspect of the characters responses it takes a bit of work to key into his method but going with his technique draws us deeply into the filmmathieu handsome and gifted jérémie elkaïm is visiting the seaside for a holiday a time to allow his mother dominique reymond to struggle with her undefined illness cared for by the worldly and wise annick marie matheron and accompanied by his sister sarah laetitia legrix: their distant father has remained at home for business reasons weaving in and out of the first moments of the film are images of mathieu alone looking depressed riding trains speaking to someone in a little recorder we are left to wonder whether the unfolding action is all memory or contemporary actionwhile sunning at the beach mathieu notices a handsome youth his age starring at him and we can feel mathieus emotions quivering with confusion the youth cédric stéphane rideau follows mathieu and his sister home continuing the mystery of attraction soon cédric approaches mathieu and a gentle introduction leads to a kiss that begins a passionate love obsession mathieu is terrified of the direction he is taking rebuffs cédrics public approaches but continues to seek him out for consignations the two young men are fully in the throes of being in love and the enactment of the physical aspect of this relationship so very necessary to understanding this story is shared with the audience in some very erotic and sensual scenes yet as the summer wears on mathieu a committed student realizes that cédric is a drifter working in a condiment stand at a carnival it becomes apparent that cédric is the dionysian partner while mathieu is the apollonian one: in a telling time in architectural ruin mathieu is excited by the beauty of the history and space while cédric is only interested in the place as a new hideaway for lovemakingmathieu is a complex person coping with his familial ties strained by critical illness and a non-present father a fear of his burgeoning sexuality and his nascent passion for cédric their moments of joy are disrupted by cédrics admission of infidelity and mathieus inability to cope with that issue and eventually they part ways time passes family changes are made and mathieu drifts into depression including a suicide attempt the manner in which mathieu copes with all of these challenges and finds solace strangely enough in one of cédrics past lovers pierre nils ohlund brings the film to an ambiguous yet wholly successful climaxafter viewing the film the feeling of identification with these characters is so strong that the desire to start the film from the beginning now with the knowledge of the complete story is powerful lifshitz has given us a film of meditation with passion conflicts with passions powers found in love and a quiet film of silences and reveries that are incomparably beautiful the entire cast is superb and the direction is gentle and provocative lifshitz is most assuredly one of the bright lights of film-making in french with english subtitles highly recommended grady harp<SEP>1

excellent film dealing with the life of an old man as he looks back over the years starting around 1910 he reminisces about his boy and young adulthood; his family friends romances etc very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet finaleall things in life come together as one and a river runs through it and that river haunts me worth seeing<SEP>1

this happens to be one of my favorite horror films its a rich classy production boasting an excellent cast of ensemble actors beautiful on-location cinematography a haunting musical score an intelligent and novel plot theme and an atmosphere of dread and menace its reminiscent of such classic films as rosemarys baby and the shining wherein young vulnerable women find themselves victimized by supernatural forces in old creepy buildings with a macabre past here cristina raines plays a top new york city fashion model named alison parker her happy outgoing exterior masks a deeply conflicted and troubled soul this is evidenced by the revelation that in her past she attempted suicide twice- once as a teenage girl after walking in on her degenerate father cavorting in bed with two women and having him rip a silver crucifix from her neck and toss it on the floor and the second time after her married lawyer-boyfriends wife supposedly committed suicide over learning of their affair telling her beauplayed by a suitably slimy chris sarandon that she needs to live on her own for a year or so she answers a newspaper ad for a fully-furnished spacious one-bedroom apartment in an old brooklyn heights brownstone this building actually exists and is located at 10 montague terrace right by the brooklyn heights promenade off remsen street the producers actually filmed inside the building and its apartments paying the residents for their inconvenience of course the real estate agent a miss loganava gardner seems to be very interested in having alison take the apartment- an interest that cannot be solely explained by the 6% commission she would earn especially when she quickly drops the rental price from $50000 a month to $40000 alison agrees and upon leaving the building with miss logan notices an elderly man sitting and apparently staring at her from the top-floor window miss logan identifies the man to her as father halliran and tells alison that hes blind alisons response is very logical- blind then what does he look at after moving in alison meets some of the other residents in the building including a lesbian couple played by sylvia miles and beverly dangelo who provide alison with an uncomfortable welcome to the building alisons mental health and physical well-being soon start to deteriorate and she is plagued by splitting headaches and fainting spells when she relays her concerns to miss logan about her sleep being disturbed on a nightly basis by clanging metal and loud footsteps coming from the apartment directly over her she is dumbstruck to learn that apart from the blind priest and now herself no one has lived in that building for the last three years summoning the courage one night to confront her nocturnal tormentor she arms herself with a butcher knife and a flashlight and enters the apartment upstairs she is confronted by the cancer-riddled specter of her dead father and uses the knife on him in self-defense when he comes after her the police investigate and find no sign of violence in that apartment- no corpse no blood nothing yet alison fled the building and collapsed in the street covered in blood- her own as it turns out but theres nary a mark on her what alison doesnt realize until the films denouement is that her being in that brownstone has a purpose she was put there for a reason- a reason whose origin dates back to the biblical story of the garden of eden and of the angel uriel who was posted at its entrance to guard it from the devil she is being unknowingly primed and prepped by the catholic church to assume a most important role- one that will guarantee that her soul which is damned for her two suicide attempts can be saved at the same time the invisible neighbors who turn out to be more than just quirky oddballs have a different agenda in mind for her this is a competent and intelligently done film and one that surprisingly portrays the church and its representatives in a mostly sympathetic light<SEP>1

i really thought they did an *excellent* job there was nothing wrong with it at all i dont know how the first commenter could have said it was terrible it moved me to tears i guess it moved about everyone to tears but i try not to cry in a movie because its embarrassing but this one got me it was sooo good! i hope they release it on dvd because i will definitely buy a copy! i feel like it renewed my faith and gave me a hope that i cant explain it made me want to strive to be a better person they went through so much and we kind of take that for granted i guess compared to that i feel like our own trials are nothing well not nothing but they hardly match what they had to go through i loved it who played emma!<SEP>1

after watching this film i was left with a two very annoyances about this film: why did they make chens character this mcguyver hit-man and lees character such an incompetent idiot chens characters background is that he was raised in an underground cambodian orphanage for blood thirsty fighter where they learn to brawl it out to the death like wild dogs this detail is pushed early on during a scene where he gets into a cab and as it starts to drive he shows how he is unfamiliar with a seat belt soon after this scene he has a similar situation at a dim sum restaurant not only is he uneducated he is starving this is not a reference to chens scrawny physique but to the two early scenes in the film where he is scarfing down food one of which being rice porridge off the floor of the lower deck on an old ship si in the first ten minutes of the film it is established that chen is malnutrition-ed unmodernizedand has only thing going for him his dog brawling fighting style of some sort despite this situation chen manages to out-shoot every policeman even managing to ricochet a bullet off a metal pipe to hit a guy in a head whom was holding chens girlfriend hostage and has somehow attained a super human strength swings a 50 lb block of concrete plastered on the end of a metal pipe to the head of the police chief as he is getting shot in the chest by said chiefnow lees characterokay i get it hes depressed hes got some baggage but wow can he do anything right one moment they try to make him cool composed and ready to take care of business and the next moment he just got beat again first scene he runs into chen and he manages to misses him from approx 15 ft multiple times toward the end of that scene lee watches chen as his close friend and coworker gets slowly stabbed in the neck with a long knife for a good full 5 seconds while holding a gun to chen face at a 10 ft distance even at the end of the movie lee manages to get stabbed to death and fails once againand my biggest problem with this movie is that it is presented in a manner that film makers are trying to get the audience to sympathize with chens character and that he is just killing to survive that would be a lot easier if i didnt just watch chen kill innocent people throughout the whole awful movie of the numerous people he killed only two people had the intention of trying to kill him the police chief and lee others were just people who were eating boat owners taxi drivers and policemen trying to arrest him not kill overall chens character is a just a cold blooded killer who kills for what he wants even if its just a free ride did i mention he is carrying a wad of hundred dollar bills throughout most of the film my 3 stars go to some of the interesting directorcamera work who got in some nice shotsbottomline: one made for the nut-hugging chen fans for me dog bite this dvd<SEP>0
on the surface the idea of omen 4 was good its nice to see that the devil child could be a girl in fact sometimes as in the exorcist when girls are possessed or are devilry its very effective but in omen 4 it stunkdelia does not make me think that she could be a devil child rather she is a child with issues issues that maybe only a therapist rather then a priest could help she does not look scary or devilish rather she looks sulky and moodythis film had potential and if it was made by the same people who had made the previous three films it could of worked but its rather insulting really to make a sequel to one of the most favoured horror trilogies as a made for tv movie specialon so many levels it lets down its cheap looking the acting is hammish and the effects are typical of a tv drama the characters do not bring any sympathy and you do not route for them i recently re-watched it after someone brought it for me for christmas and it has dated appallingif your thinking of watching this then i would suggest that you dont watch one of the others or watch the exorcist or watch the good son just dont waste your time on this drivel!<SEP>0
for anyone who liked the series this movie will be something to watch however it also leaves you wanting more i loved the way that every character detectivemade an appearance least with the ending of who is the fourth chair for they leave a reason for another movie my guess is bayless of course this like the series was a very well put together series of scenes this is a series i wish had lived on thanks to the cast for some wonderful tv<SEP>1
first things first this movie is achingly beautiful a someone who works on 3d cg films as a lightercompositor the visuals blew me away every second i was stunned by what was on screen as for the story well its okay its not going to set the world on fire but if you like your futuristic blade runner-esquire tales and who doesnt then you will be finei do have to say that i felt the voice acting was particularly bland and detracted from the movie as a whole i saw it at the cinema in english but i am hoping that there is a french version floating around somewheredefinitely worth seeing<SEP>1
steve carell comes into his own in his first starring role in the 40 year old virgin having only had supporting roles in such films as bewitched bruce almighty anchorman and his work on the daily show we had only gotten a small taste of the comedy that carell truly makes his own you can tell that will ferrell influenced his comedic air but carell takes it to another level everything he does is innocent lovable and hilarious i would not hesitate to say that steve carell is one of the next great comedians of our timethe 40 year old virgin is two hours of non-stop laughs or 4 hours if you see it twice like i did a perfect supporting cast and great leads charm the audience through the entire movie the script was perfect with so many great lines that you will want to see the movie again just to try to remember them all the music fit the tone of the movie great and you can tell the director knew what he was doingfilled with sex jokes some nudity and a lot of language this movie isnt for everyone but if you liked the wedding crashers anchorman or any movie along those lines you will absolutely love the 40 year old virgin<SEP>1

as a convert into the church of jesus christ of latter day saints i try to absorb as much as i can of my new religions history i was invited to attend a showing of this film with my sons & the other young men & women as well as their families of our ward on a beautiful spring evening we drove to kirtland ohio to the churchs historical village located there we were to have had reservations at the vistors center to view this movie since my movie viewing was limited to only a few church documentaries i was intrigued the only full length motion pictures of the churchs i had seen was legacy and my best two years both which i thought were very well written and preformedat the beginning the missionary interpretor passed out tissues stating that several people had been deeply moved to the point of tears by this movie i thought okbut it takes a lot to move me to tears imagine my surprise when i found myself sobbing! it truly is a very moving & inspirational testament to the prophet joseph smithsee it & believe in its powerful message!<SEP>1
when a film has no fewer than five different titles it usually means several things and almost always means that the film has major flaws somewhere necromancy has major flaws and is just out and out bad i saw the version on video called rosemarys disciples yes i am sure it differs from other versions but i am not inclined to think that in any way is any other version and the few more minutes it might have - going to be really any better the story is perhaps the biggest problem: the film opens with laurie waking up and her husband taking her to a town where he has a new job at a toy factory for occultistsyep it gets bad this early! the town is called lillith and has some guy with a rifle on the bridge to make sure only those selected by the owner of the town are allowed in soon we find that everyone living in lillith is a witch and all follow the directives of mr cato - the head of this municipal coven who wants his dead son backhence the name necromancy the people in the town do witch kind of stuff - have ceremonies some like wearing a goats head and promiscuity aboundsnot much really shown in this area but none of these people are very good actors mr cato is played robustly by the figuratively and literally larger-than-life movie maverick orson welles welles is misused but make no mistake he is the best thing in this movie and that is really the saddest part of necromancy as welles gives a pretty poor and pedestrian performance with little directorial guidance in one scene at a party director bert i gordon keeps going back to welles watching the action of the party using the exact same frames! it looked ridiculous as did the scene that was repeatedly seen over and over again of a womans arm centered in swirling flames after a car crash it looked like the arm of a shop mannequin the story is never fully utilized as we never really know what happens: many scenes are shot like dreams or hallucinations and never confirmed this also applies to the corny hokey ending the lead pamela franklin is pert and pretty and has some talent other than her performance real slim pickings from the rest of the cast sans welles the direction and story were both done by gordon who obviously had little gas left in the engine this is not a good movie in any way under any name<SEP>0
i dug this out and watched it tonight i honestly think it must be 20 years since the last time i saw it i remember it being a seriously flawed film i dont remember it being this bad!!!!!i am absolutely aghast that a project with this much potential should have been mistreated so reprehensibly who am i to blame for this the 2 guys who wrote and i use that word loosely the script the casting directors who so terribly miscast at least 3 major characters in the story only 2 of them are among the amazing 5 the director who clearly refused to take it seriously and kept shoving awful music on top of bad writing & bad acting everywhere i liked the theme song-- but it should never have been used all the way throughout the entire film! don black who should be ashamed at some of the lyrics he wrote for that musicit figures that i should pull this out less than a week after re-reading the comic-book adaptation the first 15-20 minutes of the film more-or-less really less parallel the first issue of the comic as i watched it tonight i kept wondering-- why was almost every single detail changed doc showing up then using his wrist-watch remote-control to open the safe and the snipers bullet missing him by 5 inches because the refractive glass were just about the only things left the same i mean if youre gonna do an adaptation why in gods name change everythingonce they leave docs hq virtually nothing is as it was in the comic which given roy thomas i figure probably follows the book i read somewhere they actually combined elements of 2 different novels into one movie again-- why ive heard it was changed because they werent able to secure the kind of budget they wanted i look at the film and think lack of money in no way explains what i saw on the screen!!you know when people complain about joel schumacher they should really take a look at this thing the best thing i can say is i think it would make a great double-feature with the 1966 batman feature-- and probably a great triple-bill with that and the 1980 flash gordon all 3 films are silly maybe we can blame the 1966 film and tv series for this some fans have complained over the years that adam wests batman ruined the image of comic-books in the minds of generations of non-comics fans i think the same could be said for hollywood im reminded of how many really really bad films based on classic characters have been made over the years especially it seems to me in the late 70s & early 80s charlie chan fu manchu tarzan buck rogers flash gordon the lone ranger-- all murdered by hollywood types who think oh comic-books! so you know its supposed to be stupid! more like theyre the stupid ones what a waste of potentiallet me say some good things despite the script and the directing ron ely is great when i read a doc savage story i dont think of the james bama paintings i think of ely bill lucking who later was a regular on the a-team is terrific eldon quick who ive seen somewhere else but cant recall where is terrific paul gleason-- who i absolutely hated with a passion and a vengeance in the breakfast club teachers like the one he played should be banned from ever teaching anywhere may be the best of the amazing 5 in the film pamela hensley-- though her part was almost unrecognizable from the original story-- is terrific before she let her hair down i also realized she looked a hell of a lot like ardala valmar from those awful john calkins buck rogers strips i just read the other day shes got a big nose like ardala-- only not quite as pronounced the comics ardala actually looked more like the 1936 movie princess aura-- or cher or maybe streisand take yer pick ardala actually got plastic surgery in the george tuska strips-- after she was stunning!paul wexler funny enough i saw just last week in a get smart episode i wonder if he was anything like the character he was supposed to be playing i dont know because that character sure wasnt in the movie the film takes its title from<SEP>0
frankly this movie has gone over the heads of most of its detractorsthe opposite of perdition being lost is salvation being saved and this movie is one of a very few to deal with those two concepts the movie also explores the love and disappointments that attend the father-son relationship it should be noted at the outset that none of these are currently fashionable themesthe premise is that the fathers in the move hit-man michael sullivan tom hanks and his crime boss john rooney paul newman love their sons and will do anything to protect them but rooneys son connor is even more evil than the rest he kills one of rooneys loyal soldiers to cover up his own stealing from his father when connor learns that sullivans son michael witnessed it he mistakenly kills sullivans other son and sullivans wife in an attempt to silence witnessessullivan decides he wants revenge at any price even at the terribly high price of perdition rooney who in one scene curses the day connor was born refuses to give up his son connor to sullivan and hires a contract killer named maguire jude law to kill sullivan and his son so rooney joins his son connor on the road to perditionfor the rest of the movie accompanied by his surviving son young michael sullivan pursues connor rooney down the road to perdition and maguire pursues sullivan when sullivan confronts rooney in a church basement and demands that he give up connor because connor murdered his family rooney says - michael there are only murderers in this room and theres only one guarantee none of us will see heaven as the movie ends somewhat predictably one character is saved and one character repentsim not a big tom hanks fan but he does step out of character to play hit-man sullivan convincingly giving a subtle and laconic performance newman does well as the old irish gangster rooney showing a hard edge in his face and manner his eyes haunted by connors misdeeds jude law plays maguire in a suitably creepy way tyler hoechlin plays young michael naturally and without affectationthe cinematography constantly played light off from darkness echoing the themes of salvation and perdition the camera drew from a palette of greens and greys the greys belonged to the fathers and the urban landscapes of depression era illinois the greens belonged to the younger sons and that states rural flatlands thomas newmans lush sonorous and haunting music had faint irish overtones and was played out in copland-like arrangements the sets were authentic mid-western urban - factories churches the homes shone with gleaming woodworkthe excellence of the movie lies in its generation of a unique feeling out of its profound themes distinctive acting and enveloping music and cinematography the only negative was a slight anti-gun message slipped into the screenplay y the movies only nod to political correctnessi give this movie a10 out of 10; in time it will be acknowledged as a great film<SEP>1
i first saw ice age in the subiaco cinemas when it came out back in 02 i was only 13 at the time but even then i liked it it had some sort of warmthweve had it on video for a number of years now and no matter how many times you watch it it never gets boring this is because of the one element which makes it different from all of the other 3d animations made at the time - the characters have no particular home which they leave they are nomads and thats really refreshing and uplifting to watchalso each individual character on the surface appear to be just putting up with each other but theyre really all good friends as well all of the characters have their own charms even the bad guys sid the sloth is charming in his annoying over-affectionate and naive sort of way manny is adorable in his depressed reclusive character and so on and so forthanother great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation all the environments and characters were modeled originally by clay giving the film an artistic edgeanother aspect that adds to the feel of the movie is that gender means very little there are hardly any female characters but you dont really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film due to this theres also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice ageall in all ice age is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into 3d animations before shrek 2 and the incredibles came out<SEP>1
for getting so many positive reviews this movie really disappointed me! it is slow moving and long at times the story is not clear particularly in the evolving relationships among characters my advice read the book its a fabulous story which loses its impact on screen<SEP>0
night of the comet starts as the world prepares for a once in a lifetime event the passing of a 65 million plus year old comet instead of watching the light show regina belmont catherine mary stewart decides to spend the night with cinema projectionist larry dupree michael bowen in his booth they awake the next morning & as larry attempts to leave the cinema he is attacked & killed by a zombie the same zombie attacks regina but she manages to escape where upon she discovers that almost everyone on the entire planet has been turned into red dust almost everyone because by some amazing coincidence the only other person to survive happens to be her sister samantha kelli maroney they desperately search for more survivors & meet up with a long distance trucker named hector gomez robert beltran meanwhile an evil bunch of scientists need human blood to develop a serum to save themselves from turning into dust & theyre on the look out for unwilling donorswritten & directed by thom eberhardt i found night of the comet a pretty rubbish viewing experience im surprised at the amount of positive comments on imdb about it because i just thought it was boring crap that never lived up to its potential the script starts off 100 miles an hour with the obliteration of the entire population of earth & a zombie attack but then it goes absolutely nowhere & then eventually introduces the sinister blood stealing scientists towards the end of the film because by that time the slim story has run its course there are plot holes too if these scientists want blood why shoot the three or four gang members & save the two sisters when the guys would have provided more blood for their experiments killing them just seemed a totally bizarre & an almost suicidal thing to do considering they need blood to develop a cure it just doesnt make sense i mean if your going to die & you need to experiment on human blood would rather have five or six donors providing blood or just two im not having the fact that the two sisters survived independently of each other i mean what are the odds on that when hector confronts the female scientist for the first time she never mentions samantha or where she was or where the underground facility was where they took regina before she committed suicide so how did hector know these things i also thought after the first twenty odd minutes the film slows down to a snails pace & became incredibly boring & dull to watch after hearing so many good things about it night of the comet comes across to me as nothing more than an overrated boring piece of crapdirector eberhardt does a really good job i liked the look of the film with its red tinted sky & he manages to create a really cool atmosphere of isolation unfortunately there are far too many shots of empty streets there are constant montages of empty streets deserted roads & abandoned buildings & it gets extremely repetitive & dull ok we get it theres no one else about so theres no need to keep ramming it down our throats by constantly showing roads without cars on them the zombies are totally wasted there are two zombie attacks in the entire film & thats two individual zombies as well although there are a couple of effective nightmare scenes night of the comet pays homage or rips-off whichever you prefer several other much better films including the obligatory end of the world shopping spree in a mall lifted from dawn of the dead 1978 forget about any blood or gore as there isnt anytechnically night of the comet is pretty good the special effects are decent enough & the production crew were obviously very good at closing streets off the acting was alright expect for maroney as samantha the air-head blonde who became highly irritatingnight of the comet was a big disappointment for me i had hoped for so much more persoanlly i found this film dull boring uneventful & the puke inducing sequence where the sisters go shopping to the tune of girls just wanna have fun is probably the worst moment in the film really bad & i just dont get why so many people like this im sure ill get slaughtered for saying it so let the abuse begin i can take it<SEP>0

a recent post here by a woman claiming a military background contained the comment a womans life is no more valuable than a mansthis mantra of the politically correct is not true as history as well as biology show societies have managed to recover from heavy losses of their male population sometimes with astonishing speed germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the 1914- 1918 war in which over two million of her men were killed in south americas war of the triple alliance 1865 paraguay took on three neighboring countries until virtually her entire male population was wiped out but fought to a stalemate in the 1932 chaco war against much larger boliviano society however has or ever could survive the loss of its female population only when the very life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight israel faced that situation in 1948 but since then has never considered coed combat units for its defense forces despite the popular image of the israeli girl soldiergi jane is hollywood fluff<SEP>0
i love a good war film and i fall into the been there done that category so i would like to think my review is an accurate one imho having just watched this film on dvd i can safely say that it was a pile of rubbish there is no way i can recommend this film to youit started off with me shouting at the tv saying you wouldnt do that etcbut i soon realised that having a bit of job experience would be a hindrance so i chilled a bit but on the opening scene when the trailer wheel fell off i got a nasty feeling that this film would be a predictable dudi was rightthere simply wasnt any logic to the eod scenes i just know that the army team had some of the most patient insurgents ever at the other end of the command wire or remote trigger so much so i was left scratching my head all the time then just when you think you know where the story is going the guys in the humvee are off out on their own driving around the desert one of the most valuable assets in theatre out on a jolly bumping into some sas wannabe contractorsthe sniper scene was just so laughable it just made no sense at all and made me want to switch off there and then then for them to drag it out so long really did test my patienceit started with the contact right and went down hill fast if you had a brit accent then you got shot but if you were part of the eod team then suddenly you were a great shot and saved the day then just as you thought it was over it stretched on for an inexplicably long period without adding anything to the story at all you are just left watching and asking why hasnt it ended yetthen we had the booze scene where they just hit each other for a laughanother scene where you just wanted it to end it added nothing to the filmthen just as my life seemed very dull the main star went outside the wire to hunt someone down this most be the most ridiculous scene i have ever watched it defied all logic and ability to write a good storylineit was senseless and awful i still dont understand why they wasted time on it then to watch him just jog through the busy streets heading back to camp had me rolling on the floor with laughter pure comedy :the sad fact is that this storyline is all over the show without really deciding what it wants to be i thought it was going to be stupid illogical eod scenes but then it kept going off on tangents trying to be something different but as hard as it tried it just bored me to death all i wanted was for it to end it was a messy compilation of stupid scenes mixed into a batch of stupid senseless actionish scenesthere is no way i can recommend this maybe my work experience compromised the enjoyability but even the naive must realise this just doesnt make sense the only thing more stupid than this film is the artificially high imdb ratingwhich must be the 247 work of the box office pr team who seem to use this website as a way of making everyone think it is good sorry folksit just aint!not recommendedit will just bore you<SEP>0
not even the most ardent stooge fan could possibly like the movie i one of them the stooges just arent given any material to work with it is really a shame too because this is the only feature length movie the stooges did with curly and this one effort by them is painfully unfunny when it could have had great potential awful musical numbers dont help any either the short they did with the same title has more laughs<SEP>0
a double life has developed a mystique among film fans for two reasons: the plot idea of an actor getting so wrapped up into a role here othello as to pick up the great flaw of that character and put it into his life; and that this is the film that won ronald colman the academy award as well as the golden globe as best actor lets take the second point firstis anthony john colmans greatest role or even his signature role i have my doubts on either level - but it is among his best known roles most of his career ronald colman played decent gentlemen frequently in dangerous or atypical situations he is bulldog drummond cleaned up in the goldwyn production not to be an arrogant racist fighting crime he is raffles the great cricket player and even greater burglar trying to pull off his best burglary to save a friends honor he is robert conway the great imperial political figure who is kidnapped and brought to that paradise on earth shangri-la he is dick heldar manfully going to his death after he learns his masterpiece has been destroyed and knowing he is now blind and useless as an artist i can add sidney carton and rudolf rassendyll to this list but here he is not heroic in fact he is unconsciously villainous - he murders one person and nearly kills two others it does not matter that he is obviously mentally ill - his behavior here is anti-socialto me colman should have gotten the oscar for heldar or carton or conway - all more typical of his acting roles but the academy has a long tradition of picking atypical roles for awarding its treasure to its leading members colmans anthony john is a very good performance and at one point truly scary when alone with signe hasso in her home she at the top of a staircase and him at the base they have an argument she demands that tony leave saying she wont see him he stares at her his face oddly hardening in a way he never used before and he says oh no you wont! he starts moving upstairs frightening hasso and she runs into her room he stops himself and leaves it actually is the real highpoint of his performance - even more than his assaulting of hasso on stage or of edmond obrien or his killing of shelley winters it showed his blind fury for that moment it was to me an oscar-worthy performance but it is only that moment im glad he was recognized for the role but he should have gotten the award for a more consistent performancehis actual performance in the shakespearian role of othello is not great but bearable too frequently he lets the dialog roll off his tongue in a kind of forced singing style one wonders if that was due to the coaching of walter hampden who probably knew how to handle the role properly or a reaction to it nowadays othello is played by an african american actor more frequently than a white one paul robesons brilliant performance in the role set that new tradition firmly into place but the three best known movie performances of the part are those of colman orson welles in his movie of othello and laurence olivier in his movie of his play production of othello all three white actors did the role in black face my personal favorite of the three is welles who seems the most subtle but even watching welles fine film version makes me angry that robeson never got to put his performance with jose ferrer as iago on filmnow the first question - can an actor get that wrapped up in a role i heard different things about this some actors have admitted taking a role home with them from the theater or movie set others have found a role they have to be stimulating influencing them on a new cause of action regarding their lives or some aspect of life but actually i have never heard of anyone who turned homicidal as the result of a role it seems a melodramatic hackneyed ideaas a matter of fact it was not a new idea in 1947 with cukor kanin and gordon in 1944 a b feature the brighton strangler starring john loder had used a similar plot about an actor who is playing an infamous jack the ripper type and who starts committing those type of killings after an accident affects his mind there was an earlier movie in the 1930s in which an actor playing othello gets jealous of his wife i think the title was men are not gods but im not sure but due to colmans name and career and cukors directing it is a double life that people think of when they recall this plot idea it even reached comedy finally on an episode of cheers where diane chambers is helping an ex-convict who may have acting talent and they put on othello at the bar just after he sees her with sam malone kissing only diane is aware of the personality problem of the ex-convict and cant delay the production long enough she tries to start a discussion into the history and symbolism of the play the cast of a double life was first rate and cukors direction was as sure as ever so the film is definitely worth watching but despite giving colman an interestingly different role it was not his best work on the screen<SEP>1

the man in the white suit like im all right jack takes a dim view of both labor and capital alec guinness is a scientific genius - but an eccentric one he has never gotten his university degree due to anerraccident in a college laboratory he manages to push himself into various industrial labs in the textile industry when the film begins he is in michael goughs company and gough in a memorable moment is trying to impress his would-be father-in-law cecil parker by showing him the ship-shape firm he runs while having lunch with parker and parkers daughter joan greenwood gough gets a message regarding some problems about the labs unexpectedly large budget problems he reads the huge expenditures due to guinnesss experiments and chokes on his coffeeguinness goes on to work at parkers firm and repeats the same tricks he did with gough - but parker discovers it too greenwood has discovered what guinness is working on and convinces parker to continue the experiments but now legally the result: guinness and his assistant has apparently figured out how to make an artificial fiber that can constantly change the electronic bonds within its molecular structure so that for all intents and purposes the fiber will remain in tact for good any textile made from it will never fade get dirty or wear out - it will last foreverguinness has support from a female shop steward but not her chief he sees guinness as selling out to the rich but when he explains to them what hes done they turn against him if everyone has clothes that will last forever then they will not need new clothes! soon parkers fellow textile tycoons led by gough ernest theisinger - in a wonderful performance and howard marion-crawford are equally panic stricken by what may end their businesses they seek to suppress the invention with only greenwood in his corner although parker sort of sympathizes with him guinness tries to get the news of his discovery to the publicin the end guinness is defeated by science as well as greed but he ends the film seeing the error in his calculations and we guess that one day he may still pull off his discovery after allits a brilliant comedy but is the argument for suppression valid at one point the difficulties of making the textile are shown you have to heat the threads to a high temperature to actually enable the ends of the material to be united there is nothing that shows the cloth will stretch if the owner gets fat or contract if the owner gets thin are we to believe that people only would want one set of clothing for ever what happened to fashion changes and new styles and the cloth is only made in the color white making guinness look like a white knight we are told that color dye would have to be added earlier in the process wouldnt that have an effect on the chemical reactions that maintain the structure of the textile alas this is not a science paper but a film about the hypocrisies of labor and capital in modern industry as such it is brilliant but those questions i mention keep bothering me about the validity of suppressing guinness invention<SEP>1
perhaps more than many films this one is not for everyone for some folks the idea of slowing down reflecting and allowing things to happen in their own time is a good description of their personal hell for others an approach like this speaks to some deep part of themselves they know exists some part they long for contact withi suppose its a function of where i am in my own life these days but i count myself in the camp of the latter group i found the meditative pace of this film almost hypnotic gently guiding me into some realm almost mythological this is indeed a journey story a rich portrayal of the distance many of us must travel if we are to come full circle at the end of our daysmuch as been written of mr farnsworths presentation of alvin straight though im not sure there are words to express the exquisite balance of bemused sadness and wise innocence he conjured for us knowing now that he was indeed coming to terms with his own mortality as he sat on that tractor seat makes me wish i had had the opportunity to spend time with him before his departure i hope he had a small glimmer of the satisfaction and truth he had brought to so many people not just for acting but for sharing his absolute humanity with such brutal honestygiven the realities of production economics im not sure full credit has been given mr lynch for the courage he showed in allowing the story to develop so slowly an outsider to film production i nonetheless understand there are few areas of modern life where the expression time is money is so accurately descriptive going deep into our hearts is not an adventure that can be rushed and to his credit mr lynch seems to have understood that he was not simply telling a story--he was inviting his viewers to spend some time with their own mortality no simple task thatif youd like to experience the power of film to take introduce you to some precious part of yourself you could do worse than spending a couple of hours with the straight story and then giving yourself some time for the next little while simply listening to its echoes in the small hours of the night<SEP>1
i very nearly walked out but id paid my money and my nearly-as-disgusted friend wanted to hold out after the endearing wide-eyed innocence of a new hope and the thrilling sophistication of the empire strikes back i remember awaiting return of the jedi with almost aching anticipation but from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage i was bitterly disappointed and enraged at lucas he should have been ashamed of himself but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesnt have subatomic particle of shame in his cold greedy heart episode i would go on to reinforce this fact -- your honor i call jarjar binks but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury firstfrom the initial raising of the gate at jabbas lair this film was nothing more than a two-plus-hour commercial for as many licensable profit-making action figures as lucas could cram into it -- the pig-like guards the hokey flesh-pigtailed flunky that vile muppet-pet of jabbas the new and recycled cabaret figures the monsters etc etc ad vomitum then there were the detestably cute and marketable ewoks pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens fifteen seconds each on-screen or less and the kiddies just gotta have one for their collection the blatant exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseatinglucas didnt even bother to come up with a new plot -- he just exhumed the death star from a new hope and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment what an appalling slap in the face to his fans i cant shake the notion that lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans: ive got these lemmings hooked so bad that i can crank out the worst piece of stinking putrid garbage that i could dream up and theyll flock to the theaters to scarf it up plus all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped cartoonish caricature that i stuffed in and i get a cut from every single one itll make me even more obscenely richthere may have been a paltry partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip-off i seem to recall that harrison ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool but whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that lucas so avariciously embraced in this total absolute sell-out to profit<SEP>0
this is without doubt the best documentary ever produced giving an accurate and epic depiction of world war 2 from the invasion of poland in 1939 to the end of the war in 1945honest and to the point this documentary presents views from both sides of the conflict giving a very human face to the war at the same time tactics and the importance of battles are not overlooked much work has been put into the giving a detailed picture of the war and in particularly the high low and turning points in the allies fortunes being a british produced documentary this 26 part series focus is mainly on britain but russia and americas contribution are not skimmed over this is but one such advantage of a series of such lengthanother worthy mention is the score the music and the whole feel of the documentary is one of turmoil struggle and perseverance like a film this series leaves the viewer in no doubt of the hardship faced by the allies and the germans during the war its build to a climax at the end of every episode which serves to layer the coarse of the second world war after watching all 26 the viewer is left with an extensive knowledge about the war and astonished at just how much we owe to the members of the previous generation<SEP>1
there is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or a producer: actress nichole hiltz she is the show in this slow moving and wildly unlikely story of revenge directed by simon gornick the film stars joyce hyser as a betrayed wife who decides to seek revenge on her cheatin spouse oh but not by conventional means she plans a total guerrilla war and recruits bad girl nichole hiltz as her weapon of choice she wants nichole as tuesday to get close to her ex the handsome but dull stephan jenkins who should stick to music to embarrass him and ruin his life david deluise is good in his few brief moments and former crime story star anthony dennison is given virtually nothing to do but scowl hiltz on the other hand comes off at various times as sexy and playful then evil and devious she also handles vulnerable and maybe a bit psychotic well shes also quite hot though theres no naughty bits show so you can understand how she might be able to get to any guy she is aimed at but the performance is kind of wasted in this movie which is just not edgy or interesting enough to recommend<SEP>0
this is one of the best crime-drama movies during the late 1990s it was filled with a great cast a powerful storyline and many of the players involved gave great performances pacino was great; he should have been nominated for something john cusack was good too as long as the viewer doesnt mind his louuu-siana accent he may come off as annoying if you cant stand this dialect the way that pacinos character interacted with cusacks character was believable dramatic and slightly comical at times danny aiello was superb as always david paymer was great in a supporting role bridget fonda was good but not memorable there were times when this picture mentioned so many characters probably too many it may take a second viewing to remember which zapatti was which after so many cross-references one has to stop and think just to recap the ending didnt have a lot of sting it was built up for so long and then was a bit of a letdown this was one of the few problems with the film since the movie wasnt billed as a huge blockbuster big screen hit it made some forget that this movie even existed pacino and aiello were great but the films lack of splash in the theaters may have accounted for no nominations it was semi-successful in the home market and viewers are still learning that this title is out there made in 1996 it still stands up today and will remain popular for many years to comeso make yourself some lemon pudding youll see and see this movie!<SEP>1
my father was the warden of the prison he is retired now showcased in this documentary and ive grown up around the prison life so perhaps my views will be totally different from everyone else who watches this movie i will say this the filmmakers who brought us this 93-minute miracle are fantastic artists and even better people they were brave enough to a show up and tell this story b get inside these inmates minds and hearts and c do all of this responsibly responsible to their art and more importantly responsible to the inmates and staff of luther luckett correctional complex they should be commended without end for this work to take 170 hours yes hours of footage and be able to cut and whittle it down to 93 riveting minutes is nothing short of extraordinary and they have my utmost respecti saw this film under circumstances that only a very very few were able to see it i was at the inmate screening i was in the same room with these men as they watched their hearts being poured out on screen i saw men crying on television crying in the chair in front of me and let me tell you it was a very profound experience these men have committed horrendous crimes in some cases yet have found ways to try to redeem themselves even if they view themselves as unredeemable how many of us have the courage to do this how many people could do what they have done in such a harsh environment to see them react to the film was an experience i am eternally grateful for and i will never forget that i thank the men who allowed me this glimpse into their lives i thank my father for making all of this possible and i thank philomath films for taking the time to pour their blood sweat soul and tears into this projectthis movie will change everything you think you know about prison life and the inmates held within it oz is not real television is not real shakespeare behind bars is<SEP>1
thank g_d it bombed or we might get treated to such delights as skate fu where we can see the likes of brian boitano performing a triple lutz & slashing bad guys to ribbons with his razor-sharp skates but i digress one thing that could have helped this turkey would have been a little t & a from ms agbayani its not like the world would have seen anything new at least that part of the world who saw her playboy spread i truly believe that porn would have suited her talents much better although aubrey hepburn couldnt have stayed afloat in this sewer one explanation for kurt thomas presence could be a traumatic brain injury possibly from coming up short too often on dismounts its a good thing the ioc wasnt as diligent on doping as they are now or kurt would surely have been stripped of his medals to be avoided at all costs<SEP>0
dolph lundgren stars as murray wilson an alcoholic ex-cop who gets involved with a serial killer who kills during sex after his brother is murdered wilson starts his own investigation and finds out a lot of his brothers secrets in this very dull thriller lundgren mails in his performance and the movie is flat and lethargic also when has anyone watched a dolph lundgren movie for anything but action<SEP>0
harold pinter rewrites anthony schaeffers classic play about a man going to visit the husband of his lover and having it all go sideways the original film starred laurence olivier and michael caine caine has the olivier role in this version and hes paired with jude law here the film is directed by kenneth branaughthe acting is spectacular both caine and law are gangbusters in their respective roles i really like the chemistry and the clashing of personalities its wonderful and enough of a reason to watch when the scripts direction goes haywireharold pinters dialog is crisp and sharp and often very witty and i understand why he was chosen to rewrite the play which is updated to make use of surveillance cameras and the likethe problem is that how the script moves the characters around is awful michale caine walks law through his odd modern house with sliding doors and panels for no really good reason conversations happen repeatedly in different locations i know pinter has done that in his plays but in this case it becomes tedious why do we need to have the pair go over and over and over the fact that law is sleeping with caines wife it would be okay if at some point law said enough weve done this but he doesnt he acts as if each time is the first time the script also doesnt move caine through his manipulation of law all that well to begin with hes blindly angry to start so he has no chance to turn around and scare usnever mind a late in the game revelation that makes you wonder why he bothered in the original we never suspected what was up here we do and while it gives an edge it also somehow feels false since its so clear we are forced to wonder why laws milo doesnt see hes being set up there are a few other instances but to say more would give away too muchthinking about the film in retrospect i think its a film of missed opportunities and missteps the opportunities squandered are the chance to have better fireworks between caine and law missteps in that the choice of a garish setting and odd shifts in plot take away from the creation of a tension and a believable thriller instead we get some smart dialog and great performances in a film that doesnt let them be realdespite some great performances and witty dialog this is only a 4 out of 10 because the rest of the script just doesnt work<SEP>0
i dont know what that other guy was thinking the fact that this movie was independently made makes it no less terrible you can be as big a believer as you want the majority of this film is mindless drivel i feel i have been insulted by having to watch the first 40 minutes of it and that alone was no small feat not only is the acting terrible but the plot is never even close to developed there are countless holes in the story to the point where you can hardly even call it a story anymore ive never read the book so i cant critique on that but this is the first review that ive written here and its purpose is solely to save all you viewers out there an hour and a half of your life i cant remember the last time i couldnt even finish watching a movie this one really takes the cake<SEP>0
a very good start i was a bit surprised to find the machinery not quite so advanced: it should have been cruder to match we saw in the original series the cast is interesting although the vulkan lady comes across as a little too human she needs to school on spock who after all is the model for this race too bad they couldnt have picked jeri ryan i like ms park the koreanlady the doctor has possibilities havent sorted out the other males except for the black guy hes a really likeable bakula needs to find his niche--in ql his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything he is of course big and strong enough for the heroics the heavies were ok although i didnt like their make-up<SEP>1
im among millions who consider themselves cary grant fans but i cant think of a single reason to recommend this moviei dont understand the casting of betsy drake and it appears no one else didif were to judge from the small number of films in which she played afterwardsmost fans will agree that katharine hepburn was superb at chasing and catching cary grant in bringing up babyhere the director or writers try to rehash the ideabut it fails miserablyive read comments about how creepy drake wasbut i thought that was far too mild a description franchot tone walked through this one as if he were hungovera casting disaster is one thingthis film is a total disasterthis one doesnt deserve 10 lines of comments and i dont know why thats a requirementtoo bad this one was preserved when so many worthwhile films lie rotting in vaultsunless you want to torture someonegive this one a wide berth<SEP>0
i saw this little magnum opus for the first time very recently on one of those dollar dvds that seem to be everywhere nowadays and was so moved by it that i cannot contain myself for those who have never seen this mesmerizingly miserable mexican import and wish to view it without being prejudiced by anyone elses jaundiced commentary there are undoubtedly substantial spoilers in what follows so if you are one of those reckless individuals stop reading at once and go and watch it for yourself if you get drunk enough in advance you might be fortunate enough to pass out before its overbegin with the premise that a man may become a werewolf after being bitten by a yeti no one in the film ventures an explanation as to how this sort of cross-species implantation could occur and the rest of the movie is even more hopelessly nonsensical but pour yourself another glass of wine or whatever youre drinking and let us proceedpaul naschy our werewolf has the look of a man fighting a toothache in a town where the only dentist has traded his supply of novocaine for a case of cheap whiskey and has been drunk ever since aint he the lucky one naschys facial expression never varies whether in or out of makeup and apparently no one gave him any coaching on how to act like a werewolf occasionally he tries to imitate the lon chaney jr crouch but most of the time he simply strolls around in his black mafia shirt like just another cool dude with a tad too much facial hair to be fair the makeup is actually better than the actor inside of it but the continuity is infinitely worse naschys werewolf is the only one i can think of that changes shirts twice in the middle of a prowl he goes from black shirt to red shirt then back to black then back to red then back to black all in a single frenzied night interestingly enough he always does the chaney crouch while wearing the red shirt and the cool dude walk while wearing the black shirt and its only while he is wearing the red shirt that we see much of the fury alluded to in the title presumably theres something about that red shirt that just brings out the animal in himso anyway after being bitten by the cross-pollinating yeti the poor schmuck returns home from tibet to learn that his wife has been sleeping with one of his students the two illicit lovers try to murder him by adjusting the brakes on his car he survives the wreck and makes it home just in time for a full moon then after chewing up his wife and her lover he wanders off again and somehow manages to get himself electrocuted but is that enough can they let this tormented wretch rest in peace not a chance he is resurrected by a supposed female scientist with a hardcore sm fetish otherwise known as the doctor and definitely not a new incarnation of doctor who she digs him up and whisks him away to her kinky kastle takes him down to the dungeon chains him to the wall and gives him a damn good flogging presumably such a string of indignities ought to be enough to put a little fury into any wolfmanafter his two-shirted rampage our wolfman spends most of the rest of the film wandering around the castle trying to find a way out and who can blame him in the course of his wanderings he encounters a bewilderingly incoherent assortment of clichés including a man dressed in medieval armor a curiously inept phantom of the opera impersonator supposedly the doctors father and a hard-partying cadre of bondage slavesso whats it all about one may reasonably ask one gets the vague impression that it has something to do with mind control and involves something the doctor calls chemotrodes best guess i really have no idea how its spelled if there even is such a thing mercifully the experiment ends in failure and most importantly it endsbefore one has time to gnaw ones own leg offof course one doesnt really expect any sense from a film like this but at least it ought to be good for laughs this one isnt forget it buddy there is a creeping sort of anarchy about this film from its patched-together tequila-drenched ambiance to its atrocious cinematography and agonizing musical score that defies even the most sozzled attempts to get any mst3k type laughs out of it if its not even good for that what the hell is it good for if montezumas revenge could have somehow been digitally remastered and put on a dvd it would have looked exactly like this movie<SEP>0
a kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia extremely well done and polanski performs well as the diffident introvert trying hard to adapt to his dingy paris lodgings and his fellow lodgers horrifying early on because of the seeming mean and self obsessed fellow tenants and horrifying later on as he develops his defences which will ultimately be his undoing personally i could have done without the cross dressing element but i accept the nod to psycho and the fact that it had some logic bearing in mind the storyline nevertheless it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly theatrical element but then maybe that was intended because the courtyard certainly seems to take on the look of a theatre at the end i cant help feel that there are more than a few of the directors own feelings of not being a real frenchman and jewish to boot still there is plenty to enjoy here including a fine performance from a gorgeous looking isabelle adjani and good old shelly winters is as reliable as ever<SEP>1
i like it because of my recent personal experience especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite the characters in the firm did not really enjoy their real lives but they did enjoy themselves ie what they were the movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory a good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful european city but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those before sunrise dealt with it in a nice way which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film before sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head it just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities this made the conversations between the characters interesting not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas you would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story the end was not quite important after all you could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie movies are supposed to be enjoyable this is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it i am on a journey too the movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions<SEP>1
carla works for a property developers where she excels in being unattractive unappreciated and desperate she is also deafher boss offers to hire in somebody to alleviate her heavy workload so she uses the opportunity to secure herself some male company help arrives in the form of paul a tattooed hoodlum fresh out of prison and clearly unsuited to the mannered routine of an office environmentan implicit sexual tension develops between the two of them and carla is determined to keep him on despite his reluctance to embrace the working week when carla is edged out of an important contract she was negotiating by a slimy colleague she exploits pauls criminality by having him steal the contract back the colleague quickly realises that shes behind the robbery but when he confronts her pauls readiness to punch people in the face comes in handy too - but this thuggery comes at a price paul is given a going over by some mob acquaintances as a reminder about an unpaid debt he formulates a plan which utilises carlas unique lip reading abilities to rip-off a gang of violent bank robbers its now carlas turn to enter a frightening new worldthe fourth feature from director jacques audiard read my lips begins as a thoroughly engaging romantic drama between two marginalised losers only to shift gears halfway through into an edgy thriller where their symbiotic shortcomings turn them into winners the leads are excellent; effortlessly convincing us that this odd couple could really connect carlas first meeting with paul is an enjoyable farce in which she attempts to circumnavigate his surly reticence and jailbird manners only to discover that he was until very recently a jailbird emmanuelle devos who plays carla has that almost exclusive ability to go from dowdy to gorgeous and back again within a frame vincent cassel plays paul as a cornered dog who only really seems at home when hes receiving a beating or concocting the rip-off that is likely to get him killedlike many french films read my lips appears at first to be about nothing in particular until you scratch beneath the surface and find that its probably about everything the only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of pauls parole officer; a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little feelgood cul-de-sacit was the french new wave of the 60s that first introduced the concept of genre to film making and ive always felt that any medium is somewhat compromised when you have to use a system of labels to help define it; so its always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend genre or better still defy it<SEP>1
as far as films go this is likable enough entertaining characters good dialogue interesting enough story i would have really quite liked it had i not been irritated immensely whilst watching at the utter disrespect it shows the city it is set inglasgow in scotland yet every character is english save for seans girlfriend who is dutch scottish accents are heard only fleetingly in menial jobs & roles as a scottish woman & as a viewer who likes her real life films to be a bit more like real life i really dont think it would have hurt to use any one of the countless talented scottish actorsor at least got english ones who could toss together a decent accent! the futile attempt at using the word wee a few times did nothing but to further the insult<SEP>0
kate miller angie dickinson is having problems in her marriage and otherwise--enough to see a psychologist when her promiscuity gets her into trouble it also involves a bystander liz blake nancy allen who becomes wrapped up in an investigation to discover the identity of a psycho killerdressed to kill is somewhat important historically it is one of the earlier examples of a contemporary style of thriller that as of this writing has extensions all the way through hide and seek 2005 its odd then that director brian de palma was basically trying to crib hitchcock for example de palma literally lifts parts of vertigo 1958 for dressed to kills infamous museum scene dressed to kills shower scenes as well as its villain and method of death have similarities to psycho 1960 de palma also employs a prominent score with recurrent motifs in the style of hitchcocks favorite composer bernard herrmann the similarities do not end therebut de palma whether by accident or skill manages to make an oblique turn from or perhaps transcend his influence with dressed to kill having an attitude structure and flow that has been influential maybe partially because of this influence dressed to kill is also deeply flawed when viewed at this point in time countless subsequent directors have taken their hitchcock-like de palma and honed it improving nearly every element so that watched now after 25 years worth of influenced thrillers much of dressed to kill seems agonizingly paced structurally clunky and plot-wise ineptone aspect of the film that unfortunately hasnt been improved is dressed to kills sex and nudity scenes both dickinson and allen treat us to full frontal nudity allens being from a very skewed angle and de palma has lingering shots of dickinsons breasts strongly implicit masturbation and more visceral sex scenes than are usually found in contemporary films quite a few scenes approach soft-core porn im no fan of prudishness--quite the opposite our cultures puritanical monogamistic sheltered attitude towards sex and nudity is disturbing to me so from my perspective its lamentable that dressed to kills emphasis on flesh and its pleasures is one of the few aspects in which others have not strongly followed suit or trumped the film perhaps it has been desired but they have not been allowed to follow suit because of cultural controls from conservative stuffed shirtsde palmas direction of cinematography and the staging of some scenes are also good enough that it is difficult to do something in the same style better than de palma does it he has an odd characteristic approach to close-ups and hes fond of shots from interesting angles such as overhead views and james whale-like tracking across distant cutaways in the sets of course later directors have been flashier but its difficult to say that theyve been better viewed for film-making prowess at least the museum scene is remarkable in its ability to build very subtle tension over a dropped glove and a glance or two while following kate through the intricately nested cubes of the metropolitan museum of arton the other hand from a point of view caring about the story and especially if one is expecting to watch a thriller everything through the museum scene and slightly beyond might seem too slow and silly because of its removal from the main genre of the film and its primary concern with directorial panache as well as cultural facts external to the film the opening seems like a not very well integrated attempt to titillate and be risqué once the first murder occurs things improve but because of the films eventual influence much of the improvement now seems a bit clichéd and occasionally hokeythe performances are mostly good although michael caine is underused and dickinson has to exit sooner than wed like but the exit is necessary and very effective dressed to kill is at least likely to hold your interest until the end but because of facts not contained in the picture itself hasnt exactly aged well at this point it is perhaps best to watch the film primarily as a historical relic and as an example--but not the best even for that era--of some of de palmas directorial flair<SEP>1
i dont think any movie of van dammes will ever beat universal soldier but u never know this movie was good but not as good as 1st vd returns a luc & must do battle again he tries 2 b funny here but its maybe worth a smirk of a chuckle vd has a kid this time from ally w good it showed a pic of them 2 goldberg was cool he does his famous move-forgot what its called cause i dont watch wrestling-sucks vd & goldberg had some good fights it was the ending like the 1st but just not that good vd does his best move in his career like always-the helicopter kick even though the final ending shouldve been longer anyway it is worth seeing but it will never top the original<SEP>0
a fantastic arabian adventure a former king ahmad and his best friend the thief abu played by sabu of black narcissus search for ahmads love interest who has been stolen by the new king jaffar conrad veidt theres hardly a down moment here its always inventing new adventures for the heroes personally i found ahmad and his princess a little boring theres no need to ask why john justin who plays ahmad is listed fourth in the credits conrad veidt always a fun actor makes a great villain and sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves who at one point finds a genie in a bottle i also really loved miles malleson as the sultan of basra the father of the princess he collects amazing toys from around the world jaffar bribes him for his daughters hand with a mechanical flying horse this probably would count as one of the great childrens films of all time but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when abu and the genie are on screen together and the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful although most of the younger generation probably thinks that king kong looks bad at this point in time willis obriens stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesnt even look remotely like a spider 810<SEP>1
star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning this second instalment of the che films moves the story forward to the late 60s where the man has now moved his resistance fighters into the hills of south america surviving without enough food and water and with tensions mounting between the group everything comes to a head when he crosses the border into bolivia and the government forces step up their campaign to bring him downwithout the flitting between time and places of the last film soderberghs second instalment focuses solely on the action in the hills and manages to be an even duller experience and more pretentiously the score has been drowned out giving the second instalment more of an unwelcome air of artsieness that proves just as alienating theres just an unshakeable air of boredom to the film that never lets up you cant fault soderberghs ambition or del toros drive in the lead role its just a shame that somewhere in the production things managed to take such a disappointing turn **<SEP>0
zombie chronicles isnt something to shout about its obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining b-movie directed by brad sykes who directed camp blood which was another entertaining low budget flick the acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but thats what makes it more entertaining the zombie make-up is cool and effective especially with the budget the gore is also great and gross the film is sort of like a zombie version of tales from the crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale zombie chronicles is a lot better than some low budget zombie movies out there if you love low budget b-movies or cheaply made zombie flicks then check out zombie chronicles<SEP>1
i was skeptical when i first saw the calvin kline-esque commercials but thought id give it a chance so ive watched it and all i can say is bleh this movie was so bad its rare that i hate a movie this much watching this flick reminded me of those funny scenes in altmans the player when the writers pitch their bizarre ideas to producers id like to know which mtv producer decided that an hour and a half long music video adaptation of bronte but this time heathcliffs name is heath and hes a rock star and hindleys name is hendrix would be a good ideaeven that might not have been so bad had they not gotten every other aspect of the film so horrible wrong as well the direction must have been youre lonely pout for me i laughed out loud during all the serious scenes and was bored throughout the rest the camera work was jagged and repeatedly reminded me that i was watching a bad movie trying to be edgy my theory is that the sound guy got bored and went down to the beach for a few beers with his boom -- all i could hear in half the scenes were the waves and in the other scenes i wish thats all i could hear and speaking of sound what they did to the sisters of mercy song more is absolutely inexcusable then again its inexcusable what they did to bronteon the bright side there was one entertaining scene -- specifically the moment when johnny whitworth licked katherine heigls face -- and if you can tell me what that scene had to do with all the rest of the story more power to you<SEP>0
a friend once asked me to read a screenplay of his that had been optioned by a movie studio to say it was one of the most inept and insipid scripts id ever read would be a bold understatement yet i never told him this why because in a world where films like while she was out can be green-lighted and attract an oscar- winning star like kim basinger a screenplay lacking in character content and common sense is no guarantee that it wont sellas so many other reviewers have pointed out while she was out is a dreadfully under-written woman-in-peril film that has abused housewife basinger hunted by four unlikely hoods on christmas eve every gripe is legitimate from the weak dialog and bad acting to the jaw-dropping lapses of logic but basinger is such an interesting actress and the premise is not without promise here are a couple of things that struck me:1 i dont care how much we are supposed to think her husband is a jerk the house is a mess with toys since when did it become child abuse to make kids pick up after themselves2 racially diverse gangs are rare everywhere except hollywood where they are usually the only racially balanced groups on screen3 sure the film is stupid but so are the countless thrillers ive sat through where the women are portrayed as wailing helpless victims of male sadism stupid or not i found it refreshing to see a woman getting the best of her tormentors4 i loved the ending! 5 though an earlier reviewer coined this phrase i really do think this film should be retitled the red toolbox of doom<SEP>0
aardman does it again next to pixar aardman animation proves again and again how to do animation properlyi had a great time watching the first episode of creature comforts i thought it translated well for american audiences my only concern is that most of the audiences arent going to get the subtle humor in this showhaving been a fan of the bbc version and the short film i knew what i was in for when i sat down to watch this the animators did a great job matching up pre-recorded voices to a perfect match animal look at the first episode with the goat who sounds stoned and the dogs on the street that keep calling each other dawgis this for everyone not by a long shot in fact id be happy to see the show last for a full season but like i said before audiences arent going to get it<SEP>1
ha without a doubt tommys the evil one here i dont know why but for some reason little kids in horror movies tend to come across as little butt munches and since theyre kids they wont die because theyre annoyingwellexcept for asylum of terror but those are few and far betweenanyway onto the movie cant find this movie on dvd sure you can! all you have to do is buy the chilling classics dvd pack! not only do you get metamorphosis on dvd for $15 but you also get 49 other movies! what a bargain! pff ok im done advertising for these cheesy movies lets just say this movie aint worth the 15 bucks on its ownso we have a chemist scientist yeah cause all chemist scientists look as handsome as this guy playing peter hes trying to come up with a serum to stop deterioration of the body the college he works at wants to pull the plug on his project so he tries it on himself but because this is a horror movie he sucks it up and starts and incredibly long transformation sequence that takes nearly 34 of the movieto pad out the movie he gets into a relationship with some woman who has a son and she was never married! scandalous! but of course tommy is one of the most irritating charactersno i take it back he is the most irritating character far worse than the old crippled guy who wants to take over peters work and gloats over him while hes in the hospital thats right even as an old cripple you can still be the villainso we see peter start to randomly kill some people in visions he has until he realizes hes the one doing it and just decides to kill everyone in his path to get back to normal however at the end he ends up de-evolving into a lizard yeah i know dont ask the ending really doesnt make any sense and if youre hoping for any really good payoff youre not going to get itthis isnt a horrible movieits just frustrating because of the lack of a good payoff if you already own the 50 movie pack and this is next on your list youre not in for a snoozer but youre also not in for a great movie just sit back relax and eat a lot of snack food because this movie isnt going to be making you jump out of your skin anytime soonmetamorphosis gets 4 plastic lizard heads out of 10<SEP>0
at first i wasnt sure if i wanted to watch this movie when it came up on my guide so i looked it up on imdb and thought the cover looked pretty cool so i thought i would give it a try expecting a movie like elephantonce i got past the fact that i am supposed to dislike the alicia character played excellently by busy phillips i realized what a good job this movie was doing toward setting up the relationship between alicia and deanna alicia is so mean to deanna played by erika christensen almost throughout the entire movie but we eventually find out that they despite being polar opposites they have one thing in common besides being present at the shooting they share loneliness and to what extent is revealed as the film progressesive just got to say how much i loved this movie and was glad to see all of the positive comments about it i couldnt even get through elephant because it just seemed to be exploiting the columbine tragedy this movie on the other hand was compelling and realistic busy phillips acting is off the chain!!! that is a good thing and i would love to see her progress into some more mature roles<SEP>1
this movie is so bad that i cannot even begin to describe it what in the blazing pit is wrong with the writers producers and director how on earth did they get funding for this abomination the plot is laughable the acting is poor at best the story what story the first fight in this movie is ok but then it keeps repeating itself until you want to turn it offi guess im the biggest looser for not turning this stupid movie off after the first minute*** spoler alert ***i only saw this movie because scott adkins was in it and he is in it for 30 secondsi give it 1 out of 10 because its the lowest grade imdb has to offerdo yourself a favour: see an uwe boll movie instead twice its more worthy of your time<SEP>0
the impossible planet and the satan pit together comprise the two best episodes of the new doctor whos second season having said that it should be obvious that much of the story basically transposes the plot of quatermass and the pit 1967 to an outer space setting with the history of the universe intertwined with that of the beast 666 these episodes cement the emotional ties between rose and the doctor whilst also highlighting roses increasing self-confidence establishing her as a not-quite-equal-yet-but-getting-there partner with our beloved time lord also of note is matt jones elegant screenplay which decreases the occasional over-reliance on one-liners for the doctor and the performances of the entire cast most notably the excellent shaun parkes as acting captain zachary cross flane<SEP>1
i really really wanted to like julian po i think that slater is underrated as an actor and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film i realize this is based on a short story which i have not read so i do not know if what i see as the films faults originated with the story or were imposed on it by the directorscreenwriter the premise is wonderful and i loved the voiceover confessional tone the opening narration strikes but then nothing! several of the cliched local characters ask julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide one could argue that he doesnt answer because its none of their business but julian is the one who under only token pressure blurted out his intentions in public then neither julian nor the directorwriter despite the fact that the julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for gods sake seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on julians life he says he was a bookkeeper he says his family moved around when he was a child due to his fathers job so what there are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate julians purpose but none of them go anywhere because julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet as if he were the ultimate and only sane one among them this might work as an allegory if julian po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart the closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive religious wife of the mechanic and what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for julian i can only see the julian character --as rendered--as selfish petty and totally condescending sort of matches the attitude of the director of this half-baked contrived film and poor michael parks an actor who once had so much promise is given nothing to work with here<SEP>0
so steve irwin you have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that clearly is filled with crocs snakes lizards tons of poop from the aforementioned reptiles and mud not only daily but with enthusiasm he was never able to make me want to do it but he managed to make his wife come closethis movie does not fall into my parallel universe of film category - the films for people who just had their teeth drilled have a migraine or have no film experience and therefore like quiet mediocrity currently well populated by disney films its too noisy well steve is too noisy hes just so happy all the time and would cut right through the blasé teenager i can hear it now: that movie was so stupid or the tylenol with codeine id say his enthusiasm is catching but if it was i would own a room full of snakes and that hasnt happened yet i agreed theyre beauties but im still not going to pet themplot was indeed predictable bad guys were so bad for a minute there i thought i was shopping at a consumer electronic superstore but the movie was filled with animals and steve and terri which is why i watched it that plot if you could call it that was really more of a reason to throw yet another croc in a truck my expectations were low and stayed that wayi was hoping though that there would be a bit of a sequel where steve and terri having worked on their acting skills have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur i still cant believe we wont see steve anymore i hope that terri and the children continue to be involved in the australia zoo and the discovery channel at least i cant imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the irwin family telling me forcefully how wonderful that croc is crikey!<SEP>0
oh dear oh dear i started watching this not knowing what to expect i couldnt believe what i was seeing there were times when i thought it was a comedy i loved how the governments plan to capture the terrorist leader is to air drop in one man who is unarmed and expect him to capture him and escape with a rocket pack if only it were really that easy ive finally found a movie worse than plan 9 from outer space<SEP>0
another norman lear hit detailing the problems that african americans had to go through in the turbulent 1960s and 1970swith esther rolle and husband along with 3 children living in a chicago high-rise project in a predominantly black neighborhood the show depicted what black people were going through with a landlord black agent mr bookman as well as prices and the day-to-day problems of just existingthe 3 children depicted how people seem to face their problems differently- from the comical jj to the militant ralph carter to their daughter who also aspired to attain success this show was a perfect description of african-american life<SEP>1
on the way back from imc6 san jose california all five mind you three of us hardcore kamal fans of us had reached a unanimous verdict; vv was solid crap and thanks to the movie we were going to have a pretty screwed up monday not to mention we swore to stay off the theatres for the next yeari wont blame kamal here because he sort of dropped a hint in a recent interview with cartoonist madan on vijay tv he said something like tamizh cinemala photography editingla namba munnerana maadri screenplay direction actingla innum namba munnerala tamil cinema has grown in terms of photography and editing but we have hardly improved when it comes to screenplay direction and acting while youre watching vv those words ring very truenow here are the 10 reasons to hate this movie:1 harris jeyaraj2 harris jeyaraj3 harris jeyaraj im barely holding myself from using expletives here but fact is hj has mastered the fine knack of screwing up every recent movie of his remember anniyan ghajini with the jarring cacophony he bills as background music the next time i have an eardrum transplant hes paying for it 4 songs neither do the songs help move the movies narration spatiallytemporally nor do they make you sit up and take notice the film feels like its made of four very long songs with a few scenes thrown in between them5 a short gone too far vv at best is fit to be a short story not a 2 hour plus thriller to use a cliché here like the energizer bunny it goes on and on and on; only in this case you dont want it to the later part of a movie feels like a big drag6 kamal-jothika pairing two ice cubes rubbed together couldve produced more sparks than this lead pairing theres no reason you would root for them to make it together in fact every time they get together in the second half of the movie they make a good irritant to the narration hate to say this but kamalini mukerjhees 10 minute romancing does more than what kamal and jothika achieve in this movie plus thenali7 kamal haasans accent kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in india or in the us; and it isnt new either hes been doing it since thoongadae thambi thoongadae its simply gets on the nerve imagine what havoc it can cause when his flair for using this strange accent meets shooting on location in the us he doesnt leave it at the immigration either he offers doses of advice to his men bewildered tn cops from keeranor sathoor and beyond in chaste kamanglish wha we hav here is plain bad police wok of course with nauseating effect8 logic there are a few directors whom you expect to stand up to a certain scale gautam fails us badly with some crappy performance in the department of common sense which dcp in his senses would meet his love interest on the streets to discuss such matters as committing himself and life after! the scene inside the theatre was so bad towards the climax; we could hear people behind us loudly challenge the heros iq is he stupid cant he just use his siren or lights on a busy madras road kamal-the-cop-on-a-police-jeep chases a guy on a bike just like any ordinary dude! cant he just use his gun the guy on a bike starts on foot and we have a fully geared kamal in hot pursuit for a considerable amount of time im not voting in favour of the later but im just trying to explain the mood inside9 gore & violence if i wanted to watch women being raped their throats getting slashed more women getting raped and thrown into the bushes with excruciating authenticity i would sit at home and rather watch a police report or kuttram the use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend the story not overwhelm it! somewhere down the line gautum seems confused about what the extensions rapes murders are and what the mainstay story is!10 even a double shot espresso couldnt get the pain out of the head<SEP>0
i had a vague idea of who bettie page was partly due to her appearance in the very wee days of playboy apparently when she got her photo taken of her and her santa hat just that she didnt know what the mag was the movie co-written and directed by american psychos mary harron fleshes out the key parts of her life well enough a southern belle of a church goer has some bad experiences and leaves them behind to seek better times in new york city where she gets into modeling and from there a lot more soon she becomes the underground pin-up sensation with bondage the obvious and notorious of the title trait attributed to her the actress gretchen moll portrays her and gets down the spirit of this woman about as well as she could which is really a lot of the success of the film shes not a simplistic character even if at times her ideas of morality are questionable well adam and eve were naked werent they she comments a couple of times apparently the filmmakers leave out the later years of pages life and leave off with her in a kind of redemptive period leaving behind the photo shoots for jesusin all the notrious bettie page is not much more than a kind of usual bio-pic presented by hbo films albeit this time with the stamina for a feature-film release the best scenes that harron captures are page in her questionable positions getting photos of her in over-the-top poses and starring in ridiculous films of whips and chains and leather uniforms this adds a much needed comic relief to the films otherwise usual nature its not that the story behind it is uninteresting which involves the governments investigation into the smut that came out of such photos and underground magazines but there isnt much time given to explore more of what is merely hinted at with page and her complexities or her relationships or to sex and the fifties its all given a really neat black and white look and sometimes it seemed as if harron was progressing some of the black and white photos to be tinted more as it went along its a watchable view if youre not too knowledgeable of bette page and probably for fans too<SEP>1
this is easily one of the worst 5 movies ive ever seen its not scary or any of the other things suggested in the plot outline this movie is agonizingly slow and i was bored for almost all 98 minutes while the acting is mediocre at best the biggest problem is the script which is poorly written slow and plodding with no real direction occasionally an eerie mood is set only to be broken by some useless line or event im not surprised that the entire cast was sick and throwing up between shots they did after all have to try and digest a terrible script as a huge fan of good horror movies im always irritated that something this bad gets made save yourself 98 minutes youll never get back<SEP>0
well you know the rest! this has to be the worst movie ive seen in a long long time i can only imagine that stephanie beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this rolethe lead role is played by to me a complete unknown and i would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkeybruce lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70s and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques this movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts however even this cant disguise the fact that the lady doesnt know how to throw a punch an average 8 year old boy would take her apart on this showingsorry the only mystery on show here is how this didnt win the golden raspberry for its year<SEP>0
so the other night i decided to watch tales from the hollywood hills: natica jackson or power passion murder as it is called in holland when i bought the film i noticed that michelle pfeiffer was starring in it and i thought that had to say something about the quality unfortunately it didnt1 the plot of the film is really confusing there are two story lines running simultaneously during the film only they have nothing in common throughout the entire movie i was waiting for the moment these two story lines would come together so the plot would be clear to me but it still hasnt2 the title of the film says the film will be about natica jackson well it is sometimes like said the film covers two different stories and the part about natica jackson is the shortest so another title for this movie would not be a wrong choiceto conclude my story i really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs on the shelf in the store on a place nobody can see it by doing this you wont waste 90 minutes of your life as i did<SEP>0
the storyline is absurd and lamealso sucking are performances and the dialogue is hard to keep your eyes open i advise you to have a caffeine-propelled friend handy to wake you in time for a couple gore-effectswhy they bring alcatraz inin this casebecomes increasingly difficult to swallow all the while i wondered who this film aimed forchock full of lame subplots such as the cannibalism us army-captainthis is low-grade in every aspectbtw this movie is banned in germany!!<SEP>0
i saw the film tonight at a free preview screening and despite the fact that i didnt pay a dime to see this film i still felt ripped off ladies and gentlemen time is money and if you see this film you are leaving a benjamin on your seat the acting is torpid at best; kiefer sutherland phones in his worst impersonation of jack bauer and michael douglas looks like he realizes he made a bad choice leaving catherine zeta-jones for the duration it took to shoot this turkey eva longoria is a non-entity; she looks like shes reading her lines off a teleprompter and if you cant spot the mole within the first 20 minutes then you just landed on this planet from a world without tv and recycled story lines if you truly want to see a good secret service thriller rent in the line of fire if you see and buy into this one youll start to fear for the presidents safety because the secret service looks and acts like the grown-up versions of the kinds from 90210 no matter what your feelings about w lets hope this art does not imitate life<SEP>0
the poor dvd video quality is the only reason why i gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10 that could have been so much better this movie deserves itthis is truly a movie that covers several themes simultaneously if you do not like movies about serial killers but are fascinated by the astonishing bureaucratic culture in the former sovjet union this movie is a must-see anywayi cant compare it to silence of the lambs for several reasons the way the serial killer is portrayed has been done far much better in citizen x you see several details of his private life because you travel along with the killer which gives you some idea of the source of his constant anger and sexual frustrationthe only other movie i have seen that is as realistic as this one was henry - portrait of a serial killer if you were fascinated by that movie you definitely need to take a look at citizen x<SEP>1
gojoe is part of a new wave of japanese cinema taking very creative directors editors and photographers and working on historic themes what the japanese call period pieces gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color photography and editing brilliant even the new wave of japanese samurai films allows a peek at traditional beliefs in shamanism demons and occult powers that were certainly a part of their ancient culture but not really explored in kurosawas samurai epics or the zaitochi series another fine example of this genre is onmyoji 2001 i would place director sogo ichii as one of the most interesting and creative of the new wave japanese directors other recent japanese period pieces i would highly recommend include yomadas twilight samurai 2002 and shintaro katsus zatoichi: the blind swordsman 2003<SEP>1
after seeing the credits with only one name that i recognize and that was the preacher in this film russ conway i did not expect much from this film and i was not disappointed a man is planning on killing his new wife by convincing other people that she is insane and will take her own life unbeknown to the husband is that the plastic looking skull that he uses in contrast a ghost of a woman apparently his first dead wife has revenge on her mind and uses a real skull a simple plot with a twist of irony at the end if you are tired late one night and in need of sleep this will help you to sleep that sleep<SEP>0
a terrorist attempts to steal a top secret biological weapon and in the process of trying to escape he is infected when the case containing the deadly agent is compromised soldiers are able to retrieve the case but the terrorist makes his way to a hotel where he attempts to hide out they eventually make it to where hes hiding and cleanse the hotel and its occupants unfortunately they dispose of his body by cremation and if youve seen return of the living dead you know what happens nextzombi 3 has been widely panned by critics and zombie fans alike as a complete mess of a movie while thats a fair assessment its not without its high points for one thing it has plenty of bloody deaths to keep gore-hounds happy theres an abundance of zombies that seem to come out from everywhere possible theyre in the water the rafters of houses hiding in trees and for some reason they like to hide under a bunch of dead brush only to spring out to attack as the heroes try to escape theres even a flying zombie head that hides inside a refrigerator you have to see it to believe it as that scene alone makes zombi 3 required viewing imo it may have some terrible editing and some very questionable acting especially from the doctor who has to be one of the worst actors ive seen but zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie sometimes its nice to sit back and watch a movie that doesnt require anything more than your time and an open mind zombi 3 fits that bill and then some its even more enjoyable if you pop open a few beers and watch it with some like minded friends i give it an 810 just because of sheer enjoyment<SEP>1
this is the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen quite a few movies it is passed off as an art film but it is really a piece of trash its one redeeming quality is the beautiful tango dancing but that cannot make up for sally potters disgustingly obvious tribute to herself the plot of this movie is nonexistent and i guarantee you will start laughing by the end especially where she starts singing its absolutely unreal<SEP>0
the sexploitation movie era of the late sixties and early seventies began with the allowance of gratuitous nudity in mainstream films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn its peak years were between 1968 and 1972 one of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was monica gayle who had a small but fanatic cult of followers she was actually able to act unlike many who filled the lead roles of these flicks and her subsequent credits proved it and her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career was taking off only heightens her mystiquegary graver the director was also a talent; probably too talented for the sexploitation genre and his skill combined with monica gayles screen presence makes sandra the making of a woman a pleasantly enjoyable experience the film never drags and you wont have your finger pressed on the fast-forward button<SEP>1
this was my first and probably the last angelopoulos movie i was eager to get into it as it featured mastroianni one of my favorite actors and was a film by theo of whom ive heard a lot the opening was promising a long shot over a jeep of soldiers across the albanian-greek border ok! but that was all nothing left the movie had big holes and i dont know which to mention first the main plot of the story is revealed to the journalist by the old woman during a long walk its like a 15 minutes monologue killing the action and viewers patience nothing happening on screen for 15 or even 20 minutes apart this old lady telling a story all that is presumed to be shown through action was simply told to the camera by the old lady in a moment the equippe of tv was heading to the bar they turn the corner and immediately the winter begins! probably shot in different days continuity leaked a lot of problems with the story-telling it went from absurd to irrational never sticking to a style making the viewer asking questions that never got answers poor mastroianni given a role which lacked integrity or charm on the other hand as many greeks or albanians or balcan people would agree with the movies showed lot of historic ethnic or politically incorrectness just for the sake of making a movie about humanity as a red in another review a lot more to say but no time to lose on a poor movie which was not movie at all but lunacies of a person impressed on film and paid with state money<SEP>0
this spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen it shows a china i had never seen or imagined and i believe it shows 1930s china in the most real light ever seen in a movie it is absolutely heart-breaking in so many situations seeing how hard life was for the characters and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful you truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film the actors are all perfect such that you feel like you have really entered a different world i simply can not recommend this movie highly enough it may just change you forever once you have seen it<SEP>1
dont get me wrong im a huge fan of many of woodys movies obviously his late 70s masterpieces annie hallinteriors manhattanand most of his late 80searly 90s dramas hannah crimes and misdemeanershusbands and wives in fact i even liked some of his more recent efforts melinda anything else small time crooks but this was abysmal i though it couldnt possibly be any worse than last years match point but how wrong i wasit was lazily plotted - basically a cross between match point manhattan murder mystery and small time crookswith all the jokes taken out - woody seems to be on the way out as well slurring most of his lines and delivering hilarious catchphrases i mean that with all due respect over and over until the blandness of it all becomes to much to barei know that most actors are queuing up to work with him but they should at least read the script first - scarlett johansson and hugh jackman are so much better than this - and woody should really take a more behind the camera role in future if he has any sense about 20 miles behind itit wouldnt be so tragic if we didnt have so many great woody films to compare this to - but it is clear that his best days are behind him and judging by this effort woody should call it a day before he becomes an industry jokeembarrassingly bad<SEP>0
well let me say that i have always been a steven seagal fan and his movies are usually great but this just dont measure up to the rest this in my opinion is very stupid i did not like it all the biggest reason i dont like it is because it is very flawed and to me does not make much sense the acting is very bad even steven seagal does not do good acting the rest of the actors i can see because they just do direct to video movies it does not follow a straight storyline everything happens at once so that why it doesnt make much sense ther is barely any action in it at all and in order to make an action movie good you usually need action in it the special effects are very bad and you can tell are fake so all in all this has to seagals worst movie of all so if you want to see a steven seagal movie dont rent this one just pretend it does not exist so just avoid this movieoverall score: ** out of ********** * out of *****<SEP>0
this flick was a blow to me i guess little girls should aspire to be nothing more than swimsuit models home makers or mistresses since that seems to be all theyll ever be portrayed as anyway it is truly saddening to see an artists work and life being so unjustly misinterpretated inconcievably or perhaps it should have been expected artemisias entire character and all that she stands for had been reduced to a standard hollywood female character; a pitiful physically flawless helpless little creature displaying none of the character traits that actually got her that place in history which was being mutilated here sadder yet was to see that a great part of the audience was too badly educated in the area to comprehend the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film and reality to portray the artist as someone in love with her real-life rapist someone whom she in reality accused of raping her even when under torture just plain pisses me off if the director had nothing more substantial to say she should have refrained from basing her story on a real person<SEP>0
in one instant when it seemed to be getting interesting it never got therethe people are going from one point to another point with really no point if there was one it was very dull there was no action suspense or any horror and the characters were pretty heartless so there was no caring what happened to themall together the movie was pretty boringi give it a 310i like that it wasnt shaky choppy camera-work and if there was music it didnt annoy me like some really bad movies and the acting was not horrendous<SEP>0
it really impresses me that it got made the directorwriteractor must be really charismatic in reality i can think of no other way itd pass script stage what i want you to consider is thiswhile watching the films i was feeling sorry for the actors it felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there not enjoying it just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying id really like to know what the budget is guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor i want to write the jokes didnt appeal to me but the reality is for them to appeal to you youd have to be the man who wrote them or a retard so imagine that in script formand this guy got that green lit thats impressive isnt it<SEP>0
when i read most of the other comments i felt they were way too glowing for this movie i found it had completely lost the spark found in the earlier zatoichi movies and just goes to prove that after a long absence from the screen its often best to just let things be i completely agreed with the star trek analogy from another reviewer who compared the first star trek movie to the original series---millions of excited fans were waiting and waiting and waiting for the return of the show and were forced to watch a bland and sterile approximation of the originalthe plot is at times incomprehensible it is terribly gory though the recent new zatoichi by beat takeshi is much bloodier and lacks the heart of the originals i didnt mind the blood at all but some may be turned off by it particularly the scenes with the severed nose and the severed heads in addition time has not been good to ichi--he seems a broken and sad man in this film much much more than usual--and thats something fans of the series may not really want to seethis was a very sorry return for zatoichi unless you are like me and want to see every zatoichi film this one is very skipable see one of the earlier versions or the 2003 all-new version<SEP>0
while not as bad as his game-to-movie adaptations this hunk of crud doesnt fare much betterboll seems to have a pathological inability to accept that he doesnt make good movies one of these days hell run out of money and stop inflicting the world with his bombsthe acting was sub-par the dialog sounded like they were reading teleprompters and bolls special little touches were seen throughout the whole thinglike all uwe boll movies this one just shouldnt existplain and simplejust like uwe boll himself shouldnt exist >_><SEP>0
i know some people think the movie is boring but i disagree it is a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person i liked the characters in the film and think that leaving parts of archies life a mystery captured his humanity i dont think the purpose of a good biography should be the detailing of someones life but rather the complexities and relationships that make them interesting and what is more fascinating than someone so successfully reinventing themselves men become what they dream - you have dreamed well good job to lord attenborough i also wanted to mention that nathaniel arcand really stood out to me as a charismatic actor and i hope to see him in more films<SEP>1
whats with all the negative comments after having seen this film for the first time tonight i can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely persons day when i saw that drew ben affleck might end up spending the holidays alone i wanted to cry youll have to see the movie if you want to know why also even though i liked tom james gandolfini and alicia christina applegate after awhile if you ask me they were real snobs however this film did make me smile and feel good inside before i wrap this up id like to say that mike mitchell has scored a pure holiday hit now in conclusion i highly recommend this good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely persons day to any ben affleck or christina applegate fan who hasnt seen it<SEP>1
outrageously trashy karatehorror thriller with loads of graphically gory violence and gratuitous nudity and a thoroughly preposterous and bizarre plot this is lowbrow and low-grade entertainment that will appeal only to viewers with particularly kinky tastes but its kind of cheerfully bad and i must admit that i wasnt actually bored while watching it *12<SEP>0
fever pitch is a sweet and charming addition to the small genre of sports romances as date movies or movies a son could be willing to go to with his mother though the guys in the audience got noticeably restless during the romantic scenesi have lived through a milder version of such a story as my first exposure to baseball was dating my husband the spring after the mets first world series win and then i watched the mets clinch their next one because i was the one still up in the wee hours with our two little sons who have grown up to teach me more about baseball through our local neighborhood national league teams other heartbreaking failures to win it again and it was me who took our older son to his only fenway park game as i caught a bit of red sox fever as a graduate student in bostonso compared to reality the script believably creates two people with actual jobs it is particularly impressive that drew barrymores character is a substantive workaholic who has anti-barbie skills though she pretty much only visits with her three bland girlfriends during gym workouts that allow for much jiggling and the minor side stories with her parents dont completely workit is even set up credibly how she meets jimmy fallons math teacher and how she falls for his winter guy -- though its surprising that his red sox paraphernalia filled apartment didnt tip her off to his jekyll-and-hyde summer guy their relationship crisis during the baseball season is also played out in a refreshingly grown-up way from efforts at compromise to her frank challenges to him centered around that they are both facing thirty and single fallon surprisingly rises to his characters gradual emotional maturitywhile the ending borrows heavily from o henry the script writers did a yeoman job of quickly incorporating the soxs incredible 2004 season into a revised story line with lots of cooperation from the red sox organization for filming at the stadiumthe script goes out of its way to explain why fallon doesnt have a boston accent as an immigrant from new jersey but that doesnt explain why his motley friends dont the most authentic sounding boston sounds come from most of his summer family of other season ticket holders who kindly kibitz the basics of sox lore to neophyte barrymore and any such audience membersthe song selection includes many red sox fans favorites from the opening notes of the classic dirty water though most are held to be heard over the closing credits as if you are listening to local radio and are worth sitting through to hear<SEP>1
i have not yet decided whether this will replace anaconda as the worst film i have ever seeneven if you ignore the dodgy accents low production values and appalling camera work this film has absolutely nothing going for it i only went to see it as i had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot into a 2 hour filmthe simple answer is - they didnt characters appear with little to no explanation as to who they are and then proceed to play no valuable part in the narrative even the main characters act without reason so that by the time the film reaches its climax you dont care what happens to any of themi can accept that books occasionally need to be rewritten to fit into films and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this film against the book it was adapted from but after my friends and i came out of the cinema i had to spend most of the journey home explaining what was supposed to have happenedthey even change the true meaning of the books title rancid aluminium by squeezing it into yet another piece of pointless voice over just so they can allow the film to have a cool titlea real mess of a film from start to finish<SEP>0
this movie was bizarre completely inexplicable and hysterical to watch with friends while drinking in a big empty house i really love the opening stuff with lisa wandering about lost in a gorgeous city i want to be a beautiful stranger lost in some exotic european locale though maybe not in a low budget horror flick definitely get the ending where there are the strangely non-sexual sex scenes that were cut out in my dvd copy anyway dont attempt to understand it just go along and watch out for the weird bitswhich is everything dont watch this if you actually want plot or characterization or anything at all to make sense pretty beautiful though you may just give up on this and decide to watch an actual horror movie like say dead alive<SEP>0
this movie was a fairly entertaining comedy about murphys law being applied to home ownership and construction if a film like this was being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional since it was set in the simpler forties we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era grant of course perfectly blends the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by loy and douglas their shenanigans make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment 710<SEP>1
the ending of this movie made absolutely no sense what a waste of 2 perfectly good hours if you can explain it to meplease do i dont usually consider myself unable to get a movie but this was a classic example for me so either im slower than i think or this was a really bad movie<SEP>0

i think i usually approach film festival comedies with the low expectation that they will invariably be quirky and that any intended humor will be derived solely at the expense of the characters simplicity in the face of a complicated context what was exceptional about big bad swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his film while still finding laugh-out-loud humor in scene after scene there was a sophistication maybe due also in part to the sharp work of the dp ive rarely seen in an indie film and even more rarely in a comedy of special note here: paget brewsters turn as amy the math teacher after seeing this performance i cannot understand why brewster hasnt been discovered by a larger audience she brings the necessary mix of anger and likability to the role that really helps this picture reach its potential this is a terrific work deserving of a larger audience i look forward to more from the director and this cast!<SEP>1

i had seen lady with red hair back when it appeared and didnt remember it as something to cherish the truth is that notwithstanding its base in a true story its screen play is silly and unbelievable the real merit of the picture is the cast a constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 30s and 40s make a background for the delicate intelligent work of the always underrated miriam hopkins and the wonderful spectacular performance of claude rains who as usual is the best thing in the picture what an actor! he never won an oscar but he is in the good company of chaplin garbo and hitchcock perhaps lady with red hair contains his best work in films see it and enjoy him<SEP>1

to be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes muslims use racial jokes on themselves but it is the exact opposite i realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a muslim uses s a word like this in real life it doesnt mean it is a terrorist thing it also shows how people give the muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad muslims out it doesnt mean we are all bad we just try to live 1 day at a time like how hard it was for amair to get on a plane and how he used words like blow up or yaser saying well blow away the competition and people took it the wrong way being a muslim i know that stuff like this dont usually happen but they do and many people think bad things about muslims or afghanistan or iraq its not right things are not like that people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act i am glad a show like this came on the air there are many shows that piotr muslim people as terroristsmany people do find them funny to my opioion it is ok to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair but it is done to often and really gives muslin people a bad name<SEP>0
it is a rare occasion when i want to see a movie again the amati girls is such a movie in old time movie theaters i would have stayed put for more showings was this story autobiographical for the writerdirector it has the aura of realitythe all star cast present their characters believably and with tenderness who would not want mercedes ruehl as an older sister i have loved her work since for roseannawith most movies one suspends belief because we know that it is the work of actors producers directors sound technicians etc it was hard to suspend such belief in the amati girls one feels such a part of this family! how i wanted to come to the defense of dolores when her family is stifling her emotional life and wanted to cheer lee grant as she levels criticism at cloris leachmans hair color the humor throughout is not belly laugh humor but instead has a feel-good quality that satisfies far more than pratfalls and suchthe love that is portrayed in this cinema family is to be emulated and cherishedit is no coincidence that the family name amati translated from the italian means the loved ones<SEP>1
i love b moviesbut come onthis wasnt even worth a gradethe ending was dumbbc there was no real ending!!!not to mention that it comes to life on its owni mean no lighting storm or crazy demonic powers slow as hell and then they just start killing off the characters one by one in like a 15 min time periodand i wont even start on the part of the thing killing the one guy without its headand then you dont even get to see what jigsaw even does with his so called new jigsaw puzzleunless you have nothing better to doid watch paint dry before id recommend this god-forsaken movie to anyone elseoh and to make it even better the other movie totem you can see the guy throwing the one creature in the basement scene from the windowthat was funny as hell and probably the only good part of watching that waste of film<SEP>0
so im looking to rent a dvd and i come across this movie called end game it stars james woods and cuba gooding jr and has the synopsis of a taught political thriller well worth a look then or so i thoughtboy was i wrongend game has just about the most ridiculous plot i have ever had the displeasure of enduring now being something of a whodunnit i cant really tear into it as i would like without ruining it for those who have yet to experience this monstrosity but questions such as why has heshethey done this and where on earth did they get the resources to pull this off are all too abundant following the films unintentionally hilarious conclusionas for the acting - you know those films where you can almost feel that an actors realised that theyve made a terrible mistake in signing on for a movie and this then shows in their performance this is one of those accompany this with a laughable script and seriously flawed irritating direction and you have the recipe for cinematic poisonof course this didnt make it to the cinema and for the same reason you should not allow it into your living room; it is appalling<SEP>0
although the word megalmania is used a lot to describe gene kelly and sometimes his dancing is way too stiff you have to admit the guy knows how to put on a show in american in paris he choreographs some outstanding numbers some which stall the plot but are nonetheless amazing to look at check out gene kellys getting out of bed routine for startersgene kelly stars as a gi who is based out of paris he stayed there to paint soon he is a rich womans gigolo but he really loves someone else! hoary story sure but the musical numbers save the show here! i really loved georges gu¨¦tarys voice work in this one his stairway to paradise and his duet with le gene on s wonderful is s marvelous oscar levant and leslie caron i can take or leave all in all a pretty good but not dynamite movie<SEP>1
walt disneys cinderella takes a story everybodys familiar with and embellishes it with humor and suspense while retaining the tales essential charm disneys artists provide the film with an appealing storybook look that emanates delectable fairy tale atmosphere it is beautifully if conventionally animated; the highlight being the captivating scene where the fairy godmother transforms a pumpkin into a majestic coach and cinderellas rags to a gorgeous gown mack david al hoffman and jerry livingston provide lovely songs like a dream is a wish your heart makes and bibbidi-bobbidi-boo that enhance both the scenario and the characterseven though cinderellas story is predictable it provides such thrilling melodrama that one shares the concerns and anxieties of the titular heroine and her animal friends both the wicked stepmother and her dreadful cat lucifer present a formidable menace that threatens the dreams and aspirations of cinderella and the mice it is this menace that provides the story with a strong conflict that holds the viewers interest the films suspense however is nicely balanced by a serene sweetness especially in the musical numbers it is in these segments that reveal the appealing personalities of cinderella and her friends moving the viewers to care for them overall walt disneys cinderella is wonderful family entertainment that has held up remarkably well after half a century<SEP>1

ive seen this film criticized with the statement if you can get past the moralizing that misses the point moralizing is in the conscience of the beholder as it were this is a decent film with a standard murder mystery but with a distinct twist that surfaces midway through the resolution leaves the viewer wondering what would i have done in this position and i have to believe thats exactly what the filmmaker intended to that end and to the end of entertaining the audience the film succeeds i also like the way that the violence is never on stage but just off camera we know what has just happened; its just not served up in front of us then rubbed in our faces as it would be today with contemporary blood and gore dressing besides the violence is not the point the point is the protagonists moral dilemma which is cleverly albeit disturbingly resolved<SEP>1
this is what i call a pre sci fi; sci fi movie it gets no better than lugosikarloff in this incredibly good mood type motion picture these two genuine artists are at their very best as is the story linekarloff does an amazing job as a scientist that sees himself caught in a vise of vanity pride and scientific competition i was caught up in the idea of watching a man as he drowns himself in the three previously mentioned concepts i was saddened and at the same time fascinated with the two stars as they do themselves in this is the sort of motion picture that begs for a remake this time put harrison ford in the karloff part and maybe kieffer sutherland as the bela lagosi role it might be possible to do it almost as goodthis is one of the very best that hollywood ever produced as i saidit gets no better no way<SEP>1
wow alot of reviews for the devils experiment are here wonderful my name is steve and i run unearthed films we just started releasing the guinea pig films on dvd for north america now before you ask why am i writing a review instead ask why some people bash it im writing this review because i love the guinea pig films why do i love em its because they go for the throat and they dont let go ive seen it all almost every horror film known to man argento fulci bava buttgereit from every underground cult sensation to every hollywood blockbuster ive seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the guinea pig films why because it doesnt try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the 1st place this review is for the devils experiment i find it devoid of story which is fine by me why do i watch horror films so i can see blood and gore and the torture of people the devils experiment not only delivers but thats all it is pure unadulterated violence yeah i like a story but sometimes i just want the gore and the devils experiment delivers ten fold why do people bash it cause they like a story so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story it make em feel better about themselves we all want blood and gore its just really hard to justify it if its not wrapped around a story the guinea pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been releasedim thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world maybe i shouldnt have written this review but then again maybe i should my view is biased cause were releasing them but then again its not ive always told people to find them and to watch them way before i started unearthed films sure its exploitive and over the top but isnt that why we watch horror films in the 1st place the devils experiment is not for everybody its for thrill seekers and gorehounds only if you think jason movies and freddy krueger movies are awesome then stick to those but if your on the next level and have seen it all then the devils experiment is for you there is a reason why they havent been released for over 17 years they are wrong disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom unless she is totally cool good luck enjoy and never stop living your life<SEP>1
i saw this series when i was a kid and loved the detail it went into and never forgot it i finally purchased the dvd collection and its just how i remembered this is just how a doco should be unbiased and factual the film footage is unbelievable and the interviews are fantastic the only other series that i have found equal to this is die deutschen panzeri only wish hollywood would sit down and watch this series then they might make some great war moviesnote band of brothers saving private ryan letters from iwo jima flags of our fathers and when trumpets fade are some id recommend<SEP>1
band camp was awful the naked mile was a little better and this third straight to dvd in the american pie franchise seems the same quality as the predecessor basically erik stifler john white split from his girlfriend after losing his virginity and now him and mike cooze coozeman jake siegel are joining eriks cousin dwight steve talley at college with the promise of many parties plenty of booze and enough hot chicks at the beta house they only have fifty listed tasks to carry out to become official privileged members but a threat comes into sight with the rivals gek geek house led by power-hungry nerd and sheep shagger edgar tyrone savage offering bigger and better than what beta have to settle it once and for all beta and gek go into battle with the banned for forty years greek games to beat each other in with the loser moving out the last champion of the games noah levenstein aka jims dad the only regular eugene levy runs the show which sees the people unhooking bras a gladiator duel floating on water catching a greased pig russian roulette in the mouth with cartridges of aged horse spunk wife carrying and drinking a full keg of alcohol with puking not disqualifying it all comes to the sudden death with a guy getting stripper lap dancing and they have to resist cumming beta house win when edgar cums with a girl dressed as a sheep on his lap also starring flubbers christopher mcdonald as mr stifler meghan heffern as ashley dan petronijevic as bull nic nac as bobby christine barger as margie italia ricci as laura johnson moshana halbert as sara coleman sarah power as denise andreja punkris as stacy and jordan prentice as rock the nudity amount is very slightly increased as is the grossness of the jokes and i could guess it being rated one star out of five but i like it adequate!<SEP>0
yes its over the top yes its a bit clichéd and yes constance marie is a total babe and worthy of seeing again and again! the jokes and gags might get old and repetitive after a while but the shows still fun to watch since its a family show the humour is toned down and the writers have incorporated family values and ideals in between the gagsgeorge lopez is funny dont take him seriously and the shows a winner im sure he didnt intend his character to be serious or a paragon of virtue his outbursts and shouts of glee are hilariousi do have to say that the one big dark bitter spot is benny i hate the characterso much so that anytime shes on for more than 30 seconds i mute the tv just so i dont have to hear her there is nothing funny about her dialogue or her jokes as a mother she has to be the worst out there and i am just shocked and surprised that george as the character would stand by such a deplorable person for so longeven so anytime i get ticked off at seeing benny i think to myself: seeing her is a lot better than having to watch the bill engvall show now theres a bad sitcom<SEP>1
to quote flik that was my reaction exactly: wowyoure perfect! this is the best movie! i think i can even say its become my favorite movie ever even wow i tell you what wow<SEP>1
sophmoric this film is but it is funny as all get out it shows the boys locker room mentality being played by the other side it is good to see such tides turned and how silly they are but thats probably not news to most women cause just ask one theyve heard em all beforewatch it with a small group or party of mixed gender and 973% of the room will laugh for 2 hours straight and the other 27%can you ever really please them<SEP>1
this movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in hollywood the fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business the idea that audiences paid to see this movie and like an idiot i rented the film is discouraging alsoobsessed teacher 3 years prior kills teenagers family because he wants her for no reason he kills the mother father and brother from the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction years later obsessed teacher breaks out of prison hmm--usual bad writing--no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a navy seal and can sneak around sniff out people and with a knife is super killer sure!!! now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason knifes bellhop for the fun of it and starts to hunt down the teenagers friends now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel---again it is stupid ever cop would know his face--but he walks right by them now he kills two cops outside teenagers house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriendthere is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage if any other profession put out work of this low quality they would be fired yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash<SEP>0
this is what i call a great movie it lives trough the fantastic actor skills and a simple but human story there are real characters which can be funny and dramatic but the main theme is very cruel like live isthe bus driver and his son are collecting people trough the country jugoslavia on their way to the capital belgrad the funny and cruel situations that happens on the way connect the people and the pigs that travel together watch it and you gonna remember it for life its filled with slavic humor and lifestyleand another reason for its magic : it is hard to get!!<SEP>1
lame lame lame!!! a 90-minute cringe-fest thats 89 minutes too long a setting ripe with atmosphere and possibility an abandoned convent is squandered by a stinker of a script filled with clunky witless dialogue thats straining oh-so-hard to be hip mostly its just embarrassing and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat a sample of this movies dialogue: after demonstrating her artillery fast dolly shot to a closeup of barbeaus vigilante character she: `any questions hyuck hyuck hyuck bad acting idiotic homophobic jokes and judging from the creature effects it looks like the directors watched `the evil dead way too many times i owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and subjecting them to ninety wasted minutes theyll never get back what a turd<SEP>0
there is no way to describe how really really really bad this movie is its a shame that i actually sat through this movie this very tiresome and predictable movie whats wrong with it acting: there is not one performance that is even remotely close to even being sub-par atleast they are all very pretty soundtrack songs: if we get orgy on the soundtrack then everyone will know that they are watching a horror film!; soundtrack score: okay but anyone with a keyboard can make an okay soundtrack these days dont even get me started on the what the hell moments here are a few: killer can move at the speed of light--door opens actress turns no one is there turns back there is something sitting in front of her; out of now where the killer shows up with a power drill a really big one! the filmmakers get points for at least plugging it in but can i really believe that the killer took the time to find the power outlet to plug it in i feel like one of the guards at the beginning of holy grail and want to say whered you get the power drill i could go on and on about how bad this film is but i only have 1000 words i will give this 2 out of ten stars one star for making me laugh and another star for all the cleavage seriously do not waste your time with this one<SEP>0
i almost made a fool of myself when i was going to start this review by saying this movie reminded me of billy elliot but then i looked up the resume of screenwriter lee hall only to find out that he was the guy who wrote billy elliot so its mr hall whos making a fool of himself not me am i being a bit cruel on him no because lee has something most other aspiring screenwriters from britain dont have - he has his foot in the door he has previously written a successful british movie that won awards and made money at the box office and what does he do next he gives the audience more of the same young jimmy spud lives on some kitchen sink estate he is bullied at school and no one loves him the only thing keeping him going is that he has aspirations to be a ballet dancer no actually he has aspirations to be an angel but considering his household he may as well be a ballet dancer he has a macho waster of a father who thinks ballet dancers are a bunch of poofs while his granddad says ballet dancers are as tough as any man you could meet i remember seeing the bolshoi ballet yup ballet is a main talking point on a run down british council estate those days - not come to think of it neither is left wing politics which seems to be the sole preserve of middle class do gooders who live in nice big houses so right away everything about this set up feels ridiculously false another major criticism is that this is a film that has no clue who its trying to appeal to i have often criticised channel 4 for broadcasting movies at totally inappropriate times the land that time forgot at 6 am for example but they showed this at 2 am and for once theyve got it spot on considering the story involves politics ballet dancing gawd i hate it lung cancer and poverty theres no way this can be deemed suitable for a family audience but since the main protagonist is an 11 year old child and features angels and ballet dancers dont blame me if i seem obsessed with the subject - there was no need to refer to them theres not much here for an intelligent adult audience either of course if lee hall had been told at the script development stage by the producers that he should write a story featuring a schoolboy and an angel and had flatly refused saying that he wanted to write about other themes and stories then i will apologise but throughout the movie you do get the feeling that once the film was completed it was going to be marketed to the exact same audience who enjoyed billy elliot<SEP>0
one question that must be asked immediately is: would this film have been made if the women in it were not the aunt and cousin of jacqueline lee bouvier kennedy onassisthe answer is: probably notbut thankfully they are or were the cousin and aunt of jackiethis documentary by the maysles brothers on the existence one could hardly call it a life of edith b beale jr and her daughter edith bouvier beale edie has the same appeal of a train wreck -- you dont want to look but you have tobig edith and little edie live in a once magnificent mansion in east hampton new york that is slowly decaying around them the once beautiful gardens are now a junglemagnificent oil painting lean against the wall with cat feces on the floor behind them and beautiful portraits of them as young women vie for space on the walls next to covers of old magazinesliving alone together for many years has broken down many barriers between the two women but erected othersclothing is seems to be optional edies favorite costume is a pair of shorts with panty hose pulled up over them and bits and pieces of cloth wrapped and pinned around her torso and headas edith says edie is still beautiful at 56 and indeed she is there are times when she is almost luminescent and both women show the beauty that once was therethere is a constant undercurrent of sexual tensiontheir eating habits are to be polite strange ice cream spread on crackers a dinner party for ediths birthday of wonder bread sandwiches served on fine china with plastic utensilstime is irrelevant in their world; as edie says i dont have any clockstheir relationships with men are oh-so-strangeedie feels like edith thwarted any of her attempts at happiness she says if you cant get a man to propose to you you might as well be dead to which edith replies ill take a dog any dayit is obvious that edith doesnt see her role in edies lack of male companionship early in the film she states france fell but edie didntsometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what is being said both women talk at the same time and constantly contradict each otherthere is a strange relationship with animals throughout the film; edie feeds the raccoons in the attic with wonder bread and cat food the cats and there are many of them are everywhereat one point edie declares the hallmark of aristocracy is responsibility but they seem to be unable to take responsibility for themselvesthis is a difficult film to watch but well worth the effort<SEP>1
since most reviews of this film are of screenings seen decades ago id like to add a more recent one the film opens with stock footage of b-17s bombing germany the film cuts to oskar werners hauptmann captain wust character and his aide running for cover while making their way to hitlers fuehrer bunker once inside they are debriefed by bunker staff personnel the film then cuts to one of many conference scenes with albin skoda giving a decent impression of adolf hitler rallying his officers to ultimate victory while werners character is shown as slowly coming to realize the bunker denizens are caught up in a fantasy world-some non-bunker events are depicted most notable being the flooding of the subway system to prevent a russian advance through them and a minor subplot involving a young member of the flak units and his familys difficulty in surviving-this film suffers from a number of detail inaccuracies that a german film made only 10 years after ww2 should not have included; the actor portraying goebbels willy krause wears the same uniform as hitler including arm eagle- goebbels wore a brown nazi party uniform with swastika armband-the ss soldiers wear german army camouflage the well documented scene of hitler awarding the iron cross to boys of the hitler youth is shown as having taken place inside the bunker it was done outside in the courtyard and lastly hitlers suicide weapon is clearly shown as a belgian browning model 1922-most accounts agree it was a walther ppk-some bits of acting also seem wholly inaccurate with the drunken dance scene near the end of the film being notable this bit is shown as a cabaret skit with a intoxicated wounded soldier his arm in a splint maniacally goose-stepping to music while a nurse does a combination stripteasebelly dance all by candlelight this is actually embarrassing to watch-the most incredible bit is when werners captain wust gains an audience alone with skodas hitler hitler is shown as slumped on a wall bench drugged and delirious when werners character begins to question him hitler starts screaming which brings in a ss guard who mortally wounds werners character in the back with a gunshot-this fabricated scene is not based on any true historic account-werners character is then hauled off to die in a anteroom while hitler prepares his own ending hitlers farewell to his staff is shown but the suicide is off-screen the final seconds of the movie show hitlers funeral pyre smoke slowly forming into a ghostly image of the face of the dead oskar wernerhauptmann wust-this film is more allegorical than historical and anyone interested in this period would do better to check out more recent films such as the 1973 remake hitler: the last 10 days or the german film downfall der untergang if they wish a more true accounting of this dramatic story these last two films are based on first person eyewitness accounts with hitler: the last 10 days being compiled from gerhard boldts autobiography as a staff officer in the fuehrer bunker and downfall being done from hitlers secretarys recollections the screen play for der letzte akte is taken from american nuremberg war crimes trial judge michael musmannos book ten days to die which is more a compilation of events many obviously fanciful than eyewitness history-it is surprising that hugh trevor ropers accountthe last days of hitler was never made into a film<SEP>0
i have seen a lot of movies in my life but not many as bad as this it is a movie that makes fun of fat people has no real story has bad actors is not funny and much more is this a movie that you would like to see i guess not!i guess that the makers of the movie was trying to be original and creative but it looks like it was made by a 12 year old child with absolutely no cinematic skills at all the so called funny parts is as funny as throughing pies in the faces of people or breaking wind of cource if this is the kind of humour that you like then this is the movie for you!!dont waste your money on this movie!<SEP>0
this has got to be the best movie ive ever seencombine breathtaking cinematography with stunning acting and a gripping plot and you have a masterpiecedog bite dog had me gripping the edge of my seat during some scenes recoiling in horror during others and left me drowning in my own tears after the tragic endingthe film left a deep impression on me its shockingly violent scenes contrasted sharply with the poignant and tender love scenes the film is undeserving of its cat iii nudity rating; there are no nude scenes whatsoever and the love scenes do not even involve kissing or making outthe message which this film presented to me all human beings no matter how violent or cruel they may seem have a tender side edison chen does a superb job playing the part of the murderous pangi rate this film 1010 its a must-watch<SEP>1
i am working my way through the chilling classics 50 movie pack collection and the witches mountain el monte de las brujasis something like the 17th movie in the setthe movie had nothing to it to hold my attention at all the plot was incoherent the dialog seemed improvised the acting was poor the characters were unsympatheticthe best scene is the beginning with an exasperated woman that is driven to burning her seemingly bratty daughter however the only connection this scene has to the rest of the movie is the lead character mario who has the most stupendous mustache ever but thats itthe film was not effective on any level the music was too intrusive the lighting was very dark so that some scenes are almost completely black it really is barely watchable -- what more can i say<SEP>0
as a big fan of gorilla movies in general i anticipated that this one would be great - and as for the gorilla effects they were quite good however - that is the only thing i can write about this flop the film claims to be based on a true story but in effect it does not even come close to what actually happened to buddy - who in real life was the famous gargantua sold to ringling bros by our supposed heroic gertrude lintz known by many animal enthusiasts as a woman who hardly had her animals welfare in the best interest as far as buddy being portrayed as becoming aggressive this was total fiction and at no time did the gorilla in real life resort to such behavior buddy did in fact escape his wooden crate not a plush cage room as depicted in movie during a storm to seek shelter and comfort in the house which frightened gertrude lintz into selling him no buddy was not released into a gorilla family surrounded by lush trees in a zoological paradise - he was abandoned in a wooden crate deep in the back of a garage for some time with only a single light bulb for comfort and then sold to the circus - where he actually lived a better life having peanuts thrown at him until he died historically the oldest living gorilla on record by the way before a show in miami notice also in the film how buddy grows older but the chimpanzees never age the chimps by the way were not raised simultaneously with other animals including buddy as portrayed in the film<SEP>0
i was literally preparing to hate this movie so believe me when i say this film is worth seeing overall the story and gags are contrived but the film has the charm and finesse to pull them off that gag where jason lee thinks he has crabs and tries not to let his bossfuture father-in-law and co-workers see him scratching himself isnt terribly intelligent but it sent me into a frenzy of laughter very few of the films gags are high-brow but they made me laugh as i said the film has charm and charm can go a long way the characters are likable too i must say i wish i got to see more of james brolins character since he was a hoot in the very few scenes he was in plus i admire any romantic comedy that has the guts to not make the character of the wife who serves as the obstacle in the plot a total witch the selma blair character is hardly unlikable and theres never a scene where i thought to myself why did he want to marry her in the first place the ending is hollywood-ish but it couldve been much more schmaltzy the cast is talented i havent had a favorable view of most of jason lees mainstream work i just loved him so much in kevin smiths films that i couldnt help but feel disappointed at seeing him in these dopey roles and he never looks comfortable in these dopey roles even in this movie he doesnt look perfectly comfortable but he contributes his own two cents and effectively handles each scene but i still miss his work in independent films julia stiles proves again why shes so damn likable of course shes a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint but she also possesses a unique charm and seems to have good personality in other words her beauty shows inside and out i dont know the actresses name but the woman who plays the drunk granny is hilarious julie hagerty also has a small part and shes always enjoyable to watch which makes me wish she received better roles i loved her so much in airplane and lost in america that its a shame she doesnt get the same opportunities to flaunt her skills dont be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office records this is a funny charming film romantic comedies are getting so predictable nowadays that it feels like the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet so its always to see a good one among all these bad apples my score: 7 out of 10<SEP>1
saw it as many times as i could before it left the scene a delightful and entertaining film with some of my very favorite stars only wish i could find it again! would certainly buyview it if i could please somebody bring it back fred macmurray was perfect in his role as a patriot during world war ii and his leading ladies joan leslie and especially june haver were beautiful and charming it was a musical but also romantic funny and clever this was my favorite movie starring june haver although i always liked her her dazzling smile lit up the screen and her beauty and talent were an asset to any film the supporting cast lent credit to their individual roles a well-balanced and light-hearted film; only wish we had more like it!<SEP>1
very disappointing film by the end i no longer cared for any of the characters i did enjoy seeing ving rhames in a very small part and william macy was good as always still not worth watching it starts out strong and just keeps getting weaker and weaker insomniacs will like it as i am sure it will put them to sleep<SEP>0
this was one of the most boring movies ive ever seen i dont really know why just your run-of-the-mill stories about guy who is about to get married and starts to fancy someone else instead story has been told a thousand times nothing new or innovative about it at alli dont really know what was wrong with this film most of the time when these kinds of actorsactresses get together to make a film that have already been made a million times before its really entertaining there are usually little clever thing in them that arent really in any other for some reason this one just doesnt hold your attention you can pick out some funny parts or clever ideas in it but for some reason theyre just not funny nor clever in any way i wish i new how to explain it but i dont just dont waste your time on this one<SEP>0
another horror flick in which a goof-ball teenager battles a madman and his supernatural sidekick who want to take over! yes but the fact that this one was from canada gives it a slightly different feel the brain has troublesome teenager jim majelewski getting put into a treatment whose leader turns out to be a cult leader aided by a big ugly brain can jim stop him i guess that since our northern neighbor has accomplished all that they have accomplished theyre entitled to make at least one ridiculous horror movie but still theyll probably want to be known for having national health care and allthe bad guy had a brain why didnt the people who made this movie<SEP>0
david duchovny and michelle forbes play a young journalist couple who want to go to california but cant really afford to so they ride share with another young couple brad pitt and juliette lewis to save on expenses the idea is for them to stop at various murder sites along the way sites where serial killers did their thing since brian duchovny is a writer and carrie forbes is his photographer what they dont know is that pitt earley and lewis are serial killer and girlfriend who just goes along with whatever he says i dont care for pitt as a rule but he does justice to psycho roles the scary thing is that he does them so well; ive actually known people like him before no not killers but with pretty much the same mindset anyway as the road trip goes along carrie guesses that the others are about out of money but earley seems to always come up with the cash somehownever mind that he leaves someone dead here and there to do it though lewis does her role well one that she excels at a not-too-bright waif that has a good heart but doesnt understand that she doesnt have to put up with being beaten up by earley when she does something he doesnt like as things begin to get more unacceptable carrie insists that the other couple be put out at a gas station and unfortunately its at that point where shes inside that she sees a news bulletin that tells her exactly who theyve been ride-sharing with after which things go downhill for them at a rapid clip this is not the greatest flick in the world but its not badi watched what was supposed to be the unrated version but i wonder how much was cut out of the rated version because this seemed fairly tame to me reallynot that this makes it family fare or anything unless its maybe the manson family 7 out of 10<SEP>1
any movie that portrays the hard-working responsible husband as the person who has to change because of bored cheating wife is an obvious result of 8 years of the clinton eraits little wonder that this movie was written by a woman<SEP>0
i work at a movie store and as such i am always on the look-out for an excellent movie i decided to check out nothing as it sat in our canadian section and ive been trying to support my countrys movie industry i was in for a surprise the film features david hewlett and andrew miller in a highly entertaining story that seems to delve into so much of our minds and relationshipswithout working that hard it is consistently comedic through the interaction of the two characters as well as some funny exchanges we cant be dead we have cable! what more can i say without noting that it is worth a shot even if you abandon it within the first half an hour<SEP>1
having not read the novel i cant tell how faithful this film is the story is typical mystery material: killer targets newlyweds; woman investigator falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a fatal disease yes it sounds like a soap opera and thats exactly how it plays the first 23 are dull save for the murders and the last 13 makes a partial comeback as it picks up speed toward its twisty conclusionacting is strictly sub par though its hard to blame the actors alone: the screenplay is atrocious during the last 13 you stop noticing because the film actually becomes interesting but thats only the last 13 director russell mulcahy is very much in his element but theres only so much he can do with a tv budget and the network censors on his back hes pretty much limited to quick cutting and distorted lenses though he managed to squeeze in a couple under the floor shots during the murders in the club restroom unfortunately as this is made for tv the cool compositional details he uses so well with a wider image are nowhere to be found note to producers: give this man a reasonable budget and an anamorphic lens when you hire himsumming it up: this film is bad by cinema standards and mediocre by tv standardswatch csi instead if youre in the mood for a film like this ive some excellent suggestions: pick up a copy of dario argentos deep redmy highest recommendation; superb film opera or even tenebre theyre stronger in every category<SEP>0
my first clue about how bad this was going to be was when the video case said it was from the people who brought us blair witch project which was a masterpiece in comparison to this piece of garbage the acting was on the caliber of a 6th grade production of oklahoma and the plot such as there was is predictable boring and inane 85% of the script is four letter words and innumerable variations on them mother f seems to be the writers favorite because it is used constantly it must have taken all of 10 minutes to write this script in some dive at last call thank god i rented it and could jump through most of it on fast forward dont waste your time or money with this<SEP>0
i wonder who was responsible for this mess the jokes wouldnt have worked for gilligans island if this had gone to series would there have been jokes about auschwitz or would eva have to replace her oven only to have adolf suggest the kind that seats 50 another post compared this show to i love lucy the problem with this is that lucille ball was a genius at physical comedy and bizarre situations and this mess was just plain badly done and an insult to my intelligence after the damage the nazis did to england and the number of people they killed i would think the very concept of a comedy about hitler would seem repugnant and most normal people would have killed this concept before any episodes were produced<SEP>0
its 1978 and yes obviously there are too many black players on the teams as well! fans will be upset and certainly the 75000 seats will be full only less happy there are so many black players on the field! this made for tv super bowl movie is watchable its not much more but its really surprising the cast of talented actors that make an appearance for the time probably most notably tom selleck unfortunately any goodness selleck brings to the screen is quickly trumped by actors like dick butkusits a silly story about super bowl betting pj jackson is charged by new york read mafia for ensuring the game ends for their favor in this case a $10000000 bet pj is innocent enough and seems to have a loose grasp by buying off a few people here and there but things seem to fall apart for him another person the unsuspected lainie takes charge for a while the mystery of murders isnt known for certain but is revealed rather plainly at the final murder that lainie is the new antagonistits a bad movie but is watchable the acting is decent and the filming is ok at least there werent any silly typical 70s car chases they have their place just not here just keep an open mind about past stereotyping and the cocaine era and youll survive210 maybe a 25<SEP>0
this is a great movie i did the play a while ago it had an extra zing-- to it i loved vanessa williams as rosey and also jason alexander has a good voice it was great the setting were also very good except the fact that it is 2 hours and 50 minutes makes it pretty long overall i give it 85 stars they also added a few parts but it was still cool<SEP>1
coming from the same director whod done candyman and immortal beloved im not surprised its a good film ironically papierhaus is a movie id never heard of until now yet it must be one of the best movies of the late 80s - partly because that is hands down the worst movie period in recent decades not talking about iranian or swedish cinema here the acting is not brilliant but merely solid - unlike what some people here claim they must have dreamt this wondrous acting much like anna the story is an interesting fantasy that doesnt end in a clever way that ties all the loose ends together neatly these unanswered questions are probably left there on purpose leaving it up to the individuals interpretation and theres nothing wrong with that with a theme such as this pepperhaus is a somewhat unusual mix of kids film and horror with effective use of sounds and music i like the fact that the central character is not your typical movie-cliché ultra-shy-but-secretly-brilliant social-outcast girl but a regular normal kid; very refreshing i am sick and tired of writers projecting their own misfit-like childhoods into their books and onto the screens as if anyone cares anymore to watch or read about yet another miserly lonely childhood as if thats all there is or as if that kind of character background holds a monopoly on good potential the scene with anna and the boy snogging for quite a stretch was a bit much - evoking feelings of both vague disgust and amusement - considering that she was supposed to be only 11 but predictably it turned out that burke was 13 or 14 when this was filmed i have no idea why they didnt upgrade the characters age or get a younger actress it was quite obvious that burke isnt that young why directors always cast kids older than what they play hence dilute the realism ill never know<SEP>1
this ranks as one of the worst movies ive seen in years besides cuba and angie the acting is actually embarrassing wasnt archer once a decent actress what happened to her the action is decent but completely implausible the make up is so bad its worth mentioning i mean who ever even thinks about the makeup in a contemporary feature film someone should tell the make up artist and the dop that youre not supposed to actually see it the ending is a massive disappointment - along the lines of and then they realized it was all a dreamdont waste your time or your money youre better off just staring into space for 2 hours<SEP>0
my son was 7 years old when he saw this movie he is now on a russian fishing vessel and said that the movie he was most impressed with and that has lingered in his mind all of these 39 years is the movie of the legend of the boy and the eagle he has asked if it were possible for me to get this for him i am sure that a lot of things go through his head as he has only 3 hours of daylight and he has been on this ship for 3 months and will have 3 more months before his contract expires since we have indian blood he connects to this movie on january 27th he will turn 47 years old and i would like to be able to obtain this movie for him he lives in thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous jobs can you help me obtain this movie thanking you in advance dolly crout-soto deerfield beach fl<SEP>1

ah domino is actually a breath of fresh air something new to the cinema world i enjoyed the movie a lot because of the intricate plot the varied characters and the intense camera effects ive seen some complain about the camera work and in fact according to the creators themselves the flashy and wild shots were all the culmination of mistakes made through time all of what you see was the desired effect perhaps some complain because something quite like this has never been done before although thats what sets it apart in a deeper aspect what you are seeing is just how domino sees things through her eyes think about itwhen it comes to the story i dont see anything quite bad about it despite its messy nature according to some it is in fact just a rapid form of storytelling the plot really isnt all that hard to follow if you actually focus on whats going on maybe its just me because i see movies from many different aspects such as the acting the plot etc im no interpreter or anything who picks movies apart it just comes to me with that said i believe this is quite an excellent movie indeed despite its future as a cult-classic blockbuster or whateverand the characters well theres no doubting how varied the cast is i believe the cast is excellent as they all do fine jobs portraying their characters effectively thats what makes a movie ladies and gentlemen the characters are all very unique and a plus is that you get to witness a small piece of each one of their lives setting them apart even further basically i personally loved the cast and charactersall those who bash and burn this film perhaps just dont see it as i do or it just doesnt appeal to them no matter this is a great film in its own right no its a great film period<SEP>1
i can always tell when something is going to be a hit i see it or hear it and get a good feeling i did not get a good feeling watching the preview i was not at all enthusiastic about this film and i am not at all surprised that it is rated here as one of the worst 100 films i was in fact proved rightthe first thing that threw me off was the title not that i have a problem with ebonicsi am black by the way but for a movie they could have used a better title and for this time use a title that doesnt have bad grammar i heard the dialog saw the acting and all i could do was make facesi also think that the dance movie theme is being overdone at least you got served was better than this in my opinion even the soundtrack didnt thrill me<SEP>0
this is the kind of picture john lassiter would be making today if it werent for advances in cgi and thats just to say that hed be forgotten too if technology hadnt made things sexy and kewl since 1983 _twice_ has got the same wit imagination and sense of real excitement that youd find in a pixar flick only executed under the restrictions of the medium c 1983 innovative animation techniques combine with a great script and excellent voicing to produce a movie that appeals on lots of levels it should be spoken of in the same breath with _spiritited away_ and _toy story_<SEP>1
an excellent cast makes this movie work; all of the characters are developed exceedingly well and its clear that the actors enjoyed filming this movieits not quite the comedy i expected much more a lighthearted look at the attempt to reclaim youthful glory than bawdy humor for music fans there are quite a few subtle references that in themselves are intelligently funnyi hate drawing direct comparisons to other movies but so much of this movie reminded me of alan parker films i cant help it: imagine if the commitments actually did make it big -- and then tried to recapture said glory 25 years later<SEP>1
i love killer insects movies they are great fun to watch i had to watch this movie as it was one of my favourite horror books by shaun hutsoni have met him and i wish i did listen to him as this movie was terrible like he said it wasafter he said that i was still dying to see how bad it wasthe plot: people are dying mysteriously and gruesomely and nobody has a clue what the cause isonly health worker mike brady has a possible solution but his theory of killer slugs is laughed at by the authoritiesonly when the body count begins to rise and a slug expert from england begins snooping around does it begin to look like mike had the right idea after allthis movie as the most overacting you ever see a movie! slugs in this movie are fast then normal and it looks like they fast forwarding the scenes! this movie is nothing like the book at all the book was ten times scarier ten times gory and had a lot more story to it!i didnt like this movie at all! as i am huge fan of slugs the book and second book called breeding ground! both of books are great read the book then watch the movie you may like more then i did give this 2 out 10<SEP>0
ive seen some crappy movies in my life but this one must be among the very worst definately bottom 100 material imo that iswe follow two couples the dodds billy bob thornton as lonnie earl and natasha richardson as darlene and the kirkendalls patrick swayze as roy and charlize theron as candy in one car on a roadtrip to renoapparently lonnie isnt too happy with his sex-life so he cheats on his wife with candy whos despirately trying to have a baby roy meanwhile isnt too sure if his sperm is ok so hes getting it checked by a doctornow i had read the back of the dvd but my girlfriend didnt and she blurted out after about 20 minutes: oh yeah shes gonna end up pregnant but her husband cant have any babys spot on as this movie is soooo predictable as well as boring and annoying meaningless offensive terriblean example of how much this movie stinks the two couples set out in their big car towards nevada when they are stopped by 2 police-officers as they didnt stop at a stop-sign the guys know each other and finally bribe the two officers with a case of beer not only is this scene pointless and not important or even relevant for the movie it takes about 5 minutes! its just talk and talk and talk without ever going somewherei still have to puke thinking about the ending though apparently roy isnt having problems down there so he is the father of the child how many times does that happen in the movies try something new! the cheated wife ultimately forgives her husband and best friend for having the affair and they all live happily ever after yuckbest scene of the movie is right at the end with a couple of shots of the grand canyon why couldnt they just keep the camera on that for 90 minutesone would expect more from this cast although thornton really tries but you cant really blame them writers shame on you!110<SEP>0
for anthony mann the western was legend- and legend makes the very best cinema! manns work was full of intensities and passions visually dramatic and the action always excitingly photographedstewart a docile actor with the ability of displaying anger neurosis and cruelty made with anthony mann five remarkable westerns: winchester 73; bend of the river; the naked spur; the far country; and the man from laramiein winchester 73 stewart reveals his darker side he offers all the reserves of anger inner ambivalence and emotional complexity in his nature that his audiences had up till this time failed to catcha carefully chosen cast increases the proceedings in fine style: shelley winters is at her saucy best; dan duryea perfect as the vicious sneering psychopathic villain; john mcintire great as the unscrupulous character; charles drake so good as the man who attempts to face his tormentor; and a very young rock hudson attempts the role of an indian chief winchester 73 is the story of a perfectly crafted and highly prized rifle in the dodge city kansas of 1876 stewart and his estranged brother who bears another name stephen mcnally compete fiercely for possession of it and though stewart wins mcnally steals it and sets off cross-country with stewart in pursuit what gives the pursuit an element of the demonic is stewarts determination to revenge his fathers death at the hands of that same renegade brothera revenge fed by long-standing fratricidal hatredphotographed in gorgeous black & white the film comes on as powerful and arresting acted with deep feeling and intense concentration not only by stewart but by all the supporting characterslook fast for a promising newcomer tony curtis the soldier who finds the rifle after the indian attack<SEP>1
this is very much not the sort of movie for which john wayne is known he plays a diplomat a man who gets things done through words and persuasion rather than physical action the film moves with a quiet realism through its superficially unexciting storyfor the open-minded the patient and the thoughtful this movie is a rich depiction of an intriguing part of historythere are two intertwining stories the big story is of internalised isolationist japan and externalised expansionist america clashing when their interests conflict the small human story is of an outsider barbarian wayne and a civilised geishas initial hostility and dislike turning to mutual respect and love the human story is a reflection of the greater story of the two nationsthe movie is very well done and all actors play their roles well the two lead roles are performed to perfection john wayne is excellent as townsend harris striking exactly the right blend of force and negotiation in his dealings with the japanese eiko ando is likewise excellent as the geisha of the title charming and delightful the interaction between her character and john waynes is particularly well portrayed this is exactly how these two individuals as they are depicted in the film would have behavedthe script is very well written it lacks all pomposity and is a realistic depiction of the manner in which the depicted events may have occurred the characters are real people not self-consciously great figures from history furthermore the clash of cultures and interests is portrayed with great skill and subtlety indeed the clash of a traditionalist and traditionally powerful isolationist japan and a rising newly powerful nation from across the ocean is summarised very well in one exchange between john wayne and the local japanese baron wayne complains that shipwrecked sailors are beheaded if they land in japan and that passing ships cannot even put into port for water the baron responds that japan just wants to be left alone waynes character replies that japan is at an increasingly important crossroads of international shipping and that if things continue as before the nation will be regarded as nothing more than a band of brigands infesting an important roadway a very real summary of the way in which the two countries each saw themselves as being in the right and saw the other as being in the wrong the resultant clash between two self-righteous peoples with conflicting interests has its reflections throughout history a continuing theme that echoes into the present and on into the futurecinematography and the depiction of mid-nineteenth century japan before the accelerated growth towards industrialisation that was to follow later in the century is excellent a visual treat and an enlightening insight into japans ancient civilisationi highly recommend anyone whether a john wayne fan or not to watch this film if you get the chance just be aware that it isnt an action film it is a representation of an interesting place and time in history and a slow-boiling love story which much to their surprise comes to dominate the personal lives of the two main characters watch this film on its merits without preconceptions allow yourself to be immersed in its story and you will thoroughly enjoy itall in all an excellent film<SEP>1

i could not take my eyes off this movie when it showed up on cable the dialogue and costumes are of a quality most readily associated with soft-core porn in this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchuks perhaps for sex as well but not on indian tv anywaynot being a fan of the genre i couldnt place jeff wincott and had no leads to search from only once brigitte nielsen traded in her futuristic-nurse coif so mayoral! for the high-top fade we remember from beverly hills cop ii did i make the positive id on herthis movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of early 90s couture or nod-and-wink schlock à la paul verhoeven can we add a genre tag for so-bad-its-good<SEP>1
there are so many puns to play on the title of the spectacularly bad valentine that i dont know where to begin i will say this though; here is a movie that makes me long for the complexity of the valentine cards we used to give out in elementary school you know the ones with batman exclaiming youre a super crime-fighting valentine!valentine is a slasher movie without the slightest hint of irony one of the few horror movies in recent years that ignores the influence of scream the villain is omniscient and nigh-invulnerable the heroes are easily scared when people run around corners and grab them by the shoulders screaming heyijustleftmycoatbehind! the score is more overbearing than norman bates motherthe flimsy plot follows several childhood friends now grown up and extremely curvaceous since the film gives them nothing else to do they stand around and wait until a masked stalker kills them one by one this stalker appears to be former nerd jeremy melton who was constantly rejected by women and beaten by men in high school with valentines day approaching the women begin receiving scary cards foretelling their doom melton seems like the obvious suspect only problem is as numerous characters warns in thirteen years melton could have changed his appearance to look buff and handsome so insert terrified gasp here everyone is a suspect!heres problem one in order to have any sense of suspense while watching valentine you have to accept a reality in which a high school nerd is capable of becoming david boreanaz nerds dont turn into angel when they grown up they turn into older balder nerds hes not a terrible actor but the script by no less than four writers gives him and the rest of the cast nothing to do but scream and make out denise richards the bustiest actress in hollywood never to star in baywatch is especially exploited; most shamefully in the blatant excuse to get her in a bathing suit just before a crucial suspense scene note to self: always bring a bathing suit to a valentines day party just because its february doesnt mean you might not feel like taking a little dipthe slasher in valentine dresses in head-to-toe black with a cherubs mask heres problem number two the filmmakers clearly thought this would be a disturbing image to have on the head of someone whos whacking people in the face with hot irons plain and simple its not instead it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers his entire face including his eyes and ears can move so stealthily without bumping his shins on chairs or tables then again given the things the cupid killer does maybe he can teleport and his eyes are on his hands not only is the movie bad it isnt even sure who the killer is; the final twist is more huh than hah! when youre not scratching your head youre yawning then groaning then searching for the nearest exit do not watch this movie even if youre alone on valentines day find something anything else to do youll be glad you did<SEP>0
ive seen better production quality on youtube! i pity the actors as the writing was terrible and the direction shocking not sure how they could get the lines out - i really doubt any actor would have been able to salvage this movie no matter how good they were the characters were not developed at all and there was no real cohesion in the plot which just seemed to go nowhere much its a shame really as the premise for the movie was good and with better production quality direction and script it could have been a decent movie it certainly was not a comedy unless you laugh out loud at the dubbing - which was amateurish even the english actors sounded weird<SEP>0
look although we dont like to admit it weve all have to suppress our fears concerning the extreme likelihood of experiencing the events that take place in this movie you know: you get into your car and you immediately start thinkinggosh i hope today isnt the day that my accelerator sticks at a comfortable cruising speed of 55 mph all four door latches break in the locked position both my main and emergency brake fail my ignition switch cant be turned off and ive got a full tank of gas; all simultaneously fortunately for most of us our thorazine kicks-in before we actually decide that its a bad idea to be driving a car not so for the makers of the harrowing white-knuckle edge-of-your-seat if only in preparation to leave the room action juggernaut runaway car but they go ahead and drive anyway!i am endlessly pleased to have found thanks to the imdb that this movie is real and that i didnt merely dream itthis movie is at the very least one of the fantastic sights you will see on your journey to find the el dorado of very bad cinemai highly recommend it<SEP>1
for those who like depressing films with sleazy characters and a sordid storyline this one is for you! from the bleak new york city atmosphere which comes across as an extremely grim and almost hopeless place to two diverse lead characters devoid of much sense of morality this movie is a real downer why it won the academy award was because it was so shocking at that time that hollywood brand new its freedom to show anything it wanted with all moral codes abandoned wanted to celebrate that fact filmmakers then were like an immature six-year-old with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store so hollywood gave theater viewers for probably the first time a dose of rape prostitution homosexuality child nudity homeless existence and other such wonderful sights and sounds only its twisted brain would think is appealingand then awarded its work it also hoped im sure to shock mainstream audiences well it succeeded on that level audiences were stunned at what they say and heard and the academy proud of itself for being able to display filth and make money at the same time couldnt help but bestow honors upon this piece of gilded garbageforty years ago as a very young man i found this film fascinating too however seeing it again in the 1990s left such a bad taste in my mouth i never watched to view it again the acting was good but so what acting is good in many films nobody ever said dustin hoffman and jon voight couldnt act hoffman was particularly good in his younger days in playing wacked-out people he was kind of like the johnny depp of his era playing guys like ratso rizzo in this film and then going to be the rain man later on yes ratso is a character youll never forget and joe buck voight is one you want to forget but the story is so sordid it overwhelms the fine actingthis movie isnt art and it isnt worthy of its many awards; it only pushed the envelope big-time in 1969 and thats why it is so fondly remembered in the hearts of film people and critics its two hours of profanity and ultra-sleazy religious cheap shots glorifying weirdos andy warhol even gets in the act - no surprise and generally despicable peoplei did like the catchy song everybodys talking that helped make harry nilsson famous but even that was bogus because fred neil wrote the song and sang it better before nilsson did itand few people have ever heard of neil which is their loss and - as mentioned - the name ratso rizzo kind of stays with you!the film is a landmark but in a negative sense i fear: this marked it as official that hollywood had gone down the toilet and it has remained in the sewer ever since<SEP>0
ever wonder where the ideas for romance novels and other paper back released come from according to jake speed they are based on real people living out the adventures they write about and publish this movie is quality family entertainment moderate amounts of violence and skimpy clothes at the worst the language is is also not a problem and the jokes are funny at all levels this is a austin powers look at indian jones without the over-the-top antics of michael myers i highly recommend this film for kids in the 10 to 15 range<SEP>1
this is a superbly imaginative low budget sci-fi movie from cult director vincenzo natali the film plays out like a crossing of phillip k dick with hitchcock and cronenberg and the film takes on a unique feel like nothing you would have seen the film is superbly shot i love the cinematography in this it feels fresh and original plot-wise the film explores similar themes to films like total recall dark city and the matrix and its pretty staple sci-fi stuff morgan sullivan jeremy northam is a suburbanite who is bored with his life and has decided to take a job as a company spy for digicorp a large technological corporation he meets up with a recruitment officer at the beginning who brings sullivan on board and instructs him on what he has to do it basically involves going to conferences of rival companies and recording them via a satellite transmission device disguised as a pen it also means that he must take on a different persona and keep it a secret from his wife after his first job things become strange his habits change his personality begins to differ and he suffers pains in his neck and headaches as well as nightmares he encounters a beautiful woman named rita foster played by an intriguingly cast lucy liu he takes an instant attraction to however when he goes in his next job and sees her again she reveals herself to be an agent of some sort who reveals that his job is not quite what it seems he finds out later on that he and the rest of the people attending the conference all work for digicorp the conferences are all covers to allow the company men to brainwash their spies sullivan whose alternate name is jack thursby has been given an antidote to digicorps drugging and while the rest of the spies at the latest conference drift off into what seems like a brain-dead day dream while the speakers drone on the speakers send all the attendants to sleep via subliminal messages suddenly the rooms lights turn off and workers at digicorp come in shining lights in all the occupants eyes to ensure they are not conscious and then in a fairly nightmarish situation they bring in head sets for each member which send messages into the brain and brainwash the precipitants into believing they are someone else digicorp are using these people as puppets and creating personalities and lives for these people while wiping their own existence sullivan now must pretend that he entirely believes he is now jack thursby digicorp want to steal information from their rivals samways and they want their own puppets to do it they now effectively control what these spies do except for sullivan when samways get a hold of sullivan and discover he has not actually been brainwashed they decide to use him as a pawn to spy on digicorp make sullivan a double agent they know that digicorp have sent thursby to them to work his way into samways and work his way up the system until he can get into a situation to download important company information that could shut the company down samways realises he had been planted and decide they will play along with digicorp and allow thursby to infiltrate their databanks but they will give digicorp a dodgy disc that will ruin their system the plot begins to twist and turn as both companies are using sullivan as a pawn he is stuck in the middle and rita foster is a mystery as he tries to work out why she is helping him when a mysterious third party becomes involved the person it is revealed that foster works for sullivan must decide whether to go to this freelance agent who could guarantee him a new life and safety or to stick with one of the companies he works for the tension all builds to a stonking climax as it seems just about everyone wants to dispose of him once his usefulness has expires the cast are great northam is superb and the subtlety in his performance is excellent he brings a great visual aspect to his performance his eyes tell a story and we see a great subtle change as his character changes from sullivan to thursby lucy liu is just sexy beyond belief and her presence gives a great dynamic to the film because it seems strange casting but works because of that fact the rest of the cast are also gooddirector natali whose previous film was the cult classic sci-fi flick cube has a real visual flair he paces the film superbly as well and has given it a great look for a low budget film it features some imaginative visual effects and although the cgi isnt great it never begins too much of a centre piece to effect the film negatively the film really does bring feelings of the matrix and other great sci-fi films it is up there with them the plot nearly becomes too convoluted at times but in truth that helps in a film like this that is where the cronenberg and lynch influence is evident the film has you constantly working out what is going on and genuinely surprises as it goes along this is overall an obvious cult classic and i can see this being incredibly

we viewed the vcr and found it to be fascinating not knowing anything about this true story i thought: oh no pbrosnan as an american indian red indian in the film what a bad choice until i discovered the truth about grey owl the film does a good job of demonstrating the dignity of these native peoples and undermining the racist myths about them and annie galipeau wow what a beauty and very convincing as an indian woman i believe she is french-canadian; she sure reverts to the all-too familiar speech of such in spite of brosnans detached grunting style in the end he comes through convincingly as a passionate dedicated man the plot is a little weak in demostrating his conversion from trapper to animal coservationist good film highly recommended<SEP>1
americans have the attention span of a fruit fly and if something does not happen within the span of a typical commercial we tend to lose interest really fasti found out an exciting fact from this film: someone has to paint high tension utility poles and do it on a schedule! and guess what they really would like to be doing something else the viewer has similar feelingssurprisingly when i was bored watching late night infomercials and decided to actually watch this film i found the characters to be interesting and highly engagingi just dont usually watch that much late night tv so i cant recommend this film unless watching paint dry is your idea of an exciting two hours out of your life<SEP>0
i was a huge fan of the original cartoon series and was looking forward to finally seeing gadget on the big screen -- but i never in my wildest dreams expected something so extremely extremely terrible the pace was way too fast there was no plot and wowser! - what the hell is that it was wowsers!!<SEP>0
i had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago but its concept interested me when i heard it: an american man meets a european woman on his last night in europe and they spend the night together talking it sparked my interest but i never expected it to be this great before sunrise is a masterpiece and its also one of the most romantic films on record to my surprise it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s its impossible to really talk too much about it since there is no real plot so to speak although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about; it is sort of like my dinner with andre where there is a conversation but its not just the conversation that matters but let me just say see it see it!<SEP>1
one star for the plot one star for the acting one star for the dubbing into squeaky-voiced american five stars for monica broeke and inge maria granzow with their propensity for taking all their clothes off and ten out of ten for the divine emmanuelle béart two years before she made manon des sources béart also undresses a couple of times but even fully-clothed her presence is enough to make this film eminently watchable watch out for the scene where she tells her friend about the three first times for a girl its corny but still far more erotic than the rather laughably choreographed love scenes featuring broeke granzow and patrick bauchau incidentally the cinematography is not great; the stills for the closing credits are a better indication of what david hamilton is capable of<SEP>0
the hamiltons tells the story of the four hamilton siblings teenager francis cory knauf twins wendell joseph mckelheer & darlene mackenzie firgens & the eldest david samuel who is now the surrogate parent in charge the hamiltons move house a lot franics is unsure why& is unhappy with the way things are the fact that his brothers & sister kidnap imprison & murder people in the basement doesnt help relax or calm francis nerves either francis knows something just isnt right & when he eventually finds out the truth things will never be the same againco-written co-produced & directed by mitchell altieri & phil flores as the butcher brothers whos only other film directors credit so far is the april fools day 2008 remake enough said this was one of the films to die for at the 2006 after dark horrorfest or whatever its called & in keeping with pretty much all the others ive seen i thought the hamiltons was complete total & utter crap i found the characters really poor very unlikable & the slow moving story failed to capture my imagination or sustain my interest over its 85 & a half minute too long 86 minute duration the theres the awful twist at the end which had me laughing out loud theres this really big sustained build up to whats inside a cupboard thing in the hamiltons basement & its eventually revealed to be a little boy with a teddy is that really supposed to scare us is that really supposed to shock us is that really something that is supposed to have us talking about it as the end credits roll is a harmless looking young boy the best twist ending that the makers could come up with the boring plot plods along its never made clear where the hamiltons get all their money from to buy new houses since none of them seem to work except david in a slaughterhouse & i doubt that pays much or why they havent been caught before now the script tries to mix in every day drama with potent horror & it just does a terrible job of combining the two to the extent that neither aspect is memorable or effective a really bad film that i am struggling to say anything good aboutdespite being written & directed by the extreme sounding butcher brothers theres no gore here theres a bit of blood splatter & a few scenes of girls chained up in a basement but nothing you couldnt do at home yourself with a bottle of tomato ketchup & a camcorder the film is neither scary & since its got a very middle-class suburban setting theres zero atmosphere or mood theres a lesbian & suggest incestuous kiss but the hamiltons is low on the exploitation scale & theres not much here for the horror crowdfilmed in petaluma in california this has that modern low budget look about it its not badly made but rather forgettable the acting by an unknown to me cast is nothing to write home about & i cant say i ever felt anything for anyonethe hamiltons commits the cardinal sin of being both dull & boring from which it never recovers add to that an ultra thin story no gore a rubbish ending & characters who you dont give a toss about & you have a film that did not impress me at all<SEP>0
what was the deal with the clothes they were all dressed like something out of the late 70s early 80s the cars were even were outdated the school was outdated the nuns attire was outdated and the hospital looked like something from the 40s with its wards and wooden staircases and things nothing in the whole movie implied it took place in 1991 my mother was laughing saying geeeee-od! when was this movie made when we pressed the info button on our remote we were sure 1991 had to be typo! did anybody else notice this my favorite part though was when the woman tells her uppity muck husband on the telephone about the inverted cross in the mirror and he just says well look ive got a congress meeting ill talk to you about it later that line was just classic just like a man! my mothers favorite part was when they gave the spawn of the devil child her very own rottweiler my mother said just what the spawn of the devil needs a rottweiler she also enjoyed all of the people collapsing in the churches clutching their chests her other favorite part was the guy at the school parking lot driving 5 miles a hour driving right into the garbage truckdump truckfront end loader thingee he had about 20 seconds to just stop the carbut he just kept going with a real dumb vacant look on his face i mean how fast can you go in a school parking lot!! whatever!<SEP>0
theodore rex is possibly the greatest cinematic experience of all time and is certainly a milestone in human culture civilization and artistic expression!! in this compelling intellectual masterpiece jonathan r betuel aligns himself with the great film makers of the 20th century such as francis ford copola martin scorcese orson welles and roman polanski the special effects are nothing less than breathtaking and make any work by spielberg look trite and elementary at the time of its release theodore rex was such a revolutionary gem that it raised the bar of film-making to levels never anticipated by film makers the concept of making not just a motion picture featuring a dinosaur but adapting an action packed thrilling detective novel co-staring a talking dinosaur with a post-modern name such as theodore and an existential female police officer changed humanity as we know it the world could never be the same after experiencing such magnificent beauty watching theodore rex is much akin to looking into the face of god and hearing him say you are my most beloved creation this is one of the few films that is simply to die for!!!<SEP>1
this movie didnt really surprise me as such it just got better and better i thought: paul rieser wrote this huh wellwell see how he does then i saw peter falk was in it i appreciate colombo even though i was never a big fan of the show ive always liked watching peter falk the performances of peter and paul were so natural that i felt like a fly on the wall they played off of each other so well that i practically felt giddy with enjoyment! and i hadnt even been drinking!this movie was so well done that i wanted to get right on the phone to paul and let him know how much i enjoyed it! but i couldnt find his number must be unlisted or somethingthis was one of those movies that i had no idea what it was going to be about or who was in it or anything it just came on and i thought:eh why not lets see if i dont like it - i dont have to watch it and i ended up just loving it!<SEP>1
it is hard to describe this film and one wants to tried hard not to dismiss it too quickly because you have a feeling that this might just be the perfect film for some 12 years old girlthis film has a nice concept-the modern version of sleeping beauty with a twist it has some rather dreamy shots and some nice sketches of the young boy relationship with his single working mother and his schoolmate a nice start you might say but then it got a bit greedy very greedy it tries to be a science fiction a drama a thriller a possible romantic love story fairy tale a comedy and everything under the sun the result just left the audience feeling rather inadequate for example the scene when the girlplayed by risa goto finally woken by hisyuki kohara kiss instead of being romantic it trys to be scary in order to make us laugh afterwards it is a cheap trick because it ruin all the anticipation and emotion which it was trying to build for the better half of the filmi have not read the original story the film is base on it is the well-known work by the comic-book artist osamu tezuka is famous with his intriguing and intricate stories i wonder if all the problems exsist in the original story or did it occur in the adaption it is rather illogical even for someone who is used to the fussy logic of those japanese comic-book for instance how did yuki koharas character manage to get to the hospital in an instantwhen its suppose to be a long bus-ride awayto run away risa gotos character in front of the tv cameras right after he saw her live interview on the televisionthere are also some scenes that is directly copiedvery uncreative! from other films and they all seem rather pointlessly annoying ie the famous the lion mouth has caugh my hand scene from the roman holidaythe film tries to be everything but ends up being nothing it fails to be a fairy tale and it did not have enough jokes to be a comedy and strangely there are some scenes that even seem like an unintentional ghost movie nevertheless one should give it credit that it has managed to caputured some of the sentiment of the japanese teenagerit is by watching this film i have a feeling that there might be some films that should have come with a warning label that said this film might only be suitable for person under the 18 of age it would have definitly been on the poster of this film<SEP>0
i thought this was a splendid showcase for mandys bodacious bod if you dont expect anything else such as clever plot twists and believable character development you wont be disappointed consider this a sports illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people especially those who threaten to come between her and her mommy suzanna arquette who obviously doesnt want to play the sex kitten - she leaves that up to her daughtermandys face is a little too perfect but her body is a complete 5-alarm fire up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness a perfect 7-to-10 ratio of waist to hips and splendidly configured legs right down to her feet there has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye; mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratioand no flat butt to boot which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the nether hemispheres mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candle-lit hot tub with her blindfolded german-guy victim no 2 but from all i could see from her bikini shots she had the butt for it and didnt need a double to prove itmandys acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic mommys girl with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones her bisexual nature allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german guy no 2 who also happened to be her mothers lover added an additional dimension to an otherwise one-dimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses always by water with the men - the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reasonmandys uber-nordic facial features coupled with her uber-voluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse if mandy really wants to further her career as an actress id advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages especially italian and spanish - and maybe french although i dont know if they would go for her type but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra body - but maybe her face is just a little too nordic and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the 1980s whose early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the groundvambo drule<SEP>1
well thats 90 minutes of my life i wont get back this movie makes teen tv show california dreams look like almost famous the acting was horrid and storyline unrealistic dont even get me started on the actual band at the forefront of this story lame songs look etc you had to believe that they were one of the hottest bands in the country and there isnt enough irony in the world to accept that one the guitarist is seen to be a heroin user not that i blame him if i was around such a putrid band with stale songs and wooden acting id be injecting the horse tooif you take music remotely seriously avoid this at all costs<SEP>0
i felt this movie was as much about human sexuality as anything else whether intentionally or not we are also shown how absurd and paradoxical it is for women not to be allowed to such a nationally important event meanwhile forgetting the pasts of our respective advanced nations i write from japan where women merely got the right to vote 60 years ago and female technical engineers are a recent phenomenon pubs in england were once all-male the business world was totally off-limits for women in america until rather recently and women in china had their feet bound so they couldnt develop feet strong enough to escape their husbands iran is conveniently going through this stage in our time and we get a good look at how ridiculous we have all looked at one time or another back to the issue of sexuality we are made to wonder what it may be intrinsically about women that make them unfit for a soccer game the official reason is that the men are bad especially such boyish girls a couple so much so that you even get the feeling that lesbianism is on the agenda as well i think one point is that not all women are the same and the women the police are trying to protect are not the ones who would try to get in in the first place the opening scenes of the approach to the stadium makes you appreciate the valor of the young women trying to get in -- and each one separately -- at all it is a brutish mans world any woman brave enough to try to go should be allowed! the world of sexuality is not one-size-fits-allmeanwhile the apprehended criminal girls bond inside the makeshift pen awaiting their deportation to who-knows-where and in a much more subtle way begin to bond with the guards keeping watch over them these had definite ideas about women and femininity which were being challenged head-on the change in attitude is glacial but visiblesince the movie is pure iran from the first moment it takes a little easing-into for the foreigner but the characters have a special way of endearing themselves to you and you end up getting the whole picture and even understanding the mens misunderstandings and give them slack the supposed villain is the unseen patriarchy of the ayatollahs which remain unseen and unnamed and likely unrememberedknowing that this movie was filmed during the actual event of the iran-bahrain match gives me a feeling of awe for all involved<SEP>1

this could well be the worst film ive ever seen despite what mikshelt claims this movie isnt even close to being historically accurate it starts badly and then its all downhill from there we have hitlers father cursing his own bad luck on the fact that hed married his niece! they were in fact second cousins hitlers mother klara called his father alois uncle because alois had been adopted and raised by klaras grandfather and brought up as his son when he was really his nephew alois was much older than klara and so as a child shed got into the habit of calling alois unclethe scene in the trenches where hitler is mocked by his fellow soldiers and decides to take it out on his dog is simply a disgrace and an insult to the intelligence of all viewers we see hitler chase the dog through the trench when he catches up with the poor thing he proceeds to thrash it for disobeying him in the distance we see and hear his fellow soldiers continue to mock and chastise the cowardly little man but then a shell lands directly on his persecutors and every last one we are told is killed outright how then if hitler was the only person to survive the scene did this tale of brutality and cowardice come to be told did hitler himself go around boasting about it - i dont think sonext up hitler bullies and intimidates a poor stressed out and war weary jewish officer into giving him an iron cross! i can only assume that this jewish officer had been a pawnbroker before fighting for the fatherland and had thoughtfully brought along some pledged medals from his shop because im certain that iron crosses were not being handed out as shown in this comic farceall the grotesque clichés are here not least the calming and hypnotic effect of wagners music upon the little man if only the producers had kept ian kershaw on side then they might have discovered that franz lehars merry widow was more likely to float the fuhrers boat than any flying dutchman from the cannon of richard wagner!hitler may have been responsible for the deaths of 60 million people but how can he ever be forgiven for his appalling taste in musici could go on but id be at it for hoursgive it a miss<SEP>0
waiting to go inside the theathre with tickets in my hand i expected an interesting sci-fi fantasy movie which could finally feed my appetite of movies regarding robot-technology instead i went disappointed by each aspect of it once more proving that stunning special effects cant help a boring plot which by my opinion was the worse in this year acting in this movie also dissatisfied me will smith didnt show anything new in this movie yet i never saw his acting to change since men in black which was his only success by my opinion he had to retire since than not spoiling his name with titles like irobot and men in black 2 410<SEP>0
i went to see it 2 times this movie a friend of mine went to see it at the release party and he was telling me it was so great that i was expecting very much about the movie to mutch i couldnt enjoy it because i was not watching it in nuteral position the second time i knew what to expect and i enjoyed it more than the first time after the second time i felt so in the mood to have a party i loved the music its just greatif tom barman improves his directing talent he will be a director where everyone will be talking about if you can delivere this movie as your first you must be talentedthe acting is done by some great belgian stars dirk roofthooft and a bunch of upcomming talents like titus de voogdt<SEP>1
as far as cinematography goes this film was pretty good for the mid 50s there were a few times that the lighting was way too hot but the shots were generally in frame and stayed in focus the acting was above average for a low budget stinker but the direction was horrible several scenes were dragged out way too long in an attempt at suspense and the effects were non-existent the attack by the skull in the pond should have been completely removed from the final cut and every attempt to bring life to the skull was obvious with stick pokes and strings i also couldnt help but think the budget didnt allow them to furnish the house so they kept making references to the movers and that all the things in storage should be coming soon honestlyit would have been more entertaining if it were a worse movie it wasnt bad enough to be a good-bad movie but wasnt good enough to be good either get the mst3k versionits more fun<SEP>0
**possible spoilers**this straight-to-video mess combines a gun-toting heroine grade-z effects nazis a mummy and endless lesbian footage and its still boring; the videos 45 minute running time only seems like eternitythe only good part is one of the blooper outtakes wherein the bad guys force a 400-pound egyptologist into a chair--and one villains foot almost gets crushed under a chair leg take this snoozer back to the video store and watch televised golf bowling or tennis instead<SEP>0
this is your standard musical comedy from the 30s with a big plus that it features some well known 30s actors in small fun cameosthere is not much to the story and basically the movie is all about its fun and no-worries overall kind of atmosphere with a typical hal roach comedy touch to it appereantly its a cinderella story but i most certainly didnt thought of it that way while watching the movie the story gets very muddled in into the storytelling that features many different characters and also many small cameo appearance when the main characters hit the hollywood studiosof course the highlight of the movie is when laurel & hardy make their appearance and show some of their routines its like watching a movie and getting a laurel & hardy short with it for free also laurel & hardy regular walter long makes an appearance in the routine and james finlayson without a mustache this time as the director of the shortits certainly true that all of the cameos and subplots distract from the main plot line and character but in this case that is no problem since its all way more fun and interesting to watch than the main plot line and the shallow typical main characterthe movie is most certainly not any worse than any of its other genre movies from the same time period though the rating on here would suggest otherwise710<SEP>1
this film was a disaster from start to finish interspersed with performances from the next generation of beautiful losers are interviews with bono and the edge as well as the performers themselves this leaves little time for the clips of leonard cohen himself who towers over everyone else in the film with his commanding yet gentle presence wisdom and humor the rest are too busy trying to canonize him as st leonard or as some old testament prophet many of the performances are forgettable over-interpretations especially rufus & martha wainrights or bland under-achievements only beth orton and anthony got within striking distance of leonards own versions by using a little restraint annoying little pseudo-avant-garde gestures are sprinkled throughout the film- like out of focus superimpositions of red spheres over many of the concert and interview shots shaky blurred camera work use of digital delay on some of leonard cohens comments making it harder to hear whats being said and a spooky pretentious low drone under a lot of the interview segments an attempt at added gravitas for the real thing see the songs from the life of documentary produced by the bbc in 1988<SEP>0
grey gardens was enthralling and crazy and you just couldnt really look away it was so strange and funny and sad and sick and really no words can describe the move grey gardens is beyond bizarre i found out about this film reading my uncle johns great big bathroom reader by the bathroom readers institute and it was well worth the rental and bump to the top of my movie watching queue this movie is about the nuttiest most eccentric people that may have ever been filmed one should watch it for their favorite edie outfits which i am sure include curtains when i get old i almost wish to be just like big edie thumbing my nose at normalcy and society<SEP>1
first of all that i would like to say is that edison chen is extremely hot and that sam lee is looking much better than before xd! this is probably one of the most original movies i have seen so far; shows a poverty lifestyle background of a cambodian the cambodianedison aka pang goes around killing people to survive himself; has done it throughout his entire life sam leeswai duty is to capture the cambodian for good there are tons of violent actions but has a good story to it the movie shows the struggles between those two characters; they both beat each other like angry dogs go and watch pplstrongly suggessted!!! go hk films<SEP>1
ive really enjoyed this adaptation of emmai have seen it many times and am always looking forward to seeing it againthough it only lasts 107 minutes most of the novel plot and sub-plots were developed in a satisfactory way all the characters are well-portrayed most of the dialogues come directly from the novel with no silly jokes added as in emma thompsons sense and sensibilityas a foreigner i particularly appreciate the perfect diction of the actors the setting and costumes were beautiful i find this version quite on a par with the 1995 miniseries pride and prejudice but then the producer and screenwriter were the same kate beckinsale did a really good job portraying emma of whom jane austen said she would create a heroin no-one but her would love she is snobbish but has just enough youth and inexperience to be still likable mark strong was also very good at portraying mr knightley not an easy part i think though he has not the charisma shown by colin firths mr darcy in pride and prejudice even the end scene the harvest festival which does not happen in the novel provides a fitting end except for when it shows emma being cold and almost unpleasant with frank churchill whereas in the novel she was thoroughly reconciled with him even telling him that she would have enjoyed the duplicity had she been in his situation a strange departure from the faithfulness otherwise shown throughout the film i find the costumes more beautiful and elaborate than in other adaptations from jane austens novels<SEP>1
this is absolutely the worst movie ive seen all yearfirst i will say that the acting was very good and by all of the castthis was apparently meant to be very offbeat and in that regard it succeeded by the same token the story revolves around a self-centered wannabe who is a clueless talentless chronic liar whose source of self confidence comes from a pair of leather slippersthis was worse than watching a car wreck<SEP>0
actually had to stop it dont get me wrong love bad monster movies but this one was way too boring regardless of the suspenseful music that never leads you anywhere the actress had too many teeth and that moment when she makes contact with one of the beasts was way too obvious a cliché this film totally betrays the cover on the dvd which looks pretty interesting from the cover one expects a giant monster but you get these cute not as gigantic as expected electric eels moved on to watch another film called the killer rats but thats another review deep shock was really crap a big shame considering the fact that it looks pretty high budget<SEP>0
i grew up on this movie and i can remember when my brother and i used to play in the backyard and pretend we were in care-a-lot now after so many years have passed i get to watch the movie with my daughter and watch her enjoy it if you are parent and you have not watched this movie with your children then you should just so you hold them in your arms and watch them get thrilled over the care bears and care-a-lot! the songs especially forever young are very sweet and memorable parents i highly recommend this movie for all kids so they can learn how enjoyable caring for others can be! when it comes down to all the trash that is on tv you can raise your children to have the right frame of mind about life with movies like these<SEP>1
when i took my seat in the cinema i was in a cool mood and didnt plan on changing it but this movie is a dramatic powerhouse i was all in sweat and needed a shower afterward so what have we theoretically a coming of age story of a teenage turkish girl living in copenhagen denmark it came to my mind soon that the plot seemed pretty much completely borrowed from bend it like beckham where we had an indian girl playing football and spoiling the wedding of her sister here we have it transferred to a turkish girl spoiling her brothers wedding by doing kung fu and we have a love story and a competition of course too after i accepted this this really turned out to be a gripping emotional drama and it shows off some beautiful kung fu im not an expert though the lead actress semra turan is not only denmarks female champion but she also delivers an excellent performance so that it appears to be safe to assume that we have quite some autobiographic impressions here taking into account that this is her first movie and that she has no education as an actress rest of the supporting cast is okay camera good kung fu intense sidenotes: - the male turkish audience showed respect so that they must have done something right - the audience burst into cheers when our heroine finally fought back and attacked the boys who were gravely beating up her brother in revenge - xian gao a chinese cinematic kung fu instructoractor hidden tiger crouching dragon played the lead roles masterif you get the chance to see this in cinema do it youll probably have a good and intense experience and i dont know if this works on small screen as well<SEP>1
protocol is a hit-and-miss picture starring goldie hawn as a bubbly cocktail waitress who one night saves the life of a visiting arab from an assassination attempt the woman immediately becomes a celebrity and gets a new job working for the us government will the corridors of power in our nations capital ever be the same hawn is excellent as usual even though protocol isnt as funny as her best film private benjamin but its still a good movie and i did laugh alot*** out of four<SEP>1
well i guess it supposedly not a classic because there are only a few easily recognizable faces but i personally think it is its a very beautiful sweet movie henry winkler did a great job with his character and it really impressed me<SEP>1
what kind of a documentary about a musician fails to include a single track by the artist himself! unlike ray or countless other films about music artists half the fun in the theater or on the couch is reliving the great songs themselves here all the tracks are covers put on by uninteresting characters and these renditions fail to capture cohens slow jazzy style more often the covers are badly sung folk versions yuckthe interviews are as much or more with other musicians and figures rather than with cohen himself only rarely does the film feature cohen reading his own work never singing-- like letters poems etc the movie really didnt capture much about the artists life story either or about his development through the years a huge disappointment for a big cohen fan<SEP>0
i just watched this movie and have to say i was very impressed its very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat! i had to smoke several emergency cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves! if i had to criticise id say that perhaps if anything there were too many jump moments it got to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect because you kind of new what was comingalthough it contains virtually every cliché in the ghost genre they were all done so well that it maintained the creepy fear-factor it had elements of the shining the 6th sense and the changeling in particular the soundtrack reminded me of the changelingi would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good old-fashioned scare!<SEP>1
welcome to oakland where the dead come out to play and even the boys in da hood cant stop them this low-budget direct-to-video production seems timed to coincide with the release of land of the dead the latest installment of george a romeros famed zombie series the ghetto setting and hip-hop soundtrack may provide additional appeal for inner- city gore hounds ricky carl washington works at a medical research facility while raising his kid brother jermaine brandon daniels but the teenager bored by macaroni-and-cheese dinners in their tract house would rather spend his time hanging with street friends marco and kev apparently there is not a lot for african-american high-school dropouts to do on this side of the bay except deal drugs and scuffle with the homeys including rival latino gang bangers ricky plans to sell their late parents house and move inland to the castro valley a more middle-class and presumably safer environment unfortunately before this can happen a drive-by shooting leaves jermaine dead on the porch grief-stricken ricky tries a last desperate ploy he tells scotty his lab assistant to steal some of the experimental cell regeneration formula they have been testing on rats when a double dose fails to revive jermaine there is no choice except to call 911 but a funny thing happens on the way to the morgue the boy is reanimated as a sputtering growling zombie chews the ambulance drivers and staggers off into the night bent on revenge and hungry for fresh meat the feeding frenzy infects more victims and before the night is over the east bay is a battleground between the living and the blood-spattered undead the horror genre has seen more than its share of cheap movie makers from ed wood to herschel gordon lewis to charles band but low budgets do not necessarily mean bad films consider val lewtons programmers cat people the leopard man isle of the dead roger cormans poe quickies romeros night of the living dead and john carpenters halloween the difference between memorable and awful has more to do with talent and ambition than money hood of the living dead is more fun than several hundred million dollars worth of recent high-priced horrors cheapness has its charms in truly cheap films actors wear their own clothes amid real settings here the tract houses have freshly painted walls in neutral matte tones lending a bleakness as oppressive as douglas sirks bourgeois melodramas of the 50s lines seem more improvised than scripted so what the hell are we gonna do now just keep your eyes open for any f n thing that looks out of the ordinary ricky and scotty call their boss who calls an ex-military man named romero i have a huge bitch of a problem that we have to take care of fast not a problem says the merc closing his phone and grabbing his guns everybody has guns and even when fighting zombies theyre on their cell phones as who isnt nowadays information is exchanged with naturalistic understatement what happened we got into it with some crazy motherfockers deja f n vu its that park zombie again ricky even has to blow his twitching girlfriend away saying only shes gotten out of hand unlike most zombie movies this one provides a motive for mayhem jermaine takes revenge on the gang bangers who shot him who in turn continue the rumble this is urban film-making that implies its own social commentary a near-guerrilla production suggesting a future for low-budget horror that reflects real life instead of supernatural clichés the brothers quiroz who have trademarked their name as if in anticipation of a new movement may inspire others to tell stories arising from personal experience rather than imitating tired hollywood product considering their limited resources jose and eduardo quiroz have made a cheap but technically acceptable feature about people they know photographer rocky robinson gets the job done music by eduardo quiroz is no simpler than carpenters haunting halloween theme and hip-hop songs by the darkroom familia and others add atmosphere the result is promising if not exactly exhilarating they are learning their craft and unlike lewis and wood who never got any better their next may be one to watch<SEP>1
86 wasted minutes of my life i fell asleep the first time i attempted watching it and i must say im not one to ever fall asleep in the cinemai have never seen such a pointless plot acted in such a stilted and forced manner and can only surmise that the actors were as hard-up as the protagonist writer allegedly was in the film itselfeverything in this dire adaptation is overacted and if it isnt the wooden acting almost as though you can see the teleprompter then the set itself which is overlit and interfering in utterly unnecessary ways and overdressed to an unimaginable extent is enough to put you off the entire farceas to the supposed shock of a detective under disguise any person who does not see that - as well as the entire rest of this ludicrous plot - telegraphed light years in advance should check their eyesight immediatelybad acting and from two very decent actors coupled with the hyper-coddled branagh trademark overdirection is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than blanks yourselfon top of it all there is a completely risible undertone of homoerotica in this heightened towards the end of it all i can hope for is that this was such a flop that people shant try to emulate this level of cinema ever again<SEP>0
moe and larry are newly henpecked husbands having married shemps demanding sisters at his music studio shemp learns he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone himself! husbands beware is a remake of 1947s brideless groom widely considered by many to be one of the best stooge films with shemp the remake contains most of the footage from that film the new scenes shot may 17 1955 include the storyline of moe and larry marrying shemps sisters along with their cooking of a turkey laced with turpentine! a few new scenes are tacked onto the end of the film as wella double for dee green was used; if you blink you will miss the doubles appearance husbands beware would have made for a good film with just the plot line of marrying the sisters budget considerations coupled with fewer bookings for two-reel comedies influenced the decision to use older footagealthough completely new films were still being made by the stooges most of their releases by 1955-56 were made up of older films with a few new scenes tossed in husbands beware while one of these hybrids is watchable and entertaining; we get to see most of brideless groom again and the new scenes are funny enough to get the viewer through the film this film is one of the last stooge comedies to feature new footage of shemp and it was released six weeks after his death7 out of 10<SEP>1
this was the funniest piece of filmtape i have ever witnessed bar none i laughed myself sick the first three times i watched it i recommend it to everyone with the warning that if they cant handle the f-sharps to stay far away at his best when telling stories from a kids point of view<SEP>1
this movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie ive ever seen and thats saying a lot considering ive seen such stinkers like demon of paradise lovers lane and bloody murder which is a close second however i love bad horror movies and as you can tell from my username this one really sticks out at times theres nothing more entertaining than a poorly made slasher flick as for this film the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth appears to have no bearing on the film whatsoever especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened 2 years prior to the rest of the film the acting is nonexistent and most of the camera shot are of womens areas shrink wrapped in spandex the policeman was the most stone-faced monotone actor ive ever seen the bestworst part of this movie however has to be the murder weapon a giant safety pin! what were they thinking whos the killer a disgruntled huggies employee id have to give this movie an overall zero but darned if i didnt have a blast watching it<SEP>0
can i give this a minus rating no well let me say that this is the most atrocious film i have ever tried to watch it was painful boringus maximus the plot is well hidden in several sub-levels of nebulosity i rented this film with a friend and after about thirty minutes of hoping it would get better we decided to fast forward a little to see if things would get any better it never gets better this film about some dude getting kidnapped by these two girls sounds interesting but in reality it is just a bore nothing even remotely interesting ever happens if you ever get the chance to watch this do yourself a favor try plan nine from outer space instead<SEP>0
man this movie sucked big time! i didnt even manage to see the hole thing my girlfriend did though really bad acting computer animations so bad you just laugh woman to werewolf strange clips the list goes on and on dont know if its just me or does this movie remind you of a porn movie and i dont mean all the naked ladys its something about the light or something this could maybee become a classic just because of the bad acting and all the naked women but not because its an original movie white a nice plot twist my final words are: dont see it! its not worth the time if you wanna see it because the nakedness theres lots of better ones to see!<SEP>0
i remembered this show from when i was a kid i couldnt remember too much about it just a few minor things about the characters for some reason i remembered it being really intense also it was on really really early in the morning up in pa i finally after looking around the web for a long time found an episode the first episode no-less criminey! this show was so horrible it was obviously just made to show kids playing lazer tag and having a great time the show opens with bhodi li telling his mommy my names not christopher im bhodi li-photon warrior!!!!! we then are forced to watch kids playing lazer tag to the song foot loose and not just a quick little bit but the whole song ahhhhhhhhh my brain hurts just thinking about it oh yeah and as if i couldnt get worse you cant even see the laser beams from their guns its like theyre just running around to the entire foot loose song later on after bhodi goes up into space or where-ever they have a crappy laser gun fight to the phil collins song su-su-sudio ah trust me you dont want to know the rest what can i saythe light shines!!!!!!!!!!!<SEP>0
a warm sweet and remarkably charming film about two antagonistic workers in the same shop james stewart and margaret sullavan who are carrying on a romance via mailbox without either of them knowing it the key to this films success is that ernst lubitsch keeps any syrupy sentimentality absent and calls on his actors to give low-key unfussy performances as a result you fall in love with virtually all of themtheres a strong undercurrent of melancholy running through this film which i appreciated loneliness is a major theme most obviously represented in the character of the shops owner and manager played wonderfully by frank morgan he discovers that hes being cuckolded by his wife and realizes that the successful life hes created for himself isnt enough to keep him from feeling lonely when he doesnt have a partner to share it this makes the timid romance between stewart and sullavan all the more poignant because theyre both reaching out to this unseen other who each thinks of as a soulmate before theyve even met of course we know everything will turn out right in the end but the movie doesnt let you forget the dismal feeling either of them would feel if they found that the reality didnt live up to the fantasylubitsch fills his movie out with a crackerjack cast that has boatloads of chemistry the little group of shop employees refers to itself throughout the movie as a little family and thats exactly how it feels to us as wellthis is a wonderful unsung romancegrade: a+<SEP>1
thunderbirds 2004 director: jonathan frakes starring: bill paxton ben kingsley brady corbet 5 4 3 2 1! thunderbirds are go! and so began thunderbirds a childhood favorite of mine when i heard that they were going to make a thunderbirds movie i was ecstatic i couldnt wait to see thunderbird 2 roar in to save people while thunderbird 4 would dive deep into the you get the idea i just couldnt wait then came august 2004 when the movie was finally released critics panned it but i still wanted to go after all as long as the heart was in the same place that was all that mattered to me so i sat down in the theater the only teenager in a crowd of 50 everyone else was over thirty and under ten quite possibly the most awkward theater experience that i have ever had the movie which is intended to be a prequel focuses on alan tracy brady corbet the youngest of the tracy family he spends his days wishing that he could be rescuing people like the rest of his family but hes too young one day he finally gets his chance when the hood ben kingsley traps the rest of his family up on thunderbird 5 the space station this involves him having to outsmart the hoods henchmen and rescue his family in time before the hood can steal all of the money from the bank of englandtrust me the plot sounds like a regular episode of thunderbirds when you read it on paper once it gets put on to film what a mess we have on our hands first off the film was intended for children much like the original show was however gerry anderson treated us like adults and gave us plots that were fairly advanced for childrens programming this on the other hand dumbs down the plot as it tries to make itself a ripoff of the spy kids franchise the final product is a movie that tries to appeal to fans of the thunderbirds series and children while missing both entirely lame jokes cartoonish sounds and stupid antics that no one really finds amusing are all over this movie and im sure that jonathan frakes is wishing hed never directed thisover all everyone gave a solid performance considering the script that they were all given ben kingsley was exceptional as the hood playing the part extremely well my only complaint about the characters is about the hoods henchmen who are reduced to leftovers from old looney tunes cartoons bumbling about as amazingly enough the kids take them on with easewhats odd about this movie is that while i was watching the movie i had fun but once the lights went up i realized that the movie was fairly bad i was $8 lighter and two hours of my time were now gone a guilty pleasure perhaps nonetheless thunderbirds is a forgettable mess instead of a big go im going to have to recommend that you stay away from this movie if the rest of movie could have been like the first ten minutes of it it would have been an incredible film worthy of the thunderbirds name however we get a movie that only die-hard thunderbirds fans if youd like to watch your childhood torn to pieces or the extremely bored should bother withmy rating for thunderbirds is 1 ½ stars<SEP>0
young mr lincoln marks the first film of the directorstar collaboration of john ford and henry fonda i recall years ago fonda telling that as a young actor he was understandably nervous about playing abraham lincoln and scared he wouldnt live up to the challengejohn ford before the shooting starts put him at ease by saying he wasnt going to be playing the great emancipator but just a jack-leg prairie lawyer that being settled fonda headed a cast that john ford directed into a classic filmthis is not a biographical film of lincoln that had come before in the sound era with walter huston and a year after young mr lincoln raymond massey did the pulitzer prize winning play by robert sherwood abe lincoln in illinois massey still remains the definitive lincolnbut as ford said fonda wasnt playing the great emancipator just a small town lawyer in illinois the film encompasses about 10 years of lincolns early life we see him clerking in a general store getting some law books from an immigrant pioneer family whose path he would cross again later in the story and his romance with ann rutledge with her early death leaving lincoln a most melancholy beingfast forward about 10 years and lincoln is now a practicing attorney beginning to get some notice hes served a couple of terms in the legislature but hes back in private practice not really sure if politics is for himthis is where the bulk of the action takes place the two sons of that family hed gotten the law books from way back when are accused of murder he offers to defend them and not an ordinary murder but one of a deputy sheriff the trial itself is fiction but the gambit used in the defense of richard cromwell and eddie quillan who played the two sons is based on a real case lincoln defended ill say no moreother than the performances the great strength of young mr lincoln is the way john ford captures the mood and atmosphere and setting of a small illinois prairie town in a fourth of july celebration its almost like youre watching a newsreel and it was the mood of the country itself young vibrant and growingfans of john ford films will recognize two musical themes here that were repeated in later films during the romantic interlude at the beginning with fonda and pauline moore who played ann rutledge the music in the background is the same theme used in the man who shot liberty valance for vera miles and at a dance the tune lovely susan brown that fonda and marjorie weaver who plays mary todd is the same one fonda danced with cathy downs to in my darling clementine at the dance for the raising of a church in tombstone lincoln will forever be a favorite subject of biographers and dramatists because of two reasons i believe the first is hes the living embodiment of our own american mythology about people rising from the very bottom to the pinnacle of power through their own efforts in fact young mr lincoln very graphically shows the background lincoln came from and secondly the fact that he was our president during the greatest crisis in american history and that he made a singularly good and moral decision to free slaves during the civil war albeit for some necessary political reasons his assassination assured his place in historybesides fonda and others ive mentioned special praise should also go to fred kohler jr and ward bond the two town louts kohler being the murder victim and bond the chief accuser also donald meek as the prosecuting attorney and alice brady in what turned out to be her last film as the pioneer mother of cromwell and quillan and a very nice performance by spencer charters who specialized in rustic characters as the judgefor a film that captures the drama and romance of the time its set in you cant do better than young mr lincoln<SEP>1
this has to be the worst and i mean worst biker movie ever made! and thats saying a lot because the line of stinkers is long and smelly!now at least we know what happened to ginger after she was rescued from gilligans island! a frightened looking tina louiseshe was probably afraid someone would see this mess!is a stranded motorist who is tormented by the most repulsive motorcycle gang in film history but dont worry fans! batman i mean adam west as a hick-town doctor comes to the rescue! pow! crush! boom! holy toledo batman! the only good points of this bomb are some cute women some laughable fight scenes and the still sexy tina louise!<SEP>0
i liked nearly all the movies in the dirty harry series with the exception of the one i think is titled enforcer deadpool was a bit weak in areas too but i still enjoyed it this one is one of my favorites of the series if nothing else for the great line of go ahead make my day this one also features an interesting albeit familiar plot of someone killing those that have done her wrong just think magnum force with less mystery about who is behind the killings and you have your plot granted there is a bit more than that as this one does feature a very nice final showdown at an amusement park it also features dirty harry getting a bulldog as a gift and it tripping up sandra locke in a rather humorous scene the only question that remains is why clint eastwood had to have the rather mediocre actress sandra locke in so many of his movies she brings the score down a point every time even when overall the movie is enjoyable to me granted she is not to bad here but her character could have been so much better by someone else another problem with this movie and other dirty harry movies at times they almost seem to be advertisements for guns i like guns as much as the next person but do we really need scenes of him explaining all the different strengths of his newest weapon and how many bullets it holds still very nice entry into the dirty harry series of movies<SEP>1
i happened across bait on cable one night just as it started and thought eh why not im glad i gave it a chance bait aint perfect it suffers from unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional dumbness but overall this movie worked all the elements aligned just right and they pulled off what otherwise could have been a pretty ugly film most of that i think is due to jamie foxx i dont know who tagged foxx for the lead but whoever it was did this movie a big favor believable and amazingly likeable foxx glides through the movie smooth as butter and funnier than hell you can tell hes working on instinct and instinct doesnt fail himthe plot while unimportant actually ties together pretty well and theres even a character arc through which foxxs character grows as a person again they couldve slipped by without any of this but it just makes things that much betterim surprised at the low rating for this maybe i just caught this move on the right night or vice versa but id give it a 710 bravo mssr foxx<SEP>1
im afraid that youll find that the huge majority of people who rate this movie as a 10 are highly christian i am not if you are looking for a christian movie i recommend this film if you are looking for a good general movie im afraid youll need to go elsewherei was annoyed by the characters and their illogical behaviour the premise of the movie is that the teaching of morality without teaching that it was jesus who is the basis of morality is itself wrong one scene shows the main character telling a boy that it is wrong to steal and then the character goes on to say that it was jesus who taught us this i find that offensive: are we to believe that thou shalt not steal came from jesus i suppose he wrote the ten commandments and stealing was acceptable before that i rented the movie from netflix i should have realized the nature of the movie from the comments oh well<SEP>0
if this guy can make a movie then i sure as hell can make one tooin fact if you hire me to make a movie for you i promise to do the following:1 i will add more naked women this movie had none i think cheesy b-class horror movies are only rented because of their traditional exploitation of the female body i wouldnt want to let my viewers down2 i will refrain from making too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out its only a dream i think horrorvision had about 4 of these scenes and considering the movie was only like an hour long the dream-to-movie-length ratio was quite high and if i do decide to do a dream sequence i will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes on i mean who sleeps in leather pants3 i will not rip off any movies like star wars or the matrix because i will know that my budget is small and i will not want to mask my contempt for big-budget hollywood movies by adding satirical references about them in mine 4 and finally i will not mix modern technology with the undead i mean a palm pilot can only be so scary at least they turned it into an evil rolly-polly monster before the screen blew up or somethingso if you are looking for the above qualities in your next horror production count on me: wanna-b-movie director extraordinaire<SEP>0
james stewart and margaret sullavan play co-workers in a budapest gift shop who dont really like each other not knowing theyre really sweetheart pen pals who have yet to meeta very charming romantic comedy very engagingly played by its two likable stars and a very eager-to-please supporting cast the story is well written and the film has that romantic innocence dont quite know how to explain it that films today just dont have this can obviously be compared to the recent youve got mail and the original wins in every waythis is mandatory viewing each christmas i cant think of a better way to jumpstart a christmas feel than this little gem<SEP>1
this movie was god-awful from conception to execution the us needs to set up a star wars site in this remote country this is their premise the way to gain access the us concludes is to win an obstacle course like cross-country race where the winner can ask anything of the leader and who better to win this race known as the game than a gymnast of course! a gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission and dont forget that his father was an operative lucky for our hero there happen to be gymnastic equipment in fortunate spots like the stone pommel horse in the middle of a square for no reason amidst crazy town perfectbut above and beyond the horrible horibble premise is the awkward fumblings of the romantic scenes the obviously highly depressed ninjas whose only job seems to be holding a flag to point out the race path and the worst climax ever after winning the race our hero puts forth the wishes of the us government and lo and behold all the effort was worth it because the us gets its star wars site! huzzah! this is your triumphant ending! wowbut still being such a bad movie it can be great fun to watch the cover alone depicting ninjas with machine guns was enough to get me to rent this filmbut if i were ever to meet kurt thomas the gymnast-star in real life i would probably kick him in the face after a double somersault with 2 12 twists in the layout position<SEP>0
unless somebody enlightens me i really have no idea what this movie is about it looks like a picture with a message but it´s far from it this movie tells pointless story of a new york press agent and about his problems and that´s basically all when that agent is played by pacino one must think that it must be something important but it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is to one of the best actors in the world al pacino this is the second movie of the year the other is simone that deserves the title the most boring and the most pointless motion picture of the year so what´s going on al<SEP>0
ok first of all steve irwin rest in peace you were loved by many fans nowthis movie wasnt a movie at all it was the crocodile hunter tv program with bad acting bad scripts and bad directing in between steve capturing or teaching us about animals he was entertaining as an animal seekerspecialist millions will miss him but the whole movie idea was a big mistake the plot was so broken it was almost non-existent casting was horrible the acting wasnt even worth elementary school-level actors the direction must be faulted as well if you cant get a half-way decent performance out of your actors no matter how bad the script is you must not be that good in the first place i could have written a better script i wish i had never been to see this movie of course i watched it for $3 $150 for me $150 for my son while out with friends who insisted upon seeing this instead of scooby doo live action my son who is not so discriminating liked the movie alright but he still has never asked to see it again if you want fond memories of steve irwin buy his series on dvd avoid this movie like the plague if i were steve i know i wouldnt want to be remembered for this movie respect him: avoid this movie!<SEP>0
the plot of 7eventy 5ive involves college kids who play a cruel phone game that unexpectedly to them if not to fans of horror gets them in over their heads the story of 7eventy 5ive on the other hand is that of a horror film that had a wee little bit of promise sadly outweighed by really bad writingwhat could have been a fun if somewhat silly old-fashioned slasher tale is derailed early on by its filmmakers misguided belief that the audience would enjoy watching a bunch of loud whiny rich kids bitching at each other for most of the films running time with the exception of a police detective played by rutger hauer in a minor role that is designed mainly to add the movies only star power every character on screen is a different breed of young a-holemale and female black and white straight and gay an entire ensemble of shallow and shrill college kids carries the bulk of the films narrative worse since the tale deals with a party game gone awry most of the time the scenes are completely filled with these little b*****ds because of this there are few breaks for the viewer who must put up with the angry sniping of the thinly-drawn protagonists even though at least some of these people are supposedly friends invariably all characters interact in a very hostile manner long before any genuine conflict has actually arisen this leads to the worst possible result in a slasher film: the audience intended to care about the leads instead not only cheers on the anonymous killer but wishes that he had arrived to start picking off the vacuous brats far earlierthe real shame of this poor characterization is that otherwise 7eventy 5ive actually did have some potential visually its fine first-time directors brian hooks and deon taylor know how to build a suspenseful mood they also manage to deliver on some competent if sparse moments of classic 80s-style gore surprisingly the productions cast is also fairly able it isnt that the actors arent capable of expressing realistic human emotion; it is simply that the screenplay co-written by newcomer vashon nutt and director hooks who fared much better behind the camera than with a keyboard is short of such moments7eventy 5ive can hardly be recommended as its familiar premise and few thrills cant outweigh the bad taste left behind by a story driven by a gaggle of unpleasant characters in this tepid whodunnit the real mystery is why anyone should care about a group of young folk who cant even manage to like each other<SEP>0
using footage pillaged from planet of dinosaurs this shot on video except for the stolen footage concerns a bunch of people shot into space who land on a dinosaur planet that isdont wait for it is really earth its a five minute sketch stretched to 90 minutes slightly better than chickboxer another in the bad movie police series-having a nostalgic home movie feel coupled with good stolen effects this movie is still an impossible slog to get through im left to ponder the question are we becoming so uncreative that were now pillaging old movies not only for plot but also for mismatched footage clearly low budget producers are getting so desperate they really will give us anything to take our money<SEP>0
ill say one thing for jeanette and nelson--even when stranded in a mirthless witless painfully inept musical like this theres still that twinkle in their eyes yes the chemistry between the famous duo is there even when the material is paper thin even when the score is practically a throwaway non-existent one depending on just a couple of catchy tunes and even when the circumstances are so unbelievable--yes even for a fantasytruth to tell she has more chemistry with nelson than with her own real-life husband gene raymond in smilin through which nonetheless was a considerably better filmsorry i love jeanette and nelson as much as the next fan but this is the bottom of the heap jeanette is more than embarrassing in her one hep number with binnie barnes--and nelson can only come up with a blank stare when faced with the most ludicrous situationsone can only wonder what this was like on broadway in 1938 surely it must have had more wit and style than is evident in this weak mgm production edward everett horton fizzles in an unfunny role and none of the supporting players can breathe any semblance of life into this mess its like amateur night at the studio even with the few professionals sprinkled among the supporting castsumming up: painfully clumsy rendering of a rodgers and hart musical cant recommend it even for fans of macdonald and eddy and even if jeanettes close-ups still glow with her gossamer beauty this film is jaw-droppingly bad<SEP>0
having the opportunity to watch some of the filming in the slavic village-broadway area i couldnt wait to see its final copyviewing this film at the cleveland premier last fridayi havent laughed out loud at a comedy in a long time! it is great slapstick the russo brothers did a fine job directing the entire cast performs their best comedic acting no slow or dry segments george clooney is one of my favorite actors and hes great as the crippled safe breaker in this flick i was most imprest by william h macy as crook riley and michael jeters as toto they keep you in stitches i believe they have the funniest roles in the entire movie<SEP>1
ive rarely been as annoyed by a leading performance as i was by ali mcgraws in this movie god is she bothersome or what! she says everything in the same tone and is horrible so horrible in fact that by contrast ryan oneal is brilliant there is not much of a story hes rich shes wooden they both have to sacrifice a lot for love his father is stonewall jackson hers is called by his first name in case you didnt notice the difference in the two of them that they overcame in the name of love the oscar nominations for this movie indicate it had to have been a bad year john marley is fine as woodens father but a supporting nomination at least ali didnt win i still think katharine ross should have played jennifer but then again if it were up to me katharine ross would have been in a lot more movies shes certainly a better actress than mcgraw i didnt even cry when she got sick never occured to me to even feel sad it was nice to see tommy lee jones looking like he was about 15 and the score is good but this one is so old by now it has a beard a mile long and the sin of that is its not that old but it feels it<SEP>0
bela lugosi revels in his role as european horticulturalist sic dr lorenz in this outlandish tale of horror and dementia the good doctors aging wife needs fluids harvested from the glands of young virgins in order to retain her youth and beauty what better place for the doctor to maintain his supply than at the alter where he kidnaps the unsuspecting brides before they can complete their vows sedating them into a coma-like state he brings them to his mansion to collect his tainted bounty according to the dvd sleeves synopsis that brief description is much more entertaining and imaginative than the movie** the corpse vanishes 1942 wallace fox ~ bela lugosi luana walters elizabeth russell<SEP>0

this is a very interesting project which could have been quite brilliant gathering 11 prominent international directors and allotting each of them 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame to create a segment of their choice; each short exploring the global reverberations of 911 without using any spoilers i would say that ken loachs piece is the jewel in the crown and mira nairs short segment india based on a true story deserves to be made into a full feature film one also realizes while watching his short why alejandro gonzález iñárritu is one of the best directors in the world today  he simply is a master of the medium who has also a profound understanding of the subject matter unfortunately not all 11 parts are made as well youssef chahine in his segment egypt assumes the arab stance of the self-inflicted collective guilt which piece could have potentially been the most interesting one he fails miserably chahines short is poorly written and badly executed at least enough to stand out amongst other superior chapters of the film despite the imbalance in quality i would still give the film 710 for concept if not for execution<SEP>1
every great gangster movie has under-currents of human drama dont expect an emotional story of guilt retribution and despair from scarface this is a tale of ferocious greed corruption and power the darker side of the fabled american dreamanybody complaining about the cheesiness of this film is missing the point the superficial characters cheesy music and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess nothing in the lives of these characters really matter not on any human level at least in fact the film practically borderlines satire ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of tony montanathis isnt brian depalmas strongest directorial effort it is occasionally excellent and well-handled particularly the memorable finale but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled thankfully it is supported by a very strong script by oliver stone probably good therapy for him considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time the themes are consistent with the focus primarily on the life of tony montana and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power the dialogue is also excellent see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama there are many stand-out lines which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or anotherthe cast help make it what it is as well but this is really pacinos film one of his earlier less subtle performances something much more common from him nowadays this is a world entirely separate from michael corleone and frank serpico yet he is as watchable here as ever in very entertaining and intentionally over-the-top form it is hard to imagine another tony montana after seeing this film in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing but ive come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife not an exceptional effort but unfairly misjudged the supporting players are very good too particularly paul shenar as the suave alejandro sosapowerful occasionally humorous sometimes shocking and continually controversial scarface is one of the films of the eighties whatever that might mean to you an essential and accessible gangster flick and a pop-culture landmark 910<SEP>1
saw this movie twice at community screenings and really loved it i work in the jane finch community and feel the film really captured some of the essence and flavour of the community - grit determination exuberance creativity in your faceness with a dose of desperation the writing dialogue and acting is solid and i really found myself drawn into the story of the young woman raya as she struggles to pursue her goals and not lose herself in the process great dance sequences and it is not only the bodies that move smoothly and with electricity but the camera moves with great fluidity and intelligence as well all the characters are multi dimensional - none wholly good or bad and the women characters are admirably strong this is a film that has a strong beating heart and celebrates the irrepressible spirit of youth hip hop and communities like jane finch<SEP>1
way to go ace! you just made a chilling grossly intriguing story of a necrophiliac cannibal into a soft mellow drama obviously a movie called dahmer would be one of two kinds: horror or documentary right this was neither it wasnt close to any detailed facts in fact it barely had any substance at all it wasnt really morbid or scary or didnt even try to be very disturbingas if you wouldve had to try!! what the hell was this writerdirector thinking heres one of the most real examples of sick serial killers ever and we get badly shot poorly acted gay bar roofie rapes and lengthy droning flashbacks to alone time in his old parents house i think jacobson was actually trying to present or invent the soft side of jdahmer<SEP>0
wowspeechless as to the making of this film i cant say much the coverbox at the local videostore shouldve said it allnothing but 6 actorsactresses who get lost on the set of scream and decide to shoot a movie!the acting was apparently not in the budget but they were able to afford nudity and good-looking actors! style over substance almost makes its mark here except most of these acting-class failures keep forgetting that there is a plot that needs to go somewhere when they were reading this script after only 4 or 5 kills by the so-called masked murderer and a confusing tie-in plot about a murder club which the dumb lead actress thinks is a real club that she can join only if she can get over a girl bumping into her car you want to stab your hands with the nearest sharp object to remind yourself never to get overly excited by a possibly good movie such as thisi feel bad for the people who bought this film and cant find anyone to take it off their hands another example of whats wrong with the growing number of straight to video horror releases with no thought put into the essentials throw it away if you did buy this<SEP>0
not very impressed its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film because there is almost no development in the plot everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry the acting seems very poor as well and reminds me of the old black and white maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime chinese television although this is difficult to tell with the female role yuwen as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin it reminds me of fading star gong li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the west for having a scowl on her face all the time tian zhuangzhuangs film the blue kite was a far better film but dont be fooled by the fact that springtime in a small town was set in the late 40s unlike the blue kite the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdropi wonder whether tian zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of chinese films in the west and appeal to a foreign audience who cant tell the difference between a film that is beautiful profound or hypnotic and one that is simply tedious and insubstantialif any film fits the description of overrated this is it i see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the chinese film industry<SEP>0
this is the neil simon piece of work that got a lot of praises! the odd couple is a one of a kind gem that lingers within you got felix ungarjack lemmon; a hypochondriac fussy neat-freak and a big thorn in the side of his roommate oscar madisonwalter matthau; a total slob these men have great jobs though felix is a news writer and oscar is a sports writer both of these men are divorced felixs wife is nearby while oscars is on the other side of the us the west coast well what can you say two men living in one roof together without driving each other crazy is impossible as well as improbable its a whole lot of laughs and a whole lot of fun i liked the part where when those two british neighbors that speak to both gentlemen and after oscar kicked out felix he gets lucky and lives with them when he refused to have dinner with them the night earlier its about time that felix needed to lighten up i guess all neat-freaks neat to lighten up they can be fussy yet they should be patient as well a very fun movie and a nuevo classic neil simons the odd couple is a must see classic movie 5 stars!<SEP>1
having read some good reviews about this film i thought it was about time i go and see it well i dont know why i bothered basically this family is entrusted with a clue that leads to a whole big stash of ancient treasure hidden by the knights templar during the war of independence apparently it had to be kept out of the hands of the british at all costs firstly why did said knights move the treasure from europe to america how did nic cages character figure out that charlotte was in fact a ship how do they figure out all the clues and riddles in about a minute and how could two people suddenly become master thieves and steal what is probably the best guarded bit of paper in the world these are just some of the plot holes in this inane bit of hollywood action gone wrong cage has been in some great action movies - face-off and the rock - so why has he lowered himself to this is he getting too old! his character is pretty annoying really - somehow this ordinary guy steals the declaration of independancd outruns thieves with guns escapes from the fbi and generally seems invincible the whole film doesnt really make any sense and all in all it was quite a disappointment<SEP>0
why didnt the producers give that show a chance of all the junk on tv why didnt the producers give six degrees a chance will the series go on video i would love to see how it ends put season one on video and sell it i was a loyal fan of six degrees and waited for its return i set my recorder to tape all of the shows thank god for that i just found out that the show was canceled and im heart broken i wish i knew it was going to be canceled why didnt they tell us i thought the show was just developing some depth in the characters the writing was pretty good also steven campbell scott is my all time favorite i am so sorry to see it go!<SEP>1
i was very excited about this film when i first saw the previews normally i see a preview this good and i buy the film outright something told me to you know watch it first im glad i did keira knightley ruined all future films for me with this role in the 2nd pirates movie when it came out i went to see it all i saw was domino harvey and i hated her more for it i think that had to do with her hair and having to cut it short for dominodomino who who is domino harvey i still dont really know or care i dont know who she was in real life or who she was in this film i didnt care about her character and even keira getting partically naked didnt make it worth the movie the direction was definitely lacking the writing was trite and shallow the editing was horrible i dont mind the style so much as the poor overuse of it theres a place for it good examples of choppy mtv style colorful editing not sure if theres an official name would be fight club; just off the top of my head even enemy of the state had a semi similar editing style at parts it was used tastefully and wasnt used as a crutch i mean this is the same guy who directed top gun and crimson tide tony scott please give me my time backi understand there are many people who liked this movie i guess the idea that youll either completely love this movie or completely hate it is a fair assessment frankly i hate it<SEP>0
i really have no idea how to comment on this movie the special effects were lackluster the acting was terrible and if there was a plot to it all it was on the back of the box i dont think i can remember a movie being this bad in a long time and im a big fan of lesbian sex and boobies!! ; even that couldnt save this movie from being just a terrible excuse to pay someone to stand or lay in this case in front of a camerai was pretty much let down by the overall zombie effect since apparently in this movie zombies are so commonplace that running over a couple here and there and casually talking about it at a gas station one with an in-house windshield repair but no interior bathroom the zombie-movie genre isnt even a factor until the end even then a cameo by a dozen zombies ripping off a girls clothes doesnt really constitute being a zombie movieon to the vampires: apparently all the zombies are male and all the vampires are female which is ok by me im not sure how vampires are out in the daylight or the whyhow of a soldier vampire came to be standing in the middle of the road still holding his gun with a stake through his heart just waiting for the queen of the vampires to flick it all the way through the last segment in the old nunnery made no sense and when one hot lesbian vampire asks the other hot lesbian vampire do you think we did the right thing by killing the two apparent heroes in the movie that about put it over the topthe acting and special effects were at an all-time low also you could almost see the hoses that the fake blood was pumped out of during the closeup of the zombie who got ran over by the general speaking of the general where did they find this kenny rogers look-alike anyways no idea what he was the general of aside of generally confusing and misplacedall in all watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have the strong urge to waste $3 just my $002<SEP>0
the saddest thing about this tribute is that almost all the singers including the otherwise incredibly talented nick cave seem to have missed the whole point where cohens intensity lies: by delivering his lines in an almost tuneless poise cohen transmits the full extent of his poetry his irony his all-round humanity laughter and tears in oneto see some of these singer upstarts make convoluted suffering faces launch their pathetic squeals in the patent effort to scream im a singer! is a true pain its the same feeling many of you probably had listening in to some horrendous operatic versions of simple songs such as lennons imagine nothing simply nothing gets close to the simplicity and directness of the original if there is a form of art that doesnt need embellishments its cohens art embellishments cast it in the street looking like the tasteless make-up of sex for salein this cohens tribute i found myself suffering and suffering through pitiful tributes and awful reinterpretations all of them entirely lacking the original irony of the master and if truth be told several of these singers sounded as if they had been recruited at some asylum talent show its cohen doing a tribute to them by letting them sing his material really not the other way around: they may have been friends or his daughters he could have become very tender-hearted and in the mood for a gift too bad it didnt stay in the familyfortunately but only at the very end cohen himself performed his majestic tower of song but even that flower was spoiled by the totally incongruous background of the u2 all of them carrying the expression that bored kids have when they visit their poor grandpa at the nursing homea sad show really and sadder if you truly love cohen as i do<SEP>0
this was the first of panahis films that i have seen i saw it at melbourne film festival i was totally absorbed by the different characters that he creates and how differently they react and behave compared to aussie kids and yet on other levels how similarly i think perhaps if more people could see movies like this they could see people as individuals and avoid racism that can often be fueled by the fear of the unknown there are the obvious large political differences between oz culture and iranian culture but i found the more subtle differences between the characters that this film fleshes out so successfully on screen extremely fascinating there are idiosyncrasies in the characters that seem to me so unique i found it made the characters compelling viewing<SEP>1
after watching the trailer i was surprised this movie never made it into theaters so i ordered the bluray i had a great time watching it and have to say that this movie is better than some major animation movies out there of course it has its flaws but i can still really recommend it the animation is well done very entertaining and unique and the story kept me watching it all the way to the end some of the backdrops are just drop-dead gorgeous and you can see the french talent behind it i thought that forest whitakers performance feels a bit lifeless but that is how the character lian-chu is depicted in this movie so overall thumbs up i liked it a lot and i hope it is successful enough for all the studios involved to continue making great movies like this i would recommend to give it a chance and be surprised how great a movie can be with such a small budget hektor alone is worth watching the movie since some of his moments are stitch-like hilarious<SEP>1
steve carell has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy first on the daily show and then in various supporting roles in virgin carell has found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths carell plays andy stitzer a middle aged man living a quiet lonely life andy is a little odd but in an awkward nice guy sort of way one night while socializing with his co-workers for the first time andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin his co-workers david paul rudd jay romany malco and cal seth rogen initially tease andy about his situation but its clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being that andy is and they resolve to help him out by assisting him in ending his virginity and so begins andys quest into adulthood andy is the quintessential innocent and the bulk of the humor derives from his naiveté to the situations he finds himself in throughout the film some of the humor is crude gross out stuff but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy in addition i found some parts of the film actually pretty touching as andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life im not trying to portray the movie as a love story or a drama; its a rolling in your seats comedy still every good comedy i have ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the characters a good comparison would be the wedding crashers from earlier this summer virgin has a similar humor but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes i particularly loved the ending of the film which i thought was a perfect way to end the flick without giving anything away it reminded me of something about mary very light and fun; it leaves you laughing and smiling which is exactly how you should feel when you finish a comedy i would highly recommend<SEP>1
i wish spike lee had chosen a different title for his film summer of sam conveys the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer david berkowitz its not its a gritty earthy portrait of nyc street life during the hot summer of 77 when berkowitz terrorized that citythe film follows several young fictional characters in an italian-american neighborhood and their reactions to the son of sam threat theres vinny and his wife dionna; theres richie and ruby and several other charactersthe problem is that these characters are not likable they are routinely annoying and at times unbearable lee then belabors their high energy chaotic lives which are filled with anger lust and general turmoil there are at least two protracted fight scenes between vinny and his wife redundant disco dance scenes countless gabfests over and over i kept wondering: wheres the film editormeanwhile with all that bulk the film passes up the chance to convey any real sense of fear or dread arising from the son of sam menace which is too much in the background lee is more successful at showing a different kind of menace that arising from neighborhood vigilante groupsthe acting is uniformly good that combined with 70s disco music and lavish attention to costumes and production design make you really feel like you are in an italian-american neighborhood in nyc in 1977the films atmospheric authenticity however is not nearly enough to offset a rambling overblown script about the lives of grossly irritating people<SEP>0
i was babysitting a family of three small children for a night and their mother gave me this to show for them having just grabbed it at wal-mart earlier in the week all three children actually got physically ill while watching it im pretty sure it was the pizza they ate or something they all had picked up from school but really it could have been this film absolutely disgusting how any one can produce this caliber of trash is beyond me fortunately i turned off the film when i noticed the children were not responding and acting strangely for any parents out there i strongly advise you to refrain from letting young children view this movie<SEP>0

the author of numerous novels plays and short stories w somerset maugham 1874-1965 was considered among the worlds great authors during his lifetime and although his reputation has faded over the years his work continues to command critical respect and a large reading public published in 1944 the razors edge is the tale of a world war i veteran whose search for spiritual enlightenment flies in the face of shallow western values it was maughams last major novel--and it was immensely popular given that the novels conflicts are internalized spiritual and philosophical issues it was also an extremely odd choice for a film version--but darryl f zannuck of 20th century fox fell in love with the book and snapped up the screen rights shortly after publicationaccording to film lore the razors edge was to be directed by the legendary george cukor from a screenplay by maugham himself--and it does seem that maugham wrote an adaptation when the film went into production however cukor was replaced by edmund goulding a director less known for artistic touch than a workman-like manner and the maugham script was replaced with one by lamar trotti the author of such memorable screenplays as the oxbow incident tyrone power recently returned from military service during world war ii was cast as the spiritually conflicted larry darrell; gene tierney one of the great beauties of her era was cast as socialite isabell bradley the supporting cast was particularly notable including herbert marshall anne baxter clifton webb lucille watson and elsa lanchester both budget and shooting schedule were lavish and when the film debuted in 1946 it was greatly admired by public and critics alikebut time has a way of putting things into perspective seen today the razors edge is indeed a beautifully produced film--but that aside the absolute best one can say for it is that it achieves a fairly consistent mediocrity as in most cases the major problem is the script although it is reasonably close to maughams novel in terms of plot it is noticeably off the mark in terms of character and it completely fails to capture the fundamental issues that drive the story we are told that larry is in search of enlightenment; we are told that he receives it; we are told he acts on it--but in spite of the occasional and largely superficial comment we are never really told anything about the spiritual artistic philosophical and intellectual processes behind any of it we are most particularly never told anything significant about the nature of the enlightenment itself it has the effect of cutting off the story at its kneeswe are left with the shell of maughams plot which centers on the relationship between larry and isabell a woman larry loves but leaves due to the growing ideological riff that opens up between them tyrone power and gene tierney were more noted for physical beauty than talent but both could turn in good performances when they received solid directorial and script support unfortunately that does not happen here; they are extremely one-note and power is greatly miscast to boot fortunately the supporting cast is quite good with herbert marshall clifton webb and lucille watson particularly so; the then-famous performance by anne baxter however has not worn as well as one would hopewith a running time of just under two and a half hours the film also feels unnecessarily long there is seemingly endless cocktail party-type banter and indeed the entire india sequence which reads as faintly hilarious would have been better cut entirely--an odd situation for this is the very sequence intended as the crux of the entire film regardless of the specific scene it all just seems to go on and on to no actual pointas for the dvd itself the film has not been remastered but the print is extremely good and while the bonus package isnt particularly memorable neither is noticeably poor when all is said and done i give the razors edge four stars for production values and everyones willingness to take on the material--but frankly this a film best left power and tierney fans who will enjoy it for the sake of the stars and those whose ideas about spiritual enlightenment are as vague as the film itselfgft amazon reviewer<SEP>0
please save your money and go see something else this movie was such piece of crap i didnt want to go but i had to so i thought id laugh at least once nope not a single laugh it was that horrible! chris kattan will never get a good comedy role after this and a night at the roxbury this movie is completely obvious has no smart humor at all and just repeats itself over and over again listen to me and stray as far away from this movie as you possibly can!<SEP>0
page 3 is a great movie the story is so refreshing and interesting not once throughout the movie did i find myself staring off into space konkana sen did a good job in the movie although i think someone with more glamour or enthusiasm would have been better but she did do a great job all the supporting actors were also very good and helped the movie along boman irani did a great job there is one thing that stands out in this movie the story it is great and very realistic it doesnt beat around the bush it is very straight forward in sending out its message i think more movie like this should be made i am sick of watching the same candy floss movies over and over they are getting hard to digest now everyone should watch page 3 it is a great film -just my 2 cents :<SEP>1
this film is not morbid nor is it depressing it -is- sad because aids in the early 90s -was- sad but its real message is one of love and perseverancemark and tom were in a long-term loving relationship their devotion to each other is evident right away and as the ravages of aids escalate and become the focal point of their lives you see strength and commitment that are truly heartwarmingwhen silverlake life was originally released i was deeply involved in hivaids education and health care volunteering as a counselor at an hivaids clinic the film spoke to me like no other aids film of its day could because mark and tom were real people living the very experiences that i saw on a daily basis in real life i knew from firsthand experience what it was like to watch aids eat away at formerly vibrant young healthy people; seeing it happen to mark and tom in the film was very much like watching my real-life friends deteriorate it touched me in a way that even all these years later still affects me<SEP>1
the premise is ridiculous the characters unbelievable the dialogue trite and the ending absurd believe me im a fan of kevin kline but watching him do a pepe le pew accent for 2 hours as a supposed frenchman is not nearly as amusing as it soundsfor her part meg ryan is once again as perky and adorable as a take your pick: kewpie doll baby puppy kitten whatever you happen to think is the cutest creature on earth she also bears not the slightest resemblance to a real human beingthis movie strikes me as an opportunity seized by buddies lawrence kasdan and kline to vacation in paris and the south of france while being well-paid for it so i cant really blame them<SEP>0

this movie commits what i would call an emotional rape on the viewer the movie supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics in cannes but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to get himself noticed hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence drug abuse or juvenile delinquency or any other issue for that matterthe main characters metamorphosis from good but troubled boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent whereas the rape scene being an over-dragged exaggerated version of the rape scene from a clockwork orange is unbearable and i refuse to comment on its aesthetic values there are some things an artist should not do to try and achieve hisher goal at least in my opinionto wrap it up: shockingly brutal revolting and not worth your time see a clockwork orange or le pianiste instead<SEP>0

midnight cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in 1969 drawing an x rating by todays standards it would be hard pressed to pull an r rating jon voight who has been better is competent in his role as joe buck an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in new york city he meets a seedy street hustler named ratso rizzo who tries to befriend buck for his own purposes the two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic as ratso dustin hoffman simply shines hoffman has often been brilliant but never more so than in this portrayal he is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison losing the academy award to john wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences director schlessinger has a deft hand with his production but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer worth seeing for hoffmans performance alone<SEP>1
like his earlier film in a glass cage agustí villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor this is one of the most visually accomplished and haunting pictures one could ever see the heightened drama intensity and undertone of violence threatens on the the melodramatic or farcical yet never steps into it in that way it pulls off an almost impossible feat: to be so over-the-top and yet so painfully restrained to be so charged and yet so understated and even the explosives finales are virtuosic feasts of the eye unabashed gorgeous and highly tense this film is simply superb!<SEP>1
this is a film that on the surface would seem to be all about jedgar hoover giving himself a a big pat on the back for fighting klansmengoing after indian killers hunting the famous gangsters of the 1930s fighting nazis in the us and south america during world war 2 and commies in new york during the early 1950s of course in 1959 we did not know about mr hoovers obsession for keeping secret files on honest americans bugging people like the rev martin luther king jr but worst of allhis secret love affair with his deputy directorclyde tolson if you want to know more about that subject i suggest seeing the film citizen cohn hoover aside this story of a life in the fbi as told by jimmy stewart makes for a decent but dated film vera miles as his devoted wife is also good but jimmy is the movie as much as hoover controlled production and always made sure the fbi was seen without fault jimmy stewart gave the film a human sidequite an achievement considering hoover was always looking over his shoulder the background score is also pleasant i have read recent online articles suggesting that this is a forgotten film jimmy stewart was one of the greatest film stars of all time and none of his films should be forgotten tcm was the last network to show it a long time ago and i hope they show it again<SEP>1
i guess this would be a great movie for a true believer in organized christian dogma but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will rational thinking the separation of church & state and good science fiction it is a terrible joke!there are some well known actors who were either badly in need of work or had a need to share their personal beliefs with the rest of us heathensi was entertained by this movie in the same way i was entertained by reefer madness that movie attempted to teach drug education by scare tactics the same way this movie tries to teach christian principles with the threat of hell and misery for otherwise good people who dont share their interpretations of our worldit had me howling with laughter and at the same time scared me to realize how many people actually believe that our society should revert to the good old days of the 19th century!<SEP>0
i was rooting for this film as its a remake of a 1970s childrens tv series escape into night which though chaotic and stilted at times was definitely odd fascinating and disturbing the acting in paperhouse is wooden unintentionally a joke the overdubs didnt add tension they only reinforced that i was sat watching a botch casting exasperated the dreary dialogue which resulted in relationships lacking warmth chemistry or conviction as in most lacklustre films there are a few good supporting acts these people should be comforted consoled and reassured that they will not be held responsible out of all the possible endings the most unexpected was chosen lamer than i could have dreamtescape into night deserves a proper remake written by someone with life experience and directed with a subtle mind<SEP>0
i cannot comment on this film without discussing its significance to me personally as a child bad health prevented me from ever going to a cinema i first encountered movies at the end of wwii through roger manvilles splendid penguin book film which brought me so much pleasure as my health began to improve that i wish i could buy another copy to re-read today my introduction to many classics films such as the battleship potemkin drifters griersons magnificent documentary metropolis the cabinet of dr caligari and ecstasy; came first through this book and later at my university art-house cinema ecstasy had incurred the wrath of the vatican for condoning evas desertion of emil her subsequent divorce and the brief swim she took in the buff but roger manville ignored these trivial matters and discussed the film as a triumphant outstandingly beautiful visual paean to love - a view echoed by many imdb users a very lonely young man when i saw it i willingly concurred no further opportunity to see ecstasy arose until the introduction of home videos - by then it had become a treasured memory not to be disturbed quite recently i finally added ecstasy to my home video collection and found this assessment very superficial ecstasy is much more of a parable on the continuity of human existence against which individual lives are insignificant - perhaps a tribute to what bernard shaw in his aggressively agnostic writings used to term the lifeforce ecstasy portrays a young bride marrying a middle aged man whose sex urge is no longer strong disappointed she returns home and divorces him soon after she experiences a strong mutual attraction to a young virile man she meets whilst out horse riding she makes love for the first time and it is an overwhelming experience her former husband cannot face rejection and gives the young man a lift in his car intending that a passing train will kill them both on a level crossing but the train stops in time and the apparently ill driver is taken to recuperate at a nearby hotel where he later commits suicide by shooting himself after these exciting climacteric sequences a bland predictable and almost inevitable ending emphasises that whilst individual human lives exhibit both joy and tragedy collectively life continues to carry us all forward in its stream and only through contributing to this stream can we be truly happy this story is trite the acting is no more than adequate; and normally such a film would have disappeared into the garbage as did most of its contemporaries long ago what has given ecstasy its classic status is exceptional cinematography a continuous lyrical score and very careful loving direction coupled with something fortuitous but in cinematographic terms very important - it appeared just after the introduction of sound and was probably planned as a silent film it is sub-titled and its director has exploited the impact of brief verbal sequences accompanying some sub-titles and occasionally breaking into the score which so lovingly carries the film forward this makes it not only almost unique but extremely rewarding to watch the parable in the tale is stressed continuously but so subtly that only when reflecting after viewing does one become fully aware of it for example the names - eva and adam; the obsessive behavior of emil on his wedding night which shows that triviata have become the most important thing in his life and predicate his eventual suicide since he has no adequate purpose to sustain him; the ongoing series of beautiful sequences showing erotic imagery a bee pollinating a flower a key entering a lock a breaking necklace during evas virginal lovemaking sequence with adam etc; and the final post-suicide sequences which could have been filmed in many different ways but serve to extol the importance to individuals of performing some type of work that contributes positively to society as well as of creating new life to sustain this society after we ourselves pass on as a 1933 film i would rate this at 9 - even comparing it with contemporary works i would not reduce this below 8 for me the film will always remain a must see although you may feel that my background remarks above indicate some bias in this judgment unfortunately in north america contemporary assessments of this film have been distorted by the extreme 1930s reaction to hedy kieslers very brief and relatively unimportant nude scene which she had difficulty living down in hollywood some critics who have clearly not seen such classic films as hypocrites hula back to gods country bird of paradise or some of the early works of dw griffiths and cb demille have even erroneously referred to this as the first appearance of a nude actress in a feature film this scene was probably part of the original novel and the film would have been very little different if the director had chosen to rewrite ittwo further thoughts; firstly this is a czech film released there in 1933 its final message about hard work generating positive benefits for society must have seemed very superficial to its viewers when a few years later their country became the first victim of nazi oppression and was virtually destroyed for at least two generations i do not remember these sequences being screened just after the war when i first saw this film - were they removed from the copy i saw then secondly for me its main message today is that things of real beauty are often very transitory even though their memory may stay with one for a lifetime we should all be thankful that today some of them can be captured on camera and viewed again at our convenience<SEP>1
i laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt ben affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy jack black in this role gandolfini gives his typical a performance the entire cast is funny the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome i went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why i was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy can identify with loneliness during the holidays andor putting up with the relatives the best part to this film to me anyway were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped namely the scene involving the lighting of the christmas tree go see it and have a good laugh!<SEP>1
please dont rent or even think about buying this moviethey dont even have it available at the red box to rent which would cost a $1 & i think its worth less than thatthe main reason why i rented this d movie was because jenna jameson is in the movie lol between 2-5 mini will give credit that the movie had hot chicks and quite a bit of nudity but other than that you might as well buy another d horror movie that has the same thing with nobody you knowginger lynn has more acting time in this movie than jenna & shes not even on the front cover of the movie nor her namei recommend people to watch zombie strippers because you see jenna almost throughout the whole movie & nude most of the timethis movie is a big disappointment & such a huge waste of time<SEP>0
somewhere id read that this film is supposed to be a comedy after seeing it id call it anything but the point of this movie eludes me the dialogue is all extremely superficial and absurd many of the sets seemed to be afterthoughts and despite all the nudity and implied sexual content theres nothing erotic about this filmall leaving me to wonder just what the heck this thing is about! the title premise could have been the basis for a fun if politically incorrect comedy instead were treated to cheap amateurish unfinished sketches and depravity and weirdness for its own sake if i want that ill go buy a grace jones cd<SEP>0
the dubbingtranslation in this movie is downright hilarious and provides the only entertainment in this otherwise dull and derivative zombie flick i havent laughed so hard in my life as i just did watching zombi 3 and ive seen some really bad dubbing in my life believe me seriously the filmmakers could re-edit this movie and release it as a comedy and make millions of dollars its just that funnybut if falling off your couch laughing at the dubbing in a fulci zombie movie isnt your cup of tea then avoid this at all costs<SEP>0
im going to say first off that i have given this film a 3 out of 10 after some thought i was going to give it a straight out 1 but it got a couple extra points for the body count but that would be about it let me explain i paid literally £1 for this dvd in a supermarket because i tend to have a lot of faith in bargain horror flicks b-movies especially but if this film was aiming for b status as i suspect it was for a number of reasons which ill touch on in a sec then it failed magnificently not only did it shoot for b and miss it landed somewhere around f this film had so many opportunities to be good and it pretty much failed on all accounts i say above that its likely this film was aiming for b status and it seems to try and achieve this by trying to blend humour with horror which can either be very good or very bad for example later freddy films dream warriors onwards are all about freddys style and nose-thumbing which works out great! but this film completely bombed in that respect because the times where they tried to inject humour were mostly just stupid i will admit though that towards the beginning of the film the humour was good in fact for about half an hour i liked this film and was prepared to congratulate myself on another good find but what really killed this film for me was the inappropriate kills for instance when satan smashes the cat against the board and writes boo with its blood using its body as a brush or when satan slams the door into the helpless disabled elderly woman now im not usually too against senseless kills in films-hey thats the point right but in those two cases i just found it grossly offensive and unnecessary to anything in the film-plot especially for me the film went downwards from then on one major bad point about this film is that i hated every character in it the kid dougie was just ridiculously annoying!!! im at a loss to explain how he could possibly write off all those bodies and people being killed in front of his eyes as a trick! i mean come on!!! i completely understand that to be in a horror film a character does have to be somewhat stupid like running upstairs when you should blatantly be running out of the house screaming for help but this kid took the biscuit! i wanted to kill him myself by the end of it! it was completely unbelievable and if i had to hear him say duh! one more time i was going to bang my head against a wall-because thats what watching this film felt like why didnt i just turn the film off mainly because i honestly believe an ending can sometimes redeem a film but i was wrong in this case the ending did not redeem this film it further irritated the hell out of me and was inadequate to the plot line i get it already! the killer is always going to come back dressed as someone else be welcomed into the house by the stupid kid and go on a killing spree again because no one suspects him in that costume! i get it! this film made me physically angry because it was so stupid! and if by some foul mistake you do end up watching this film watch out for the intestines frankly if that guy actually did have intestines that looked like that id be surprised he wasnt already dead let alone until someones rips them out and ties them to a chairin fact ill even go so far as to say that the only character i liked at all in this film was actually the killer purely because when his comedy routine worked it did work all in all the plot line of this film dragged anything that might have been good down why was the killer killing i dont know i can live without knowing who he actually was thats fairly typical but without some kind of motive - hell i dont know id settle for him having a bad halloween as a kid! -it just seems more than senseless just stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid in fact i hated this film so much that i specifically registered with imdb just so i could comment on it save your money save your sanity stay away from it!<SEP>0
umm i was quite surprised that someone actually gave this film high markslets face it tori spelling is not a great actress and this movie just proves the extent of her talent the movies plot was weak i bet the dork that came up with this concept was some perverted peeping tom if there is a good thing about this movie i would say its that tommy chongs daughter just for the fact that shes his daughter and then there is that soap-opera-ish male lead whos decent good looks somewhat make him attractive but ceases to help his dramatic abilities *why does imdb require at least 10 lines how many more ways can you simply say this movie sucks<SEP>0
this movie which was released directly on video should carry a warning label that it is dangerous to human health and may subject the viewer to terminal boredom it is yet another thinly veiled evangalizing rapture religious movie with the good guys the believers suddenly vanishing and the bad guys the non-believersleft behind its an interesting concept especially since we see it happen on a flight captained by a non-believer who is having a sinful affair with a stewardess aboard needless to say that sinner doesnt disappear either! unhappily with all the pilots being non-believers the plane did not crash or the movie would have been mercifully over though this could have be interesting without the heavy religious browbeating as a whole the plodding movie makes one gag the acting is horrible and the obviously computer-generated simulations are very fake looking plus its yet another movie shot in canada that purports to be new york city spare meill just read the bible<SEP>0
i watched this on the tube last night the actors involved first caught my attention the first scenes were attention getters some funny some sad good character development i felt that the latter third of the film diverged if it was not for the early part of the movie i would have stopped watching i kept watching wanting to how how it tied togetherunfortunately i feel that it never happened i especially did not like the extend period that several of the character were talking yiddish was that the other shoewould i recommend no i think not as other reviewers mention much of the slang is dated 60s jive but it was not too distracting the ending totally turned me off<SEP>0
52-pick up never got the respect it should have it works on many levels and has a complicated but followable plot the actors involved give some of their finest performances ann-margret roy scheider and john glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayals notable too are vanity who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she shows and kelly preston whos character will haunt you for a few days anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this<SEP>1
this is probably the worst movie i have ever seen yes its even worse than dungeons and dragons and any film starring kevin costnerchris rock looked very uncomfortable throughout this whole film and his supporting actors didnt even look like they were trying to act chris rock is a wonderful stand-up comedian but he just cant transfer his talent to this film which probably only has two strained laughs in the whole pictureif you havent watched this film yet avoid it like the plague go do something constructive and more interesting like watching the weather channel or watching paint dry on a brick wallfor chris efforts i give it a 210!<SEP>0
i took my 19 year old daughter with me to see this interesting exercise in movie making i always find it intriguing to get views and opinions from a different generation on movies especially as im such a cynic myself its good to get an unjaded opinion from someone who hasnt yet reached the been there done that approach to every movie she sees im pleased to say that we both really enjoyed it and regarded it as a successful mother daughter evening out far far better than going to see some brain dead chick flick which i gather is what we are supposed to enjoy according to the demographics eighteen directors were asked to produce a short piece about each of the arrondissements of paris a city i havent visited in 20 years but i wish i had they are loosely linked by joining shots and represent different approaches to love in the city regarded in popular culture as the quintessential romantic capital of the world some of the films work better than others but as other reviewers have said it never descends too far into kitsch some are funny some are sad some intriguing and some just plain puzzling im still trying to discern some deep inner truth to the flying tiger hidden dragon hairdressing salon some are just fun and perhaps shouldnt be assigned too much meaning the vampire and the tourist for example possibly my only criticism of the whole film is that it makes paris look too good it can also be cold wet foggy indifferent and miserable or in summer baking hot and packed with so many tourists that you feel like a sardine in a can queuing up for hours to see every attraction but im nit picking my personal favourite by far was the coen brothers film shot on the tuileries metro station and starring a perfectly cast steve buscemi as a confused tourist who inadvertently finds himself caught up in a lovers tiff absolutely perfect and very very funny without buscemi having to say a word i also perversely enjoyed the piece about the two mime artists which was probably the closest the movie got to being cutesy - that certainly teetered on the edge of kitsch but it just stayed on the right side rufus sewell and emily mortimer gaining insight from an encounter with oscar wildes tomb left me pretty indifferent and juliette binoche trying to cope with the death of her small son made me very very uncomfortable i thought both the bob hoskins fanny ardent piece and ben gazzara gena rowlands fell a bit flat but maggie gyllenhaal was good has she cornered the market in junkies i watched sherry baby last week but i felt the two social justice pieces for want of a better way of putting it worked very well by that i mean first of all the film about the young mother leaving her own child in a day care to go and look after someone elses baby across town and then the film about the african migrant struggling to exist on the margins of an indifferent society who is stabbed and dies in the street in front of a young new paramedic yet another murder statistic in a world which sees thousands of migrants dying in the struggle to reach what they see as a better life every year i thought both pieces very well observedthe final film 14th arrondissement in which margo martindale plays a postal worker from colorado recounting the story of her first trip to paris  in very badly accented french  to her night school french class moved me a perfect ending to a good intriguing if not quite great movie paris je taime was an ambitious idea but it works pretty well<SEP>1
this is a great british film a cleverly observed script with many quotable lines which captures perfectly what magic mushrooms can do to a man over a weekend as per usual phil daniels is excellent along with that most under rated of british actors geoff bell peter bowles with a joint hanging out of his mouth is a casting masterstroke and gary stretch with his brooding looks brings something strangely atmospheric to the piece although it seems to be billed as a biker movie i think it will find an audience outside of this purely on the premise that a lot of people have been there done it and got the t-shirt also a great original soundtrack with a blinding version of freebird this really could be a 21st century heir to the famous ealing comedies like the weed in the welsh fields: its a grower!<SEP>1
the various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used if ms pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offerotherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical canadian movies as other reviewers have pointed out canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get perhaps canadian movie producers are consciously trying to de-commercialize their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing - movies by definition are a commercial thing<SEP>0
the devil dog: hound of hell is really good film it has good acting by the cast including richard crenna and rg armstrongthe music is spooky and gives that devilish chill!i liked the effects on the dog and i think the creature itself looked really cool with its hornsfrill like part on his neck and acted really viscous!if you like horror films and havent seen the devil dog: hound of hell before and are able to find and buy this rare film then do so because its a good movie and i dont think youll be disappointed!<SEP>1
in a year of pretentious muck like synecdoche new york a film born out of charlie kaufmans own self-indulgence comes a film that is similarly hard to watch but about three times as important frownland is a labor of love by the crew the actors and the filmmaker shot over years by friends it traces a man who cannot communicate through his thoroughly authentic real brooklyn world the people that you see are a step beyond even the stylization of the mumblecore movement they are real people painfully trapped in their own self-contained neuroses unwilling to change unable the real world to them is their own set of delusions and because this is a film about people who are so profoundly out of touch it is very difficult to watch it is 16mm film-making without proper light money or any of the other factors that would make a film slick but its honesty can not be understated a fact that would cause a room full of people to dismiss it and for richard linklater to give it an award as he did at sxsw this does remind of films like naked or the best of the mumblecore it is a film that is not for everyone but one that challenges you to watch and grows on you the longer you think about it<SEP>1
as i watch this film it is interesting to see how much it marginalizes black men the film spends its time showing how powerless the most visible black man in it is save for an heroic moment for much of the film the other black men and dark-skinned black women in the film are way in the background barely visiblevanessa williams character was strong and sympathetic the viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her there are also some fairly visible and three-dimensional support characters who are light-skinned and some white characters of some warmth and dignity but 99% of the black males in this film are nothing but invisible men voiceless shadows in the background of no consequence such a horrible flaw but anything but unusual in the mainstream media<SEP>0
i just watched the movie i was afraid its gonna disappoint me i was rather surprised at the end though the american pie franchise is still in my favorite franchise movies of all times yes it wont be true if i say that i enjoyed it as mush as i enjoyed the original ones beta house along with the previous two pies definitely lost something that the first two pies hadit is not gonna become a classic as the first two already did but what the hell-it is still funny with a lot of good moments and i think it should be the first movie to pick if you wanna have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school beta house deserves 610 but i gave it 710 just for being another slice of pie<SEP>1
mechenosets is one of the most beautiful romantic movies ive ever seen the name of the film can be translated in english as the sword-bearer the main hero sasha was born with one exceptional ability: he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword which emerges from under the skin in his hand at first side he can seem one more foolish superhero from the senseless movie about unreal events and feelings but it is not about mechenosets he hardly can be even called the anti-hero i think he is just a person who lost the purport in his life and faith in good justice and love in his life he has never met someone who could understand and love him except his mother every his step is stained with blood; he takes revenge on everybody for his gift which became a damnation for him and suddenly he meets her she doesnt need the idle talks and explanations she loves him for what he is she doesnt care what he did the fact that hes next to her is more important than anything else but soon she finds out his secret: he kills two people her ex-boyfriend and his bodyguard to protect her before her very eyes even after that she couldnt escape her feelings they try to run but its hart to hide finally they have a serious car accident he is caged; she is in a mental hospital they dont know anything about each other but she believes that hell save her he surmounts a lot of obstacles but finally finds her they run again but they arent invulnerable she is wounded she needs a rest but police almost catch them he doesnt know what to do they drive into a corner and then his sword begins to cut down trees helicopter around them but there is no need for it because she is already dead in his arms and he is the lonely person in the whole world again<SEP>1
i watch this movie all the time ive watched it with family ages 3 to 87 and everyone in between; they all loved it it really shows the true scenes a dog has and the love and loyalty you get from a pet just beautifulits great for thoes who love comedy movies the tear-jerker movies or even just petsthe music is wonderful the animals spectacular the scenes truly thought out and the characters perfect what i liked about the characters is the true and nicely mixed personalities: shadow the oldest a golden retriever hes the wise one filled with the wisdom and mindset of any dog chance the american bulldog puppy is basically a puppy with a witty side the comical character; and sassy the hymilayan cat shes the real cat who shows what a real cat will do for their owner the real girly one<SEP>1
ahista ahista is one little small brilliant i started watching it and at the beginning i got a little bored since the pacing was slow and the main idea of one guy meeting a girl who is lost was not really new but as the film went on i started getting increasingly and gradually engaged by the film the fantastic writing and the charming romance the film was extremely simple and natural and after some time i felt i was watching a real documentation of one guys life theres one very good reason the film got this feel and its the fresh talent called abhay deol he is extremely convincing as the simple kind-hearted and struggling ankush whose new love motivates him to make amends and fight for a better life throughout the film he is presented as an ordinary mischievous prankster but also as a helping and loving person who like anyone else will do anything to protect his love deol portrays all the different shades of his character whether positive or negative naturally and with complete easeshivam nairs direction is very good his depiction of the life of people in the rural neighbourhood is excellent but what gets to be even more impressive is his portrayal of ankushs relationships with the different people who surround him including his friends and his love interest megha who he is ready to do anything for i also immensely liked the way nair portrayed his interaction with his friends loud and plump mother whom he calls khala aunty he likes to drive her crazy and annoy her on every occasion yet we see that she occupies a very special place in his heart and is like a mother-figure to him as evidenced in several scenes except for abhay the rest of the cast performed well though soha ali khan did not stand out according to me she was good and had some of her mothers charm the actors who played ankushs friends were very good as was the actress who played ankushs khalaapart from the performances the films writing was outstanding the dialogues were sort of ordinary yet brilliant and the script was also fantastic thats mainly because despite a not-so-new story it was never overdone or melodramatic and there were no attempts to make it look larger-than-life the films biggest weakness was himesh reshammiyas uninspiring music which was unsuitable for this film otherwise ahista ahista was a delightful watch and it got only better with every scene the concept may not be new but the film manages to look fresh and becomes increasingly heartwarming as the story goes by the ending was bittersweet kind of sad yet optimistic in short this movie really grows on you slowly and this can be easily attributed to the wonderful writing the moving moments the charming romance the realistic proceedings and of course abhay deols memorable performance<SEP>1
my favorite movie genre is the western its really the only movie genre that is of american origin and despite sergio leone no one does them quite like americansright at the top of my list of ten favorites westerns is winchester 73 it was the first pairing and only black and white film of the partnership of director anthony mann and actor james stewart it was also a landmark film in which stewart opted for a percentage of the profits instead of a straight salary from universal many such deals followed for players making them as rich as the moguls who employed themanthony mann up to this point had done mostly b pictures noir type stuff with no real budgets just before winchester 73 mann had done a fine western with robert taylor devils doorway that never gets enough praise im sure james stewart must have seen it and decided mann was the person he decided to partner within this film mann also developed a mini stock company the way john ford was legendary for besides stewart others in the cast like millard mitchell steve brodie dan duryea john mcintire jay c flippen and rock hudson would appear in future mann filmsits a simple plot james stewart is obsessed with finding a man named dutch henry brown and killing him why i wont say but up to this point we had never seen such cold fury out of james stewart on screen anthony mann reached into jimmy stewarts soul and dragged out some demons all of us are afraid we havethe hate is aptly demonstrated in a great moment towards the beginning of the film after stewart and sidekick millard mitchell are disarmed by wyatt earp played by will geer because guns arent carried in earps dodge city theres a shooting contest for a winchester rifle in dodge city and the betting favorite is dutch henry brown played with menace by stephen mcnally stewart mitchell and geer go into the saloon and stewart and mcnally spot each other at the same instant and reach to draw for weapons that arent there look at the closeups of stewart and mcnally they say more than 10 pages of dialoganother character stewart runs into in the film is waco johnny dean played by dan duryea who almost steals the film this may have been duryeas finest moment on screen hes a psychopathic outlaw killer whos deadly as a left handed draw even though he sports two six guns another person stewart meets is shelley winters whos fiancé is goaded into a showdown by duryea and killed her best scenes are with duryea whos taken a fancy to her she plays for time until she can safely get away from him guess who she ultimately winds up withthere are some wonderful performances in some small roles there aint a sour note in the cast john mcintire as a shifty indian trader jay c flippen as the grizzled army sergeant and rock hudson got his first real notice as a young indian chief even john alexander best known as theodore roosevelt in arsenic and old lace has a brief but impressive role as the owner of a trading post where both mcnally and stewart stop at different timesmann and stewart did eight films together five of them westerns and were ready to do a sixth western night passage when they quarreled and mann walked off the set the end of a beautiful partnership that produced some quality films<SEP>1
dr hackenstein begins at the turn of last century 1909 the dawn of modern medical science to be exact dr eliot hackenstein david muir is in the early stages of his rejuvenation of living tissue experiments dr hackenstein manages to bring a skinned rat back to life which confirms he has succeeded in bringing the dead back to life its now three years later & dean slesinger micheal ensign is round the docs house for dinner as dean slesinger & dr hackenstein eat they talk about hackenstiens experiments which dean slesinger has always been opposed to dr hackenstein shows dean slesinger his laboratory in his attic where he keeps the severed head of his wife sheila sylvia lee baker who died in an unfortunate accident & can telepathically talk to him christy botkin provides sheilas voice apparently dr hackenstein also shows dean slesinger a skinned chicken running around in a cage & explains that with the process he has developed he will bring sheila back to life the dean has some sort of seizure & apparently dies meanwhile sisters wendy bambi darro as dyanne dirossario & leslie trilling catherine davis cox plus their brother alex john alexis & their cousin melanie victor stacey travis are driving along near hackensteins house when they crash they seek shelter & assistance & arrive upon hackensteins doorstep dr hackenstein invites the four stranded travellers to stay for the night later on dr hackenstein is visited by two grave-robbers xavier logan ramsey & ruby rhodes ann ramsey who deliver a male body when hackenstein actually needs female parts for sheila dr hackenstein being the genius that he is decides not to waste the opportunity of having three young beautiful specimens available & starts to borrow the bits n pieces he needs to complete sheilawritten & directed by richard clark i was pleasantly surprised by dr hackenstein ill state right now that it aint brilliant by any stretch of the imagination but for what it was i actually quite liked it it moves at a reasonable pace even if it does tend to drag a little bit during its middle as things settle down the script tries to mix slapstick humour like a scene when dr hackenstein is trying to restrain melanie & she tries to gain the attention of his deaf housekeeper yolanda simpson catherine cahn by kicking out & hackenstein keeping melanie behind yolandas back who is seemingly oblivious to whats happening with a touch of gore but id say dr hackenstein is more of a comedy than horror in conception & feel throughout there are some tacky puns & sexual innuendo as well which are always good for a laugh dr hackenstein to wendy would you like to see my instruments as an example i also thought the scene when mrs trilling phyllis diller reports her missing daughters to the bemused detective olin william schreiner was a pretty amusing sequence going round in circles talking about why he isnt looking for them even though he has only just been told why the cell doesnt have a prisoner in it & that if he didnt find the cousin not to worry about it none of its flat laugh-out-loud but i must admit i found myself smiling on occasion & found the film as whole to be quietly amusing there isnt a lot of on screen gore a few severed limbs sheilas decapitated head some medical stitching & those skinned animals which are definitely fake by the way i liked the characters in dr hackenstein too which was surprise in itself the acting isnt brilliant but to give everyone credit they put some effort into it lots of exaggerated facial movements & some serious overacting means its never dull oh & the three birds in dr hackenstein are fit if you know what i mean technically the film is ok as well once again it aint going to win any oscars but i have to give the filmmakers at least some credit for trying to pull off a turn of the century period setting it doesnt always work the clothes are at odds with each other at times the girls look like their from victorian england while the guys look like their from a western the house looks as if all the filmmakers did was remove any modern object from the room & stick a few candles in there! it comes across as a little bit on the cheap side but it really isnt a bad looking film at all considering could have done without the comedy music though overall i ended up enjoying dr hackenstein much more than i thought i would although that in itself isnt a recommendation its certainly is not the best comedy horror film ever made & it certainly is not the worst either a watchable enough piece of harmless fun<SEP>0
after the success of scooby-doo where are you they decided to give scooby and shaggy their own show but unfortunately they added a new character that spoilt scooby-doo success forever they invented a new show with a new title scooby and scrappy-doo it was scrappy-doo that made this show a complete failure probably for both adults and kids together scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up scooby and shaggy were getting scared of the villain and they were also trying to stop him scooby-doo doesnt need any little annoying bastard puppy nephews if they wanted scooby-doo to be more successful they should have either killed or never thought up scrappy this was just poor maybe your kids will prefer it!<SEP>0
the jist: see something elsethis film was highly rated by gene siskel but after watching it i cant figure out why the film is definitely original and different it even has interesting dialogue at times some cool moments and a creepy noir feel but it just isnt entertaining it also doesnt make a whole lot of sense in plot but especially in character motivations i dont know anyone that behaves like these characters dothis is a difficult movie to take on -- i suggest you dont accept the challenge<SEP>1
i have been a fan of pushing daisies since the very beginning it is wonderfully thought up and bryan fuller has the most remarkable ideas for this showit is unbelievable on how much tv has been needing a creative original show like pushing daisies it is a huge relief to see a show that is unlike the rest where as if you compared it to some of the newer shows such as scrubs and house you would see the similarities and it does get tedious at moments to see shows so close in identitywith a magnificent cast wonderful script and hilarity in every episode pushing daisies is by-far one of the most remarkable shows on your television<SEP>1
i first saw this when it premiered more than ten years ago i saw it again today and it still had a big impact on me she fought alone is about a girl caitlin played by tiffani thiessen who is raped by jace played by david lipper a classmate who enjoys hurting girls caitlin is in a popular high school clique but when she reveals she is raped the clique turns against her led by ethan played by brian austin greenthis movie chronicles caitlins struggle against an entire town including a high school that essentially lets athletes determine the social environment allowing them to get away with whatever they wishthiessen and green are the top performers and there is real chemistry between the two of the them throughout the entire film all of the actors in this film which was inspired by actual events did a great job she fought alone really captures the essence of what it is like to be in high school at least in 1995 and having ones self-esteem and reputation at stake recommended 1010<SEP>1
i did not read anything about the film before i watched it by chance last saturday evening and then as i was watching it i felt the misery of lena and boesman into my bones i was so captivated by the acting and the tone and the filming that i listened only partially to the dialogues my husband fell asleep soon after we went to bed and i was sleepless under the impact of the film i wanted to wake him up just to say:if i would ever vote for an oscar nomination it would be for these two actors i decided to wait until the next day then i read more about the film on imdb and was sad to learn that mr berry died before the release of the film and that he had probably never seen the last version of his brilliant masterpiece i still want to tell him that to me his film was a true independent film in its concept and spirit the actors are to be praised not only for their brilliant performance but for accepting a part with no shine no showing off well to the contrary displaying the true image of human depression sad but poignant<SEP>1
this is definitely one of the best movies ive ever seen-- it has everything-- a genuinely touching screenplay fine actors that make subtlety a beautiful art to watch an actually elegant romance its a shame that that kind of romance just doesnt seem to exist anymore lovely songs and lyrics especially the final song an artistic score and costumes and sets that make you want to live in them the ending was only a disappointment in that i was expecting a spectacular film to have a brilliant end-- but it was still more wonderful then the vast majority of movies out there definitely check this movie out-- over and over again there are many details you miss the first time that deserve a second look<SEP>1
for the life of me i can not understand the blind hype and devotion to this totally unbelievable movieand i think i have the qualifications to say so i am a former special operations soldier with 14 years in the lifestyle this movie was totally totally unreal and obviously written by someone that did very little research into life in the army in combat or at a team or platoon levelthree eod guys trouncing around bagdad on their own get real no chain of command get real eod clearing buildings get realeod military intelligence sniper qualified buck sergeant get real wait i shot and killed a bad guy and then let two guys take me without firing another shot or being injured at all get reali carjack an iraqi civilian while i am only armed with a 9 mil break into another civilians house get punked by his wife then make it back to camp on foot in the middle of bagdad at night without as so much as a scratch or confrontation get realthere is absolutely no adherence to military protocol {army} and no resemblance at all to any army unit that i have even encountered totally unbelievable and disrespectful to the men and women of eod who contrary to this poor film are not wild adrenaline seeking yahoos but extremely qualified professionals doing an incredibly hard job<SEP>0
i have never observed four hours pass quite so quickly as when i saw this film this film restores the power and art to hamlet that it was always meant to have even those oh-so famous speeches are done in new and inventive ways and the cast is incredible brannagh the brightest star it is his charisma power and command of the role that defines the movie making it a full and complete version fills so many holes and allows for new appreciation of the tragedy despite the length where one would expect the dark gloomy cliched castle we are treated to a sumptuous feast for the eyes the only gloom comes from hamlet himself as it should well worth your time all four hours of it<SEP>1
now i have never ever seen a bad movie in all my years but what is with songs in the movie what physiological meaning does it have wow some demented pokémon shows up and they multiply i can get a seizure from this animie is pointless the makers of it are pointless its a big marketing scheme look just cut down on songs and they will get a good rating i reckon that this movie would have been fine if they put out a message you must see all the pokémon episodes to understand whats going on and it is not a film it is just an animation it should be on videops: ill give it a 1 because i just got 5 bucks i could not give it a half because theres no halves<SEP>0
our teacher showed us this movie in first grade i havent seen it since i just watched the trailer though does this look like a first grade movie to you i dont think so i was so horrified by this movie i could barely watch it it was mainly the scene with shirley mcclain cutting that little girl in half and then there was the boy with ketchup! i was freaked out by this film now today being 20 i probably would not feel that way i just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldnt see this movie even though its pg be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids i dont even remember what it was about once was enough!<SEP>0
i dont remember barnaby jones being no more than a very bland standard detective show in which as per any quinn martin show act i was the murder act ii was the lead character figuring out the murder act iii was the plot twist another character murdered act iv was the resolution and the epilogue was betty lee meriwether asking her father-in-law barnaby jones buddy ebsen how he figured out the crime and then someone saying something witty at the end of the showone thing i do remember was the late great composer jerry goldsmiths excellent theme song strangely the opening credit sequence made me want to see the show off and on for the seven seasons the show was on the air i will also admit that it was nice to see ebsen in a role other than jed clampett despite ebsen being badly miscast i just wished the show was more entertaining than when i first remembered itupdate 1112009: i watched an interview with composer jerry goldsmith on youtube through their archive of american television channel lets just say that i was more kind than goldsmith about the show barnaby jones<SEP>0
indian summer! it was very nostalgic for me i found it funny heartwarming and absolutely loved it! anyone who went to camp as a kid and wishes at times they could go back to the good ole days for a brief time really needs to see this one! it starts out as 20 years later a group of old campers returns for a reunion i wont comment on the plot anymore cause you have to see it for yourself the actors were great and it contains an all star cast everyone in it played a terrific role you actually felt like you were a part of the movie watching it alan arkin was especially good in his role as uncle lou he plays the kind of guy that everyone wishes they had in their lives this is also a good family movie for the most part i would suggest this one to anybody in a heartbeat! highly recommended!<SEP>1
worry not disney fans--this special edition dvd of the beloved cinderella wont turn into a pumpkin at the strike of midnight one of the most enduring animated films of all time the disney-fide adaptation of the gory brothers grimm fairy tale became a classic in its own right thanks to some memorable tunes including a dream is a wish your heart makes bibbidi-bobbidi-boo and the title song and some endearingly cute comic relief the famous slipper click for larger image we all know the story--the wicked stepmother and stepsisters simply wont have it this uppity cinderella thinking shes going to a ball designed to find the handsome prince an appropriate sweetheart but perseverance animal buddies and a well-timed entrance by a fairy godmother make sure things turn out all right there are a few striking sequences of pure animation--for example cinderella is reflected in bubbles drifting through the air--and the design is rich and evocative throughout its a simple story padded here agreeably with comic business particularly cinderellas rodent pals dressed up conspicuously like the dwarf sidekicks of another famous disney heroine and their misadventures with a wretched cat named lucifer theres also much harrumphing and exposition spouting by the king and the grand duke its a much simpler and more graceful work than the more frenetically paced animated films of today which makes it simultaneously quaint and highly gratifying<SEP>1
young erendira and her tyrranical grandmother provide for a great fantasy from the new world this interpretation of gabriel garcia marquezla incréible y triste historia da la cándida eréndira may not rub marquez purists the right way eventhough the story stays intact and still carries the full force of the work the strength of this film is in its acting especially papas as the grandmother marquez fans and marquez novices alike will enjoy this movie for its real gritty brand of witt<SEP>1
the acting is bad ham all the jokes are superficial and the target audience is clearly very young children assuming they have below average iqs i realize that it was meant for kids but so is malcom in the middle yet they still throw in adult humor and situationswhat should we expect from a show lead by bob saget the only comedian in existence who is less funny than a ball hitting a mans groin which is probably why he stopped hosting americas funniest home videosparents do not let your kids watch this show unless you want to save money on college expose your kids to stupidity and they will grow up dumberer<SEP>0
i felt this movie started out well the acting was spot on and i felt for all the characters situation even though the true family unit was not completely revealed we never got enough info on the father to truly feel his pain for his whole involvement or the build up for his animosity with tobe i mean in one scene you see him admiring her for tensity and in another scene he just about takes her head off another problem with the movie was it just unraveled and lost all focus by the end and i was begging for it to just be over with any movie with such a long drawn out and painful ending should never get an automatic rating of 7 or above just for the acting we are looking at the over all quality of the movie experience in the case of this movie the end is so bad i seriously contemplated just walking out of the theater this movie pulled me in then just spit me out<SEP>0
julia roberts obviously makes a concerted effort to shake off her cotton wool pretty woman persona with this spurious spousal abuse thriller but its hard to imagine shed end up putting in a performance as powerful and convincing and oscar winning as she did in erin brokovich based on the back of this rubbish and make no bones about it its nothing more than a julia roberts vehicle but unfortunately her performance is not the most lacklustre thing about itthe plot has all the markings of a late night made-for-cable and dont be under the impression that it will offer any insight into the dark world of domestic abuse because non of the characters are sketched out enough for you to really care ultimately disappointing and unsatisfying without roberts name above the title im sure it would have totally flopped deservedly<SEP>0
i grew up watching the old inspector gadget cartoon as a kid it was like get smart for kids bumbling boob cant solve any case and all the work is done by the walking talking dog brain and his niece penny i had heard the live action movie was decent so i checked it out at the library i rented this movie for free and felt i should have been paid to see thisbroderick comes nowhere near the caliber of acting don adams had as the voice of gadget his voice was all wrong the girl who played penny looked nothing like the cartoon penny she is brunette where the cartoon version was blonde with pigtails but she does do a decent job given what she had to work with dabney coleman gives a good performance as cheif quimby saldy he never hid in any odd place or had exploding messages tossed at him accidently by gadgetthe gadget mobile was wrong it never talked in the series and it did fine why did they do thisgadget was too intelligent in this film in the show he was a complete idiot here he had a halfway decent intellect it would have worked better if he was a moronalso the completely butchered the catchphrase borderick says wowser it is and should always be wowsers it sounds lame with out the s i got upset when they showed the previews and they didnt have the correct phrasethe only decent gags were during the credits the lacky for claw is in front of a support group for recovering henchmensidekicks seated in the audience is mr t richard keil aka jaws of bond movie fame a herve villacheze look alike oddjob kato and more this is about the only part i laughed atthe other is at the end where penny is checking out here gadget watch and tells brain to say somethin don adams voices the dog saying that brain isnt in right now please leave your name at the sound of the woof woof of course this isnt laugh out loud funny just a nice piece of nostalgia to hear adams in the movie he should have at least voiced the stupid carkids will like this anyone over 13 wont<SEP>0
this movie maked me cry at the end! i watch at least 3-4 movies a week i seen loads of great movies even more crap - ones but when ending scene - catharsic at its core - came i cried! and if you didnt - you have serious problems! the story is archetypal - nothing new or original but its real - because that sort of things really happened and that people really exist glam isnt my sort of music but i really admire all that they went through in early 70s at some point this directed me toward velvet goldmine! docudramas never really work very good but this movie really meked us believe it allbecause they dont try to make it as a path full of glorious concerts present musicians that are superheroes groupie girls that are stupid and emotionally numb they dont glorify drugs and alcohol they promote rehabilitation and redemption that comes even 20 years late once again great movie since leaving las vegas i was never so moved by a movie<SEP>1
why hollywood feels the need to remake movies that were so brilliant their prime the texas chainsaw massacre the hills have eyes but is it considerably worse why hollywood feels the need to remake those horror films that werent brilliant to start with prom night the amityville horror much like their originals these remakes fail in creating atmosphere character or any genuine scares at all prom night is so flat and uninteresting its hard to watch but for all the wrong reasonsits a poorly acted massively uninteresting and ultimately dull excursion that fails at everything its designed to do its clear hollywood horror is dead even the likes of the hills have eyes and the texas chainsaw massacre managed to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent plot prom night is virtually bloodless and im not even going to mention how bad the plot is its inability to seal the killers identify makes this the least suspenseful horror movie since erm the originalone of the most notorious slasher films of the 1980s returns to terrorize filmgoers with this remake that proves just how horrifying high school dances can truly be donna keppel brittany snow has survived a terrible tragedy but now the time has come to leave the past behind and celebrate her senior prom in stylewhen the big night finally arrives donna and her best friends prepare to enjoy their last big high-school blowout by living it up and partying till dawn but while donna is willing to look past her nightmares and into a brighter future the man she thought she had escaped forever has returned for one last dance an obsessed killer is on the loose and hell slay anyone who attempts to prevent him from reaching his one and only donnawho will survive to see graduation day and what will donna do when shes forced to confront her greatest fear scott porter jessica stroup and dana davis co-star in the slasher remake that will have tuxedo-clad teens everywhere nervously looking over their shoulders as they file out onto the dance floor a plot that will probably put you off going to see this witch if you ask me is a good thingwithout much to work with mccormick gamely tries to milk tension out of the most banal of situations at one point a girl backs into a floor lamp a lamp! and mccormick tries to pump it up into a jump-scare moment desperate times really do call for desperate measures there havent been this many shots of closets since the last ikea cataloguein the era of the hills my super sweet 16 and to catch a predator there probably is a freaky scary movie to be mined from the commoditisation of glamour and societys creepy obsession with youthful beauty this is not that moviemy final verdict avoid at all cost nobody will like prom night its even a disappointment to thoses who usually enjoy hack-job remakes considering its absolute lack of blood or frights a night youll be in a hurry to forget<SEP>0
this was a marvelously funny comedy with a great cast john ritter and katey sagal were perfectly cast as the parents and the kids were great too kaley cuoco was a good choice to play bridget who was sort of a toned-down version of kelly bundy from married with children the writing and performances were both first-ratesadly john ritter died during the series and it put a damper on things they had to scramble to change the show and bring in more cast members and it was obviously an uncomfortable situation but they handled it well james garner was a good addition it could have lasted longer had ritter livedi especially loved it when they brought in ed oneill in a guest spot that was great*** out of ****<SEP>1
i saw this in the theater during its initial release and it was disturbing then as im sure it would still be it was the first part of 68 and this was still making the rounds in towns across america and there had recently been a mass-murder in my hometown where i saw this where a man went on a shooting rampage the freshness of that close-to-home event combined with this dramatized true story made for a very disturbing theatrical experience it really brought to life the excellent acting of robert blake and scott wilson i was familiar with the novel based on the true event by truman capote and the screenplay and direction by richard brooks wove the event and trumans interpretation into compelling gritty cinematic adaptation music from quincy jones effectively scores its story ive only seen this a couple times since it was too real almost like being a witness to the crime itself and riding along with the killers i would give this a 90 of a possible 10 society is so desensitized to violence and crime today that this probably seems slow and tame and could be viewed with less effect but to anyone over 50 this will be a hallmark into the examination of the criminal psyche<SEP>1
from the beginning of the show carmen was there she was one of the best characters why did they get rid of her! the show not the same as before its way worsethe best episodes were with carmen in them you cant replace someone from the beginning! that is like south park without kyle or childs play without chucky! its not right! the niece who replaced her is just ugh! awful she doesnt fit into the storyline at all she was one of the main characters and the niece cant replace her she was an awesome actress way better than the niece get her back or youll lose a ton of viewers<SEP>1
the teasers for tree of palme try to pass it off as a sort of allegory for a fairy tale with actual meaning then immediately start raving about the animation i should have known what that meantthe main character palme is a good example of the whole movies problem one minute palme is a humble hero in search of himself the next a violent psycho with an unhealthy fixation on a girl he once took care oflike all of the characters in the movie palme is poorly defined you do not bond with the characters at all although shatta has acquired a couple of fan girls it seems that the writer was more interested in cramming all the drama and complexity he could into this movie than actually exploring his characters motivations and personalitiesnew useless story lines were being introduced in the last fifteen minutes of the movie the writer seriously needed to streamline his story perhaps he was trying to be epic but it was simply too much information for a two-hour movie however i cant help but wonder if a plot with so many dimensions and characters would have been better suited for a tv series or graphic novelin the last five minutes of the movie i simply could not endure the sheer lack of quality any longer and began laughing at how contrived the characters the relationships and the whole plot was i touched my companion and he started cracking up too as did a young man seated behind us we tried so hard to control ourselves but we simply could not take the terrible quality of this movieon the bright side the animation is incredible and viewers will find themselves admiring the lush backgrounds and charming character designs the animation almost guides you; when you dont care about the characters it tells you how to feel<SEP>0
moonwalker is probably not the film to watch if youre not a michael jackson fan im a big fan and enjoyed the majority of the film the ending wasnt fantastic but the first 50 or so minutes were - if youre a fani personally believe the first 50 minutes are re-watchable many times over the dancing in each video is breathtaking the music fantastic to listen to and the dialogue entertainingit includes many of his finest videos from bad and snippets from his earlier videos it also includes some live concert footageif youre a big fan of michael jackson this is a must if youre not a fandont like michael jackson steer well clear910<SEP>1
the monster from enemy mine somehow made his way into a small mountain community where he has taken up residence hes being hunted by a female doctor-turned-vigilante who is out to exterminate him this female assassin who looks like a refugee from a motley crue video rides around on a motorcycle and tries to save a bunch of kids who have chosen to have a big chill weekend right smack dab in the middle of the monsters turf decapitations and lots of blood are primarily in place to draw attention away from the story which limps along like a bad version of the island of dr moreau and yes its worse than the one with val kilmer<SEP>0
this kind of film has become old hat by now hasnt it the whole thing is syrupy nostalgia turned in upon itself in some kind of feedback loopit sure sounds like a good idea: a great ensemble cast some good gags and some human drama about what could havemight have been unfortunately there is no central event that binds them all together like there was in the big chill one of those seminal movies that spawned copycat films like this one you end up wanting to see more of one or two particular people instead of getting short takes on everyone the superficiality this creates is not just annoying its maddening the below-average script doesnt help<SEP>0
the year 2005 saw no fewer than 3 filmed productions of h g wells great novel war of the worlds this is perhaps the least well-known and very probably the best of them no other version of wotw has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as wells wrote it but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place: the last year of the 19th century 1900 using wells original setting in and near woking englandimdb seems unfriendly to what they regard as spoilers that might apply with some films where the ending might actually be a surprise but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world it seems positively silly i have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal works in english literature so lets get right to the chase the aliens are destroyed through catching an earth disease against which they have no immunity if thats a spoiler so be it; after a book and 3 other films including the 1953 classic you ought to know how this endsthis film which follows wells plot in the main is also very cleverly presented  in a way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late 19thearly 20th century photography although filmed in a widescreen aspect the film goes to some lengths to give an impression of contemporaneity the general coloration of skin and clothes display a sepia tint often found in old photographs rather than black colors are often reminiscent of hand-tinting at other times colors are washed out these variations are typical of early films which didnt use standardized celluloid stock and therefore presented a good many changes in print quality even going from blackwhite to sepiawhite to bluewhite to reddishwhite and so on  as youll see on occasion here the special effects are deliberately retrograde of a sort seen even as late as the 1920s  and yet the martians and their machines are very much as wells described them and have a more nearly realistic feel some of effects are really awkward  such as the destruction of big ben the acting is often more in the style of that period than ours some aspects of victorian dress may appear odd particularly the use of pomade or brilliantine on head and facial hairthis film is the only one that follows with some closeness wells original narrative  as has been noted viewers may find it informative to note plot details that appear here that are occasionally retained in other versions of the story wells description of the martians  a giant head mounted on numerous tentacles  is effectively portrayed when the martian machines appear about an hour into the film they too give a good impression of how wells described them both wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the martians from the limited perspective primarily of rural england  plus a few scenes in london involving the narrators brother the director is unable to resist showing the destruction of a major landmark big ben but at least doesnt dwell unduly on the devastation of londonthe victory of the martians is hardly a surprise despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machines the narrator traveling about to seek escape sees much of what wells terms the rout of mankind he encounters a curate endowed with the victorian affliction of a much too precious and nervous personality they eventually find themselves on the very edge of a martian nest where they discover an awful fact: the martians are shown to be vampires who consume their prey alive in a very effective scene wells adds that after eating they set up a prolonged and cheerful hooting the narrator finally is obliged to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate  who revives just as the martians drag him off to the larder cheers from the gallery; british curates are so often utterly insufferablethis film lasts almost 3 hours going through wells story in welcome detail its about time the author got his due  in a compelling presentation that builds in dramatic impact a word about the acting: dont expect award-winning performances theyre not bad however the actors are earnest and they grow on you most of them however have had very abbreviated film careers often only in this film the narrator is played by hunky anthony piana in his 2nd film the curate is john kaufman  also in his 2nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing the brother henderson is played with some conviction by w bernard bauman in his first film the artilleryman the only other sizable part is played by james lathrop in his first filmthis is overall a splendid film portraying for the first time the war of the worlds as wells wrote it despite its slight defects it is far and away better than any of its hyped-up competitors if you want to see h g wells war of the worlds  and not some wholly distorted version of it  see this film!<SEP>1
this was so far the worst movie i have seen in my entire life and i have seen some really bad movies i saw this movie at my local video store and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie little did i know that the cover would be the best part of the movie where to start the filming of the movie was scattered and boring at one point there is a one-minute scene of no one talking just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day nothing happened they just drove in silence the whole movie is boring with annoying unbelievable dialogue and basically no plot to speak of if you rent this movie watch it with some friends and it might make a good comedy otherwise when you see this movie run<SEP>0
terrible use of scene cuts all continuity is lost either by awful scripting or lethargic direction that villainous robot musta been a jazz dancer also one of the worst sound tracks ive ever heard monologues usually drowned out by music and whered they get their props that ship looks like a milk carton i did better special effects on 8mm at the age of 13!id recommend any film student should watch this flick 5 minutes at a time so as to learn how not to produce a film or was it the editors faultits really too bad because the scenario was actually a good concept just poorly executed all the way around sorry malcom you should have sent a stunt double youre too good an actor for such a stink-bomb<SEP>0
i got a free pass to a preview of this movie last night and didnt know what to expect the premise seemed silly and i assumed it would be a lot of shallow make-fun-of-the-virgin humor what a great surprise i laughed so hard i cried at some of the jokes this film is a must see for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor okthis is not a movie to go to with your grandmother jack palance or small children the language is filthy the jokes are very crude and the sex talk is about as graphic as youll find anywhere whats amazing however is that the movie is still a sweet love story my girlfriend and i both loved it steve carell is terrific but like the office the supporting cast really makes the film work all of the characters have their flaws but they also have depth and likability everyone pulls their weight and the chemistry is perfect i cant wait to get the dvd im sure it will be up there with office space for replays and quotable lines<SEP>1
normally i have much better things to do with my time than write reviews but i was so disappointed with this movie that i spent an hour registering with imdb just to get it off my chestyou would think a movie with names like morgan freeman or kevin spacey would be a bankable bet well this movie was just terrible it is nigh on impossible to suspend disbelief; i tried really i wanted to enjoy it but justin timberlake just wouldnt let me timberlake should stick to music what a dreadful performance - no presence as an actorno character cant blame everything on justin: the movie also boast a dreadful plot & badly timed editing; its definitely an fafter seeing this i have to wonder what really motivates actors i mean surely morgan actually read the script before taking the part did he not see how poor it was what then could motivate him to take the part money of course acting is at times more about who you are seen with rather than really developing quality work ll cool j is a great actor; he gets a lot more screen time than freeman or spacey in this movie and really struggles to come to terms with the poor script meanwhile the audience goes: what the hell is going on here you expect me to believe this crapin short apart from justin a great lineup badly executed - very disappointing<SEP>0
while i suppose this film could get the rap as being anti-vietnam while watching it i didnt feel that such was the case as much as the film was simply an honest look into the perspective of the young guys being trained for a war that the public didnt support it showed their fear their desperation their drive all of it out in the open naked as a soldier myself alot of the themes rang true to me in my experience in the military - especially boot camp on the whole this movie although it was shot on a very small budget looks great is very well put together and features excellent acting and directing i highly recommend this film to anyone looking for another excellent colin farrell film 1010<SEP>1
this film could be one of the most underrated film of bollywood historythis 1994 blockbuster had all of it good performancesmusic and directioni remember i was in allahabad when this movie was running and it was somewhere in march at holi time the people there were playing its song ooe amma at their loudspeakers in highest volume if someone who likes to watch some like it hot and drools over marilyn monroe he should see this moviethumbs up to govindahow many of you know that this film was shot in south of india and after sholay could be one of the very few blockbuter to hit silver screenwith films like these indian comedy could never be dead<SEP>1
i had high hopes for this movie the theater monologue is great and nic balthazar is a very interesting man with a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to movies i am a fan of a lot of belgian movies but this movie is bad its completely unbelievable that actors who are 34 are suddenly playing the roles of teenagers the linguistic games were hideous and over the top nothing about the film seemed real to me the ending was way too deus ex machina for mei am very disappointed and think i wasted an hour and a half of my life<SEP>0
i saw this film recently in a film festival its the romance of an ex-alcoholic unemployed man who just came out of a big depression and a single middle-aged woman who works in an employment office inem i found the story very simple and full of clichés taking the social theme of the movie and turn it in to a romance comedy the lead actor did a good job he definitely looks like an alcoholic man but ana belen is not believable as a working class woman she looks acts and talks very much like a high-standing woman what i mean is that ana belen plays herself she does it in all her movies anyway the whole mise-en-scene of the film was very poor the photography is ugly not using well at all the panoramic aspect ratio the dialogue sounds totally scripted and dull most of the times the comic situations are typical from gomez pereira but in this case they are not funny at all and are resolved poorly in my opinion this film is not worth watching only if you really love pereiras previous films you might enjoy this one a little bit anyway i walked out of the theater because i felt i was wasting my time the film-maker was by the door i wonder what a director feels like when he sees someone walking out of one of his films specially one that is made to please everybody<SEP>0
i saw this film its english title is whos singing over there at the 1980 montreal international film festival it won raves then and disappeared a terrible shame it is brilliant sublime ridiculous sad and extremely funny the script is a work of art its been 19 years and ive seen only a handful of comedies or any other genre for that matter that can match its originality<SEP>1

this is without a doubt the most offensive chick flick i have seen in years if not ever the writing & characterizations are so riddled with stereotypes that the film verges on parody before walking out of the theater an hour and five minutes into this disaster we were subjected to the following themes: having a baby will solve all of your problems performer types are miserable messes & musicians cant be good mothers unless they toss their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle what a waste of a talented cast & some great-looking sets & costumes when natasha richardson told toni collette that unless she lives a more mainstream life shell end up - shudder - alone! i felt queasy i cant believe this movie made it to theatrical release its the sort of fare one expects from those womens cable channels that i always pass right by when channel-surfing i am female and over 35 so i should be part of this films target audience but boy does evening miss its target<SEP>0
we do not come across movies on brother-sister relationship in indian cinema or any other language or medium this relationship has several aspects which have not been exploited in movies or novels typically a sister is depicted as a pile-on who can be used for ransom in the climax this movie treats the subject in an entirely different lightit is inspired by george eliots novel the mill on the floss the brother is very prosaic all-good the blue-eyed boy who is a conventionally good son and a favorite with his mother the sister is romantic wild and defiant of the unwritten rules of the society in spite of this the love of the brother-sister is the winnerthis movie is about the love of the two siblings who are separated in childhood and revival of the same feeling when they meet years later it is also the quest of the subdued brother to reunite with his sister who has chosen to be wild to defy the worldalthough the movie and the novel are set about 3 centuries apart in two distant countries yet the sentiments are the same and still hold true<SEP>1
i found myself at sixes and sevens while watching this one altmans touch with zooms in and out were there and i expected those devices to comment on characters and situations unfortunately as far as i could see they sometimes were gratuitous sometimes witty often barren for failing to point out some ironic or other connection in particular two zoom-outs from the gilt dome in savannah merely perplexed to be fair though a few zooms outs and ins to branagh heightened his characters increasing bewilderment a la pudgy mccabes or philip marlows on the whole the zooms were well inconsistent and sometimes even triteother almanesque devices such as multiple panes of glass between camera and subject succeeded in suggesting characters sollipsism or narcissism or opaque states of knowledge car windshields house windows and other screens were used effectively and fairly consistently i felt harking back to the player and even the long goodbye a few catchy jump-cuts especially to a suggestive tv commercial reminded me of such usage in short cuts to sardonic effectbut finally the mismatch between altmans very personal style and the sheer weight of the grisham-genre momentum failed to excite me this directors 1970s masterpieces revised and deconstructed various classic genres including the chandler detective film which this resembled in some ways; this time around the director seemed to have too few arrows in his analytic quiver to strike any meaningful blow to the soft underbelly of this beastly genre was he muzzled in by mammonist producers perhaps or am i missing something due to my feeble knowledge of the genre he takes on herenonetheless the casting was excellent all around: tom berenger for his terrifying ferality branagh for his deflated hubris robert downey jrs pheromonal haze robert duvalls method of trash and davidtzs lurking femme-fatality were near perfect choices all and except for a few slips out of georgia into chicago on the part of brunette daryl hannah accents were convincingly southernsuspense and mood were engrossing even if the story didnt quite rivet viewers the moodiness of a coastal pre-hurricane barometric plunge was exquisitely painstakingly rendered--i felt like yelling at the usher to turn on the swamp cooler prontotorn in the end i judged it a 7<SEP>1
utterly pretentious nonsense the material is dull dull dull and most of the cast wouldnt even have made understudies in allens earlier films and to have to listen to the unfunny will ferrell do his woody allen imitation makes me loathe the second-rate though mysteriously popular ferrell even more it appears that the morose 70-year old allen should have knocked off work when the clock rang in a new centuryi truly tried to get involved in the film but it was just impossible; my snyapses couldnt fire that slowly so rather than doze off and kill the afternoon sleeping in an upright position i got up left my wife and daughter in the theater and went out to the car where i had a really good book to re-read george baileys great tome of 30 years ago germans the day turned out pretty well after all no thanks to woody<SEP>0
the material in this documentary is so powerful that it brought me to tears yes tears i tell you this popular struggle of a traditionally exploited population should inspire all of us to stand up for our rights put forth the greater good of the community and stop making up cowardly excuses for not challenging the establishment chavez represents the weak and misfortunate in the same way bush is the face of dirty corporations and capitalism ran amok indeed latin america is being reshaped and the marginalized majority is finally having a voice in over five centuries though in the case of mexico the election was clearly stolen by calderon chavez is not perfect far from it hes trying to change the constitution to allow him to rule indefinitely that cannot be tolerated enough with the politics and back to the movie; the pace is breath taking at moments and deeply philosophical at others it portrays chavez as a popular hero unafraid to challenge the us hegemony and domination of the worlds resources if you think the author is biased in favour of chavez nothings stopping you from doing your homework one crucial message of the film is questioning info sources as was clearly demonstrated by the snippers casualties being shamefully blamed on chavezs supporters venezuela puts american alleged democracy to shame hasta la revolucion siempre!<SEP>1
no there is another !because every star wars fan had to have an opinion about i ii & iii and because that opinion was biased since we missed so much the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy i will state the good points of the return of the jedi and a few corresponding bad points of the prequel of course i loved the music the special effects the two droids but this has been overly debated elsewherewhat we get in the original trilogy and in this particular movie : - a strong ecological concern - anti-militarist positions - fascinating insights about the jedi order and the force - cute creatures - harrison fords smile - a killer scene : near the ending when vader looks alternatively at his son and at the emperor the lightning of the lethal bolts reflected on his black helmet and when he grabs and betrays his master to save luke thereby risking his own life ! oh boy !what is wrong in the prequel inmho : - the whole human factor element that the original cast was able to push forward is somehow missing - the force seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults than about wisdom - too many jedis at once and too many light sabers on the screen - the lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot by the way if you enjoy the theory of the force as explained by obi web obi wen i mean and yoda then you should read a few books about buddhism and the forms it took in ancient japanthe magic of star wars imho lies mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage from a master to his apprentice from a father to his son albeit the difficulties de mon âme à ton âme from my soul to yours as would write bejard to the late zen master t deshimaru<SEP>1
i have had the chance to watch several movies in bluray and hd dvd this movie stays to its wonderful action and great story although if you are looking for a movie with an excellent picture this one is not it not having this movie on dvd helped make the purchase easier i have always enjoyed the intense action and the excellent acting which dont always go together overall that is what makes this an excellent fun film to watch now on the blu ray scale in many blu ray movies you either get two things a picture that is almost crystal clear with no distortion or a movie with grainy hd picture i was disappointed when i made this my first blu ray movie i almost began to think that this was a blu ray standard although after watching other movies i know better i dont believe they spent as much time as they should have transferring this movie over to hd that is generally the problem with some movies and for the price of blu ray players and the blue ray discs you should only have the best picture so i only consider this a worthwhile investment for people who have either never seen the movie or have not bought the dvd version<SEP>1
this movie was so bad outdated and stupid that i had rough times to watch it to the end i had seen this rodney guy in natural born killers and i thought he was funny as hell in it but this movie was crap the jokes werent funny actors werent funny anything about it wasnt even remotely funny dont waste your time for this! only positive things about this were the beautiful wives : and molly shannon who im sure tried her best but the script was just too awful thats why i rated it 2 instead of 1 but its definitely one of the worst films ive ever seen<SEP>0
i havent laughed this hard at a movie in a long time i got to go to an advance screening and was thrilled because i had been dying to see it i had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie the audience all shared my laughter and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the moviekudos to steve carrellwho i had already been a fan of he proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy he has a style that i havent seen before and catherine keener is excellent as always thank god there wasnt a cameo from will ferrelllove him but saw him too much this summerthere were parts of comedic genius in this movie partly thanks to carrell and partly thanks to the writingalso carrell the waxing scene and the speed dater with the obvious problem were absolutely hystericali will definitely go see 40 year old virgin when its released my advice: go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it<SEP>1
i find it rather useless to comment on this movie for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment uponits similar to a rotten egg which has nothing good to show to the world excerpt for the fact that it is rotten as other endless number of eggs have been before it but since a comment is mandatory for such a grandiose insignificance filth is definitely the proper word to describe this movie created in the same manner as any other romanian movie directed by lucian pintilie who insists to depict the so called romanian reality following the communist era 1990 to present daysunder no circumstances recommended for people outside romania as for the others who lately find amateurish camera lack of plot lack of directorial actorss quality etc noise etc as being trendy and even art-like : watch & enjoy this movie as i know you will but do the other well intentioned imdb members a favor dont write an online review for it will misguide irritate and in the end waste their timeon the other hand this movie among others has some value whatsoever an educational one for it sets the example for : how not to make a movie<SEP>0
holes is a fable about the past and the way it affects the present lives of at least three people one of them i will name the other two are mysteries and will remain so holes is a story about stanley yelnats iv he is unlucky in life unlucky in fact characterizes the fates of most of the yelnats men and has been since exploits of stanley ivs `no good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather those particular exploits cursed the familys men to many an ill-fated turn it is during just such a turn that we meet stanley iv he has been accused falsely of stealing a pair of baseball shoes freshly donated to a homeless shelter auction by a famous baseball player he is given the option of jail or he can go to a character building camp `ive never been to camp before says stanley with that the judge enthusiastically sends him off to camp green lakecamp green lake is an odd place with an odd philosophy `if you take a bad boy make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun it will turn him into a good boy we learn this little pearl of wisdom from mr sir john voight one of the camps `counselors we get the impression right away that he is a dangerous man he at least wears his attitude honestly; he doesnt think he is nice the camps guidance councilor mr pendanski tim blake nelson is a different matter entirely he acts the part of the caring sensitive counselor but he quick quicker than anyone else in authority to unleash the most cruel verbal barbs at his charges the warden has a decided capacity for meanness but other than that she is a mystery these three rule camp green lake a place that has no lake it is just a dry dusty desert filled with holes five feet deep and five feet wide its local fauna seem only to be the vultures and dangerous poisonous yellow-spotted lizards green lake seems is in many ways a haunted placeholes works in spite of the strange setting and the strange story because it understands people specifically because it is honest in the way it deals with the inmates of camp green lake the movie captures the way boys interact with one another perfectly it captures the way boys can bully each other they way they can win admiration the way they fight with one another and the way boys ally themselves along the age line it is this well nuanced core that makes everything else in the film believable what is also refreshing about this film the good nature of its main character he does not believe in a family curse he is not bitter about the infamous exploits of his `no good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather in fact he loves hearing the story stanley iv is not bitter about the past and determined not let it affect him in the way it has affected his father and grandfather there is at times a lot of sadness in the film but not a lot wallowing angsty silliness and that is refreshingholes is an intelligent insightful and witty family movie it entertains and not in any cheap way it is not a comedy though it has its laughs it dares to be compelling where many family movies tend to play it safe and conventional as such it transcends the family movie genera and simply becomes a good film that everyone can enjoy i give it a 10<SEP>1
what boob at mgm thought it would be a good idea to place the studly clark gable in the role of a salvation army worker ironically enough another handsome future star cary grant also played a salvation army guy just two years later in the highly overrated she done him wrong i guess in hindsight its pretty easy to see the folly of these roles but i still wonder who thought that salvation army guys are hot and who could look at these dashing men and see them as realistic representations of the parts they played a long time ago i used to work for a sister organization of the salvation army the volunteers of america and i never saw any studly guys working there and that includes me unfortunately maybe i should have gotten a job with the salvation army instead!so for the extremely curious this is a good film to look out for but for everyone else its poor writing sloppy dialog and annoying moralizing make for a very slow film<SEP>0
this was a movie that i hoped i could suggest to my american friends but after 4 attempts to watch the movie to finish i knew i couldnt even watch the damn thing to close you are almost convinced the actual war didnt even last that long others will try to question my patriotism for criticizing a movie like this but flat out you cant go from watching saving private ryan to loc forget about the movie budget difference or the audience - those dont preclude a director from making an intelligent movie the length of the movie is not so bad and the fact that it is repetitive - they keep attacking the same hill but give it different names i thought the loc was a terrible terrain - this hill looked like my backyard the character development sequences the soilders flashbacks looking back to their last moments before being deployed should have been throughout the movie and not just clumped into one long memory to this day i have yet to watch the ending but there was a much better movie not saying much called border<SEP>0
fascinating downer about a would-be male hustler in new york city forced to live in a condemned building with a crippled con-man extremely bleak examination of modern-day moral and social decline extremely well-directed by john schlesinger who never topped his work here and superbly acted by jon voight and dustin hoffman packs quite a punch overall yet the fantasy scenes--some of which are played for a chuckle--are mildly intrusive as is the mod drug party the relationship that develops between the two men is sentimental yet the filmmakers are careful not to get mushy and this gives the picture an edge it might not have had with a lesser director than schlesinger originally x-rated in 1969 and the winner of the best picture oscar; screenwriter waldo salt who adapted james leo herilhys book and schlesinger also won statues ***12 from ****<SEP>1
my siblings and i stumbled upon the champions when our local station aired re-runs of it one summer in the 1970s we absolutely adored it there was something so exotic and mysterious about it especially when compared to the usual american re-runs petticoat junction green acres you get the idea it had a similar feel to the avengers not too much of a surprise since it was also british and in the spyadventure genrei would love to see it again now -- hopefully it holds up ive mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it so i began to wonder if id imagined its whole existence but the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it hopefully it will find a new generation of fans<SEP>1
im not sure how related they are but im almost certain that lost and delirious is a remake of this movie or the story that its based on very similar plotline and even some of the scenes and sets seem to be very very similar lost & delirious is actually a much better movie so see that one insteadthis one moves very slowly but being a late 60s french movie that is to be expected of the style told in a retrospect from the perspective of one of the girls revisiting the school the editing of the flashbacks with the current scenes is a little bit confusing at first particularly since the audio from each overlaps ie hearing flashbacks while seeing the present and vice versa also the girls are a bit old to think that they are in a boarding school finally not much character development to even get you attached to the movie<SEP>0
hollywood hotel was the last movie musical that busby berkeley directed for warner bros his directing style had changed or evolved to the point that this film does not contain his signature overhead shots or huge production numbers with thousands of extras by the last few years of the thirties swing-style big bands were recording the years biggest popular hits the swing era also called the big band era has been dated variously from 1935 to 1944 or 1939 to 1949 although it is impossible to exactly pinpoint the moment that the swing era began benny goodmans engagement at the palomar ballroom in los angeles in the late summer of 1935 was certainly one of the early indications that swing was entering the consciousness of mainstream americas youth when goodman featured his swing repertoire rather than the society-style dance music that his band had been playing the youth in the audience went wild that was the beginning but since radio live concerts and word of mouth were the primary methods available to spread the phenomena it took some time before swing made enough inroads to produce big hits that showed up on the pop charts in hollywood hotel the appearance of benny goodman and his orchestra and raymond paige and his orchestra in the film indicates that the film industry was ready to capitalize on the shift in musical taste the film was in production only a year and a half or so after goodmans palomar ballroom engagement there are a few interesting musical moments here and there in hollywood hotel but except for benny goodman and his orchestras sing sing sing there isnt a lot to commend otherwise the most interesting musical sequences are the opening hooray for hollywood parade and let that be a lesson to you production number at the drive-in restaurant the film is most interesting to see and hear benny goodman and his orchestra play and dick powell and frances langford sing<SEP>0
because others have gone to the trouble of summarizing the plot id like to mention a few points about this film there may be spoilers here; i dont care enough to filter them out- given the films low budget the creature design was quite good its actually nice to see a direct-to-video horror film thats not slathered with awful cgi unfortunately the digital film qualitys quite grainy in places and its most noticeable in the well-lit white halls of the asylum- ridiculous lighting design plagues parts of this film to say nothing of the variations in the passage of time i understand the director might have been trying to simulate dementia but in order for this to be effective consistent time flow needed to be established as-is it merely seems amateurish- plot twists were numerous but consistently predictable i neither had a doubt in my mind of the identity of the robed cultists nor of the fact that some kind of lame evil-trumps-good development would surface at the end- this may seem like quibbling but characters in this film reliably fail to employ any kind of common sense first of all regulatory commissions would be all over a mental health center that unilaterally declared all patient and employee deaths cardiac arrest-induced why would the head psychiatrist also be capable of performing autopsies why wasnt a plot point made of these impressive qualifications or of his introduction to his odd choice of religion whats the background whats supposed to make us care about anyone in this and just as importantly who in their right mind would go through the introduction to the place see everything that was so frighteningly wrong with it and then conclude that it was still a fine place to pursue a residency this film didnt even respect its characters enough to give their intelligence the benefit of the doubtbottom line: see the wicker man instead<SEP>0
jeremy northam struggles against a total recall clone script and disposable romantic by-play to bring life to a confused character lucy liu graduates her acting from a wooden start to a workman-like finish you cant fail to laugh when viewing her interviews on the dvd when she uses the term femme fatal and romance french film-noir actress she is not and they lack chemistry togetherthis movie fails not in the plot or the action sequences but in the lack of attention to detail in the films photography and ham-fisted portrayal of the world of technology surrounding the main protagonists little attempt is made to dress the scenery to represent any contiguous filmic landscape or period automobiles are very 1990s and the architecture barely modern with open plans that hint at a restricted budget rather than conscious set dressing techniquesthe technology is positively hilarious massive 2001: a space odyssey mainframes fed by man-portable cd-roms with data collected for some unexplained reason in spite of the proliferating communications network that even the most un-savvy technologist today would obviously be aware there is an obvious lack of research done here and given the open-source nature of the cyber-community research would have cost little more than a bulletin board and personal timedvd interviews also reveal the original movie name was company man but this likely ditched in order to cash in on matrix hype the cypher title has only the slightest link with the movie terry gilliam would have done wonders with this concept; and completely re-written the decaloguethis is tele-movie quality and extremely disappointing for a movie length production it might have made a good sub-plot for alias<SEP>0
i watched this movie also and altho it is very well done i found it a heartbreaker and would not recommend this to women who have small children the terror on this mothers face when she sees her child about to be run over by a train is truly heartbreaking and the sad thing is--internally she dies eventually she goes back to the applacian mountains all the money in the world which she makes from making dolls does not conceal the grief she has i remember her desperate face as she pulls money out of her clothes to try to have her child healed im surprised this movie takes place in detroit because when i watched it i thought for sure the people had come to cincinnati ohio this also was a route for the poor from the mountains<SEP>0
i liked this movie i remember there was one very well done scene in this movie where riff randell played by pj soles is lying in her bed smoking pot and then she begins to visualize that the ramones are in the room with her sing the song i want you around very very cool stuffit was fun energetic quirky and cool yes ill admit that the ending is way-way over the top and far fetched but it doesnt matter because it is fun this is a very fun movie its sex pot and rock n rocll foreveri read that cheap trick was the band who was originally to star in this but i do not know if this is true or not<SEP>1
imagine if you could bring things back to life with just one touch as soon as i first heard that my attention was locked on the trailer and after the first episode i found my self in love with this show a modern day fairy tale that brings my spirits up and holds my attention throughout the entire show i think the acting and casting is just perfect each character brings something unique to the show that adds to its perfection even the one time villains manage to overflow with a unique sense from the bee man to the guy who can swallow kittens they never seem to let me down and the deaths that would normally lead to a depressing moment often end up being purely comical such as an exploding scratch & sniff bookeven with the large amount of crime shows we have now a days daisies is one of the few that really stands out from the rest being not just a mystery but a love story comedy and a fairy tale with a hint of drama all baked into one wonderful pieerr showwhat really shocked me was the fact that it was on abc for years i never had a reason to turn to abc but this brought me back each week with a smile on my face it was as if pushing daisies brought abc back to life for me but just like that after two seasons a few awards a large fan base and positive responses from critics the show has been dropped it seems as though ned has touched abc again and forever killed it for me i will always be a fan of this show though and i recommend this to anyone who likes a lot of talking and a lot of love from the shows they watch<SEP>1
this is a very rare film and probably the least known from shirley temple as it isnt on any of her collectionsthe reason why is probably because it doesnt have a happy endingunlike all her other filmsits also not a musicalalthough she does belt out one song called the world owes me a livingthe film was made in 1934 and originally in black and whitethe version i have is in colour and on vhsi would say they have done a fine job as the colour does look realisticunlike i would say the colourised films of laurel and hardy which are dreadfulthe film is good for its age and the story hasnt dated at allim surprised no one has tried to do a remakeat times the film is a little bit to talky as some of the scenes with gary cooper and carole lombard seem really dragged out in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in fivealthough dont be put off by this because this film does have some genuinely good moments in itespecially when {jerry}gary cooper steals a necklaceand hides it in shirleys teddy bearthe tension and slow build up to his actions{while at the same time his daughter is singing to an audience in another room}is very well directedgary and caroles edgy facial expressions when they are put under scrutiny are also very goodin all this is a good film from the early 30saccept it for its age<SEP>1
it got to be a running joke around bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any cartwright men after all ben cartwright was three times a widower with a son by each marriage and any woman who got involved with adam hoss and little joe were going to end up dying because we couldnt get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic tv westernperhaps if bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the cartwrights people have relationships some go good some not so good its just life and were less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we dont have to kill the character off to keep the survivors nobility intact but thats if bonanza were done todaybut we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from nbc certainly helped the secret of bonanzas success was the noble patriarch ben cartwright and his stalwart sons ben cartwright was the ideal tv dad in any genre you want to name his whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense ponderosa spread for his three children the kids were all different in personality but all came together in a pinchthe cartwrights became and still are an american institution i daresay more people cared about this family than the kennedys just the popularity that bonanza has in syndication testifies to that pernell roberts as oldest son adam was written out of the show rumor has it he didnt care for the noble cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious perhaps if it were done now hed have liked it better in the way i describethis was just the beginning for michael landon how many people get three hit tv shows to their credit landon also has highway to heaven and little house on the prarie where he had creative control little joe was the youngest most hot headed but the most romantic of the cartwrights when roberts left the show kept going with the two younger sons but when big dan blocker left the heart went out of bonanza other characters had been added on by that time david canary tim matheson and ben cartwright adopted young mitch vogel but big loyal but a little thick hoss was easily the most lovable of the cartwrights his sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that familyso the cartwrights of the ponderosa have passed into history i got a real taste of how america took the cartwrights to heart when i visited the real virginia city it doesnt look anything like what you see in bonanza but near lake tahoe just about where you see the ponderosa on the map at the opening credits is the cartwright home the set maintained and open as a tourist attraction like 21 baker street for sherlock holmes fans the ranchhouse and the cartwrights are realand if they werent real they should have been<SEP>1
the movie is pretty funny and involving for about four dates then it becomes a blatant commercial for some guy you and even his friends really cant stand it is a pretty interesting concept; film dates on a quest to find true love in modern la the problem is that it feels incredibly and badly scripted at times and blatantly self-promoting it is difficult to care about and be drawn into any of the characters because the writeractor is so egotistical uncool untrue and simply unlikeable you end up feeling sorry for his dates<SEP>0
meek tiny almost insignificant polanski finds the invisibility of his characters and makes something enormous out of it in front and behind the camera he creates one of the most uncomfortable masterpieces i had the pleasure to see and see and see again it never lets me down people even people who know me pretty well thoughtthink there wasis something wrong with me based on my attraction or i should say devotion for le locataire they may be right i dont know but there is something irresistibly enthralling within polanskis darkness and i havent even mentioned the humor the mystery surrounding the apartment and the previous tenant the mystery that takes over him and naturally us me that building populated by great old academy award winners: melvyn douglas shelley winters jo van fleet lila kedrova for anyone who loves movies this is compulsory viewing one two three many many viewings<SEP>1
this film is excellently paced you never have to wait for a belly laugh to come up for more than about a minute and theres much more going on than the initial premise of the film throughout it there are mockeries of the traditional schmaltzy local-boys-done-good-overcoming-adversity genre of which this parodies dont let anyone tell you that theyre trying to get cheap laughs just by using obscenities;- sure theres plenty of that but its all contextual not gratuitous i loved this film and it only cost me £299 on dvd so in terms of entertainment value for money it has been the best film ive seen this year<SEP>1
well what can i say other than these people are super in every way i quite like sharon mcreedy i enjoy this pure nostalgic series and i have the boxed set of 9 discs 30 episodes i did not realise that they had made so many i also think that it is a great shame that they have not made any more i wish that i got given these powers imagine me being knocked off my cycle somewhere and being knocked out cold then waking up in a special hospital later on i discover that my body has been enhanced just like richard barrat these stories are 50 minutes of pure action and suspense all the way you cannot fight these 3 people as they would defeat you in all forms of weaponry the music is well written and to me puts a wonderful picture of 3 super beings in my mind the sort of powers that the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cats improved sight improved hearing and touch and the strength of 10 men for richard and craig and the strength of 3 women for sharon who i thought was beautiful and intelligent when i was a boy i had a huge crush on her!!!! now i can see why on my dvd set the box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet all about the series i also thought that trymane was a good boss firm but he got things done!<SEP>1
this is the funniest stand up i have ever seen and i think it is the funniest i will ever see if you dont choke with laughter at the absolute hilarity then this is just not your cup of tea but i honestly dont know anyone who has seen this that hasnt liked it it is now 17 years later and my friends and i still quote everything from goonie goo goo to the fart game aunt bunnie to the ice cream man ralph and ed to get out!! there are just so many individual and collective skits of hilarity in here that if you honestly havent seen this film then you are missing out on one of the best stand-ups ever take any of robin williams damon wayans the dice george carlin or even the greats like richard pryor or red foxx and this will surpass it i dont know how or where murphy got some of his material but it works that is what it comes down to it is funny as hellcould you imagine how this show must have shocked people that were used to eddie doing buckwheat and mr rogers and such on snl if you listen to the audience when he cracks his first joke or when he says the f-word for the first time they are in complete shockhis first time he says the f-word is when he does the skit about mr t being a homosexual hey boy hey boy you look mighty cute in them jeans now come on over here and f@** me up the ass!the crowd erupts in gales of laughter no one was expecting the filthy mouth that he unleashed on them but the results were just awesome i have never been barraged with relentless comedy the way i was in this stand-up in fact the next time my stomach hurt so much from laughing wasnt until 1999 when i saw south park: bigger longer and uncut that comedy was raw and unapologetic and it went for the jugular as did delirious i dont think it is possible to watch this piece of comic history and not laugh it is almost twenty years later and it is still the funniest damn thing on video i took your kids fishing last week and i put the worm on the hook and the kids put the fishing pole back in the boat and slammed their heads in the water for two minutes gus normal kids dont do shit like that gus then they started movin their heads around like this and the m****f***** come up with fish then they looked at each other and said goonie goo goo! i said can you believe this f****n shit!see it again and be prepared to laugh your freakin ass off!10 out of 10<SEP>1
heres a decent mid-70s horror flick about a gate of hell in nyc that just happens to be an old brownstone seems like theres lots of gates of hell around but of course this unwitting model happens to decide she needs some space from her boyfriendfiancée and so she just happens to pick one which is disguised as a nice and reasonably priced apartment she meets several strange neighbors and even attends a birthday party for a cat upon meeting with the realtor because she hears strange noises at night from upstairs she finds out that she and an old priest are supposed to be the only tenants whoa! then who are all these weirdos her boyfriend a slimy lawyer played by chris sarandon starts poking around and finds that things are not what they seem not by a long shot this has some decent creepy scenes and the idea of the creaky old folks that are her sometimes neighbors being other than what they appear is fairly intriguing a bit of decent gore and even a parade of less-than-normal folks towards the end make this a decent watch and while ive seen this many times on tv the uncut dvd version is much better of course not a bad little horror flick maybe a good companion piece to burnt offerings 8 out of 10<SEP>1
a damn good movie! one that is seriously underrated the songs that the children sing in the movie gave me a sense of their pain but also their hope for the future whoopi goldberg puts in a good performance here but the best performance throughout the whole movie is that of the actress who plays the title character i wish she was in more moviesthis movie should have a higher rating i give it a 1010<SEP>1

i wasnt quite sure if this was just going to be another one of those idiotic nighttime soap operas that seem to clutter prime time but as it turns out this is a pretty good show no small thanks to talented casting four female friends with diverse backgrounds get together and share the weekly goings-on of their love-lives the hour long program follows each of them separately through their often screwed up quests to find love and it does it without being boring or trite sharon smalls trudi is the homemaker one allegedly widowed after september 11th who gets a little preachy and annoying with her friends who tend to be a little looser and more creative in their endeavors its great to see small back on tv as she was great in the inspector lynley mysteries the chick can act orla bradys character siobhan a lawyer is perhaps the most damaged but still very sympathetic of the women as she wrestles with her kind but self-absorbed husband hari jaffrey formerly of spooks in his driven desire to have a child with her regardless of her needs the final two members of the cast are the effervescent jess shellie conn an events planner whos a wild child who sleeps with anyone and everyone gender not specific and katie sarah parrish a somber doctor whos affair with a patient and his son have sent her career and love life spiraling out of control that being said im hooked now and hope that the bbc continues cranking this series out because its good its different and its got a great cast<SEP>1
spoilers included this film surely is the best amicus production ive seen so far even though i still have quite a few to check out the house that dripped blood is a horror-omnibus an anthology that contains four uncanny stories involving the tenants of a vicious hellish house in the british countryside a common mistake in productions like this is wasting too much energy on the wraparound story that connects the separate tales peter duffels film wisely doesnt pay too much attention to that it simply handles about a scotland yard inspector who comes to the house to investigate the disappearance of the last tenant and like that he learns about the bizarre events that took place there before all four stories in this film are of high quality-level and together they make a perfect wholesome high expectations are allowed for this film since it was entirely written by robert bloch! yes the same bloch who wrote the novel that resulted in the brilliant horror milestone `psycho were also marking peter duffels solid and very professional debut as a director the four stories  chapters if you will  in the house that dripped blood contain a good diversity in topics but theyre almost equally chilling and eerie number one handles about a horror-author who comes to the house along with his wife in order to find inspiration for his new book this starts out real well but after a short while his haunted and stalked by the villain of his own imagination the idea in this tale isnt exactly original but its very suspenseful and the climax is rather surprising the second story stars hammer horror-legend peter cushing as a retired stockbroker still haunted by the image of an unreachable and long-lost love he bumps into a wax statue that looks exactly like her cushing is a joy to observe as always and  even though the topic of wax museums isnt new  this story looks overall fresh and innovating this chapter also contains a couple of delightful shock-moments and theres a constant tense atmosphere its a terrific warm-up for what is arguably the best story: number 3 another legendary actor in this one as christopher lee gives away a flawless portrayal of a terrified father hes very severe and strict regarding his young daughter and he keeps her in isolation for the outside world not without reason since the little girl shows a bizarre fascination for witchcraft and voodoo besides great acting by lee and the remarkable performance of chloe franks as the spooky kid this story also has a terrific gothic atmosphere! the devilish undertones in this story along with the creepy sound effects of thunder make this story a must for fans of authentic horror the fourth and final story in which a vain horror actor gets controlled by the vampire-cloak he wears is slightly weaker then the others when it comes to tension and credibility but that the overload of subtle humor more or less compensates that theres even a little room for parody in this story as the protagonist refers to co-star christopher lee in the dracula series! most memorable element in this last chapter is the presence of the gorgeous ingrid pitt! the cult-queen from `the vampire lovers certainly is one of the many highlights in the film her cleavage in particular no doubt about it the house that dripped blood will be greatly appreciated by classic horror fans i truly believe that with a bit of mood-settling preparations this could actually be one of the few movies thatll terrify you and leave a big impression intelligent and compelling horror like it should be! highly recommended one extra little remark though: this film may not repeat may not under any circumstances be confused with `the dorm that dripped blood this latter one is a very irritating and lousy underground 80s slasher that has got nothing in common with this film except for the title it stole<SEP>1
the first half of this movie is a pure delight novel funny wonderful performances a close knit brother and sister living in manhattan fall for the same woman! adult bright witty what more could you ask as a romantic comedy this starts refreshing it heads into unexplored territory and then it falls apartit goes from being a universal adult comedy to a coming-of-age coming-out-of-the-closet story that has been done many times before what a disappointment as a people film it begins with such promise why does it need to turn into such a pedestrian i am who i am film the freeze-frame ending shot of heather grahams jumping in the air to celebrate her happiness at finding herself underlines the banality of the last part of the filmit could have been different it could have been magical it ended up being the same old same old<SEP>0
i just finished watching the 139 min version widescreen with some friends and we were blown away i wont bother repeating what others have said what the filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun the huge battle is exhausting afterwards we were stunned to find there was still nearly 30 minutes left to go but that didnt keep us from being completely involved and entertainedthere is one thing that nearly ruined it and that was the horrific musicsongs blues countryfolk and rock ballads do not belong here and every time they are used we all broke out in laughter its hideous you have been warned but the story and storytelling keeps you groundedthere are several outstanding moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera there are many uses of silence as well as slow-motion photography that work beautifully i really wish i could erase the music but alasseek this out its fun its different and it takes you to places you wouldnt expect and thats very refreshing<SEP>1
okay let me break it down for you guysits horrible! if roger kumble did such a fancy job on the first cruel intentions then why did he do such a bad job on this im sorry but this movie is stupid true it may have improved if its series was ever aired but lets be realisticthis movie a crock! a lot of bad acting *note the shower scene* kissing cousins what kind of line is that slipery when wet can we say duh-m! this movie had effort ill give you that but it was too stupid! they even tried to make it funny by giving the house servants stupid accents which actuallywasnt funny! it was pathetic not to mention that they made everyone in the this one look absolutely nothing like the original cast its as if they made them look different on purpose or something! i like watching it when im really really really board which doesnt happen occasionally for those of you who did like itokay what were you thinking could you possibly choose this movie over the other one which had great acting and the fabulous sarah michelle gellar a movie is gold if it has sarah michelle gellar in it duh! but this movie doesnt no offense amy adams oh yeah since when does sebastain have a heart ugh!<SEP>0
this obvious pilot for an unproduced tv series features young canadian actress shiri appleby as an amnesiac with some pretty incredible powers that must be put to use when a man-turned-flying demon is let loose on the world the cgi is par for a tv job and appleby is ok as an amnesiac but hard to swallow as a superheroine familiar tv face richard burgi is along for the ride as applebys mentor but he can do nothing to elevate this dreck above the mediocre level we see way too much of the cartoonish flying demon right from the start a bad sign also the scenes where burgi is training appleby for battle are actually laughable they are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other movies most notably remo williams<SEP>0
i saw jack frost for £4:00 at my local store and i thought it looks pretty good for a low budget movie so i bought it and i was right it was good for starters this film is about a killer snowman so thats something to laugh about and the way it looks was funny compared to the snowman on the cover the acting was okay and the lines jack frost said had me laughing i only axed you for a smoke and worlds most pi**ed off snow cone how funny and camp is that the tale at the start was pretty funny and silly too jack be nimble jack be quick jack gouged eyes with candle sticks if youre looking for a for a b-movie comedy horror thats full of puns then check jack frost out 1010<SEP>1
if there was a 0 stars rating i would gladly hand it out to this absolutely horrid pile of waste the fact that the actual summary is perfectly fine and that if it had been made different it could have been brilliant only makes it worse the basic task of locking up a group of people in an experiment chamber is fine but wheres the experiment all i see is a bunch of unintelligent surfers and blondes chatting about music and culture i dont know or want to know about the challenges are pathetic and silly the whole point of reality tv is to show reality if you set a challenge dont make them play with exaggerated props of food and stereotypical cultural elements in friday night games make them do an actual challenge and as for earning prize money thats fine if they actually earnt it! these people are nuts if only they would make the show better the actual idea would be glorious but that aint gonna happen!<SEP>0
spoilers i guess the absolutely absurd logic of the ending ruins the entire movie i just couldnt get over it and what is wrong with mark wahlbergs character if i suddenly found myself crashed-landed on a planet full of talking apes id be all like aaaahhhhhhh!!! run for your lives! the monkeys have inherited the earth! but hes all like talking apes okay next thats pretty jaded id say he must run into even stranger things on a regular basis besides that this is rick bakers best work yet this film is a true testament to how far weve come in the monkey makeup field 310<SEP>0
outside of the fact that george lopez is a pretentious jerk his show is terriblenothing about lopez has ever been funny i have watched his stand-up and have never uttered any resemblance to a laughhis stuff comes across as vindictive and his animosity towards white people oozes out of every single pore of his bodyi have laughed at white people jokes from many a comedian and love many of themthis guy has a grudge that wont endi feel bad for hispanics who have only this show to represent themselvesthe shows plots are always cookie cutter with an hispanic accentcanned laugh at the dumbest comments and scenesmight be why this show is always on at 2am in replay<SEP>0
lynne ramsey makes arresting images and samantha morton can summon feeling with a gesture so what a drag to discover their talents wasted on this mannered pretentious lark ramsey cant bring callar to life her attempts are too arty and oblique repeatedly her camera lingers on long silent shots of the agonizing actress as if mortons obliterated gaze alone could supply character we are in a blank warholian hell of self-indulgence: for a film that has minutes to spare on bugs crawling across the floor you might think it could get round to fleshing out its protagonist but how will it do so if she rarely speaks without the novels interior monologue the celluloid morvern callar is nobody small wonder ramsey has morton undress oftenthat said the first ten minutes were so impressively acted shot and edited that my hopes were soaring give the film that much: it knows how to make promises if not how to keep any<SEP>0
atlantis was much better than i had anticipated in some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age although this film did demand a solid attention span at times it was a great film for all ages i noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure i think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies a lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies after a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching atlantis<SEP>1
shiri appleby is the cutest little embodiment of evil turned good girl demon-kicking buffy clone elle but im getting ahead of myself you see lilith was the first woman made by god as a companion to adam but she got all uppity evil feminist so god banished her from eden a clandestine order known as the fath captures her but doesnt kill her so now with amnesia which is not really explained that well lilith now elle is free to become the aforementioned buffy-clone who has to battle with a mad scientist who got an injection of liliths blood if the previous paragraph sounded hideously convoluted thats because it is the movie is also dull generic and for a film with a plot steeped in theology it doesnt seem to know a lick about it this bargain basement lousy-cgied movie was apparently a failed series pilot all i can say to the fact that it didnt get picked up is a resounding amenmy grade: d-dvd extras: commentary by writerdirector bill platt and co-writer chris regina; and stills gallery; video effects samples: before & after it also has an also available selection that you would think would lead you to some trailers but nope on dvd covers for other films which is a stupid ideadvd-rom extras: final shooting script and deleted scenes transcript both in pdf format<SEP>0
this film has a clear storyline which is quite unusual to the musical genre cats phantom of the opera and other andrew lloyd webbers musicals can be considered metaphorical as they use literary works as their framework biarkan bintang menari bbms storyline touches the very core of human relationships especially that of indonesian people despite the fact the film was based on a supposedly fairytale its actually a fantasy of the child in indonesian adults the dance sequences are not perfect yet the songs represent how indonesians express themselves i reckon the choreographer should explore indonesian way of dancing by not dismaying the fact that indonesias dance development tends to be more westernized the dance sequences seem awkward in some ways and not synchronized with the songs andor music yet i still love this movie and regard it as a new wave of indonesian film genre which i hope to improve in the future<SEP>1
does anyone happen to know where this film was shot the aviation scene on the cliff is beautiful it appears to be england however ivys apartment building certainly looks like the brill building with its fascinating elevatorscharles mendl is listed as playing sir charles gage maybe i blinked but i never saw him perhaps he was the husbands lawyer but again i dont recall that character being in the film other than being mentioned as having made a phone call perhaps he was in the aviation scene or the ballroom scene did anyone spot himherbert marshall was 57 years old when he shot this film<SEP>1

i have watched 3 episodes of caveman and i have no idea why i continue except maybe waiting for it to get better to me this show is just pumping itself off the commercials with no real humor as we sat around watching these shows we all speculated on what was going to happenthe episode of the woman cave-woman with a attitude was actually a big yea right for us shes crude in a theater and acts tough to strangers and truth be told she needed a slapi consider myself a pretty good reviewer taking in everything but i must say cavemen is comparable to the old show my mother the car i give it a 2 only because they deserve 1 better than a 1 because they actually spent money on it<SEP>0

i usually dont walk out of a movie but halfway thru i did this movie promised something different but i kept thinking havent i seen that before spoiler alert! back in 1 the spaceship crashes and lands on earth well all these years later with a super adult on board no less this thing still manages to burn up and crash! what this advanced civilization cant seem to develop landing gear for an industry thats so liberal we get to see another woody allen movie no blacks please! superman runs around saving people making sure he sticks to europe and the us dont go into darkie areas please maybe i could stomach this about 30 years ago but now now<SEP>0
i sat through both parts of che last night back to back with a brief bathroom break and i cant recall when 4 hours last passed so quickly id had to psyche myself up for a week in advance because i have a real thing about directors producers and editors who keep putting over blown over long quasi epics in front of us and i feel that on the whole 2 to 25 hours is about right for a movie so 4 hours seemed to be stretching the limits of my tolerance and i was very dubious about the whole enterprise but i will say upfront that this is a beautifully  i might say lovingly  made movie and im really glad i saw it director steven soderbergh is to be congratulated on the clarity of his vision the battle scenes zing as if you were dodging the bullets yourselfif there is a person on the planet who doesnt know ernesto che guevara was the argentinian doctor who helped fidel castro overthrow fulgencio batista via the 1959 cuban revolution when i was a kid in the 1960s ches image was everywhere; on bedroom wall posters on t shirts on magazine covers ches image has to be one of the most over exploited ever if the famous images are to be relied on then che was a very good looking guy the epitome of revolutionary romanticism had he been butt ugly i have to wonder if he would have ever been quite so popular in the public imagination of course dying young helpsmovies have been made about che before notably the excellent motorcycle diaries of 2004 which starred the unbearably cute gael garcia bernal as young che touring south america and seeing the endemic poverty which formed his marxist politics but i dont think anyone has ever tackled the entire story from beginning to end and this two-parter is an ambitious project i hope it pays off for soderbergh but i can only imagine that instant commercial success may not have been uppermost in his mindthe first movie the agentine shows che meeting castro in mexico and follows their journey to cuba to start the revolution and then the journey to new york in 1964 to address the un cleverly shot black and white images look like contemporary film but arent the second film guerilla picks up again in 1966 when che arrives in bolivia to start a new revolutionary movement the second movie takes place almost entirely in the forest as far as i can see it was shot mostly in spain but i can still believe it must have been quite grueling to film benicio del toro is excellent as che a part he seems born to playpersonally i felt that the argentine ie part one was much easier to watch and more entertaining in the strictly movie sense because it is upbeat they are winning; the revolution will succeed che is in his element leading a disparate band of peasants workers and intellectuals in the revolutionary cause the second part is much harder to watch because of the inevitability of his defeat in much the same way that the recent valkyrie - while being a good movie - was an exercise in witnessing heroic failure so i felt the same about part two of che guerilla we know at the outset that he dies we know he fails it is frustrating because the way the story is told it is obvious fairly early on that the fomentation of revolution in bolivia is doomed; che is regarded as a foreign intruder and fails to connect with the indigenous peoples in the way that he did with the cubans he doggedly persists which is frustrating to watch because i felt that he should have known when to give up and move on to other perhaps more successful enterprises the movie does not romanticise him too much he kills people he executes he struggles with his asthma and follows a lost cause long after he should have given up and moved on he leaves a wife alone to bring up five fatherless childrenbut overall an excellent exercise in classic movie making one note; as i watched the us trained bolivian soldiers move in en masse to pick off che and his small band of warriors one by one it reminded me of the finale to butch cassidy i almost turned to my husband and said so but hesitated thinking he would find such thoughts trite and out of place as we left the theatre he turned to me and said didnt you think the end was like butch cassidy !<SEP>1
im probably not giving this movie a fair shake as i was unable to watch all of it perhaps if id seen it in a theater in its original presentation i might have appreciated it but its far too slow-moving for mei read the book some 25 years ago and the details of the plot have faded from memory this did not help the film as its something less than vivid and clear in its presentation of eventsthis is really four linked films or a film in four parts and was i believe intended to be seen over four nights in a theatrical presentation i found part i to be enjoyable enough but it was all i could do to sit through part ii which drags interminably reading tolstoys philosophizing is one thing if you get a good translation or can read it in the original his brilliant writing far outweighs any issues one might have with the pace of the story on film however its hard to reproduce without being ponderousi have other issues with the parts of the film that i saw its very splashy with a lot of hey-ma-look-at-this camera work that calls attention to itself instead of serving to advance the storyclearly im missing something but i just couldnt summon the enthusiasm to crank up parts iii and iv<SEP>0
the world is a terrible place but this movie is farce and its fun and if you dont like it you dont get it and if you dont get it doesnt matter its up to you if you want to play along every actor in this one had fun its only a joke and thats good enough for me gabriel byrne is priceless byrne and paul anka doing my way is as vic puts it the best version ever okay its no masterpiece but its not bad i was warned against seeing it but im sure glad i did<SEP>1
this is some of the worst acting i have ever seen i love almereydas nadja but this is just absolute dreck aside from a few moments of interesting cinematography and music this film is just nonstop bad acting and dumb material jared harris is particularly bad but no one in this is remotely good the plot is a joke but not the haha kind i dont even know if you can forgive movies that are this bad please erase the last hour and a half of my life how did this director make nadja and another girl another planet<SEP>0
having heard of modesty blaise before but never having read a novel or a comic strip my wife and i liked the film a lot it delivered in a captivating way a good introduction to the character and her backgroundalthough it has some action flick elements it is much more an intimate play excellently written sadly this is also where a major drawback of the movie is revealed an intimate play lives on the capabilities of its actors and unfortunately only half of the cast delivered while alexandra staden did an excellent job as modesty blaise her counterpart nikolaj coaster-waldau - as the villain miklos - did not smiling his way through the plot as if it is an extend toothpaste commercial he fails to build up an atmosphere of anxiety that would have made the movie a masterpiece the supporting cast is somehow similar from some stereotyped gangsters and sluts to decent performances from fred pearson as professor lob and eugenia yuan as irina<SEP>1
i saw this film at its new yorks high falls film festival screening as well and i must say that i found it a complete and awful bore although it was funny in some places the only real laughs was that there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden especially the lovely lady and the voice of the narrator whom i have never heard of had a lot to be desired jcmac was i felt the redeeming feature of this film true action and grit and out of the cast the only real acting i am sure with another cast and a tighter reign on the directing this could have been a half decent film let us just hope that it is not sent out on general release or if you really want a copy look in the bargain bin in lidl<SEP>0
when i saw that this movie was being shown on tv i was really looking forward to it i grew up in the 1980s and like everyone else who has grown up in that era have seen every 80s teen and summer camp movie out there so i couldnt wait to see this movie that totally spoofs that film genre what a disappointment!! the movie was nothing but a bunch of really bad jokes and gags over and over with hardly any plot and no substance and the filmmakers attempts at dark humor totally failed-some of these so-called jokes didnt come across as anything but downright cruel and offensive the only good things about this film were the wardrobe music and acting it was nice to go on a nostalgia trip and see all of the summer clothing styles from the 80s and the same goes for the music and the acting was top-notch throughout: almost all of hollywoods best comedians were present too bad they didnt have better material to work with<SEP>0
i stopped watching this pos as soon as the snakes started taking over the planeat first i thought maybe it should get a one for the comic relief but then i realized i could just watch the three stooges for free and laugh more! whatever respect i might have had for samuel jackson has been irreversibly destroyed and hollywood demonstrates once again how removed from reality they really are when i was a kid we used to catch snakes for fun the only thing snakes would do is huddle at the bottom of the cargo bay and no amount of hollywood cartoon snakes can change thatthis movie isnt worth a trip to blockbuster be warned: if you pay for it the only victim is your dumb assif you want to be really scared i suggest the descent if you want humor go to your local stand up comedy club their worst performer will be a million times better than this trash<SEP>0
the first time i saw this episode was like a shock to me it was actually the first time i saw 24 the speed things are happening is amazing and its so surprising thrilling and even interesting its almost as if you are reading a book; once you start it its very hard to stop from the minute richard walsh was talking privately to jack about the possibility that they have a mole inside ctu i was sitting 6:40 hours which means 10 episodes!!! sounds funny and crazy but im the kind of guy which when he is interested he just cant stopthis series is one of the best of its kind and its build in a way of having a few different stories that are being connected together recommended in every way!<SEP>1
this first-rate western tale of the gold rush brings great excitement romance and james stewart to the screen the far country is the only one out of all five stewart-mann westerns that is often overlooked stewart yet again puts a new look on the ever-present personalities he had in the five stewart-mann westerns jeff webster stewart is uncaring always looking out for himself which is why he is so surprised when people are nice and kindly to him ironically he does wear a bell on his saddle that he will not ride without this displays that he might just care for one person- his sidekick ben tatum played by walter brennan since tatum is the one that gave it to him mann yet again puts a new look on the ever present personalities he put into the five stewart-mann westerns he displays violence excitement plot twists romance and corruption the story is that jeff and ben through a series of events wind up in the get rich quick town of dawson along with gold partners calvet and flippen and no-good but beautiful roman and her hired men they are unable to leave because crooked sheriff mr gannon mcintire and his deputies will hang them since the only way out is through skagway which is gannons town but eventually mcintire comes to them but not to collect stewart andor his fine that he supposedly owes to the government what is mcintire there for he is there to cheat miners out of their claims and money people are killed a sheriff for dawson is considered needed and calvet elects stewart because he is good with a gun stewart however refuses the job because he plans to get all the gold he can and then pull out he also refuses it because he does not like to help people since law and order always gets somebody killed so flippen is elected instead a miner is killed because he tries to stand up to one of gannons men a purely evil mustachioed fancy gunman named madden who carries two guns played by wilke flippen attempts to arrest madden and see that justice be done but he cannot stand up to him so he becomes the town drunk a man named yukon replaces flippen stewart and tatum start to pull out but are ambushed by gannons men tatum is killed and stewart is wounded stewart finally realizes that he must do something or gannon will take over dawson set up his own rules and it will become his town just like skagway the audience also realizes what stewart must do another thing that the audience realizes is that stewart is the only thing that stands between the townspeople and gannon if stewart leaves gannon would take over the town if stewart stays and keeps on not doing anything about it the townspeople will be killed one by one mercilessly and uselessly this is where a great scene occurs stewart walks into his cabin he has a sling on his arm for a few seconds his gun in the gunbelt is hanging on a post beside his bed the gun is close up stewart is in the background just inside the door he stares at it for a few seconds he tosses the sling away the sling lands on the back of a chair and falls to the floor this is symbolic because he is throwing away his old life which consisted of not caring about anybody but himself he comes into his new life of helping people when they need help what ends the film is a guns-blazing furious show of good against evil and a genuinely feel-good feeling that everything will be alright<SEP>1

the gospel of lou was a major disappointment for me i had received an e-mail from the theater showing it that it was a great and inspirational movie it was neither great nor inspirational the cinematography was pretty iffy with the whole movie a lot the scenes were flash backs that were done in a way that couldnt tell at times what they were about the voices were often distorted for no reason also many of the people in the movie were far fetched the relationship he has with his ex & son is never made clear also the whole movie has most him one way and then all of a sudden bam he is cured and inspiring people the whole movie seems to show that boxing is one of the things that is bad in his life making him live his life the way that he is living it but when he changes he doesnt leave boxing he teaches others how to box thumbs down<SEP>0
the first thing i thought after watching mystery men was how could this movie be so unpopular i found this movie so adorable and funny that its status as a bomb defies logic well i hope that in the future it becomes a cult hit and you can count me amoung its fanssimply put and without giving too much away this movie does for comic books what the princess bride did for fairy tales and who framed roger rabbit did for classic cartoons that should give you a more accurate idea of the tone of the movie then the marketing commitee it was unfortunately signed to this is one of those cases like the iron giant where the studio had no clue what it had on its hands rent it the next time youre in the mood for something a little offbeat you wont listen to the beegees in the same light ever again<SEP>1
i found this to be a so-so romancedrama that has a nice ending and a generally nice feel to it its not a hallmark hall of fame-type family film with sleeping-before-marriage considered normal behavior but considering it stars jane fonda and robert de niro i would have expected a lot rougher movie at least language-wise the most memorable part of the film is the portrayal of how difficult it must be to learn how to read and write when you are already an adult thats the big theme of the movie and it involves some touching scenes but to be honest the film isnt that memorableits still a fairly mild nice tale that i would be happy to recommend<SEP>1
how this film gains a 67 rating is beyond belief it deserves nothing better than a 20 and clearly should rank among imdbs worst 100 films of all time national treasure is an affront to the national intelligence and just yet another assault made on american audiences by hollywood critics told of plot holes you could drive a 16 wheeler throughi love the justifications for this movie being good nicholas cage is cute come on people no wonder people around the world think americans are stupid this has to be the most stupid insulting movie i have ever seen if you wanted to see an actually decent film this season consider kinsey the woodsman million dollar baby or sideways national treasure unfortunately got a lot more publicity than those terrific films i bet most of you reading this havent even heard of them since some havent been widely released yetnicholas cage is a terrific actor - when he is in the right movies time after time ive seen cage waste his terrific talent in awful mind-numbing films like con air the rock and face-off when his talent is put to good use like in charlie kaufmans adaptation he is an incredible actorbottom line - id rather feed my hand to a wood chipper than be subjected to this visual atrocity again<SEP>0
second part actually episode 4-8 of the hit danish tv-series is slightly inferior to the first one but has plenty of laughs and scares as well this time udo kier plays two parts as the monster baby and his demon-like father other standout parts this time are søren pilmark´s doctor krogshoj who must face the horrible revenge of dr helmer and once again patient mrs drusse tries to solve the mysteries miss marple-style ends on a cliffhanger and following the deaths of lead actors ernst hugo järegård dr helmer and kirsten rolffes mrs drusse you wonder how they´re ever going to be able making part iii but i hope von trier will give it a shot sadly morten rotne leffers the down´s syndrome dishwasher #2 died shortly after as well look for stellan skarsgård in a cameo ***<SEP>1
this is a true 80s movie: back then they made maybe 100 times more movies than nowadays and that makes many of them quite interesting it was a cultural phenomenon that dont exist anymore nowadays maybe the same kind of people that would have made cheap straight-to-video-movies in the eighties are doing cheap porn porn seems to sell anyway this is above the medium trash-movie level: it has good&fascinating story and its quite well made i think in one scene you can even see the microphone swinging on the upper edge of the picture of course there are also little cameos by ozzy and gene simmons but they dont very much contribute to the film success although they are good in their small roles the monsterheavy-singer sammi curr looks really terrible especially when hes singing one of the scariest monsters ive seen in horror flicks i may have nightmares of him next night not recommended for intellectual movie lovers<SEP>1
everyone in a while disney makes one of thoes movies that surprises everyone one that keeps you wondering until the very end in the tradition of pirates of the caribbean this movie is sure to turn into a ghost and kill and rape your village its terrible if you want a mindless senseless predictable action movie go right ahead i believe that young kids might enjoy this as they like it when good always wins but me i like movies where its a toss up whos going to win this movie never lets the bad guys have the upper hand by the end when th heroes are left in an inescapeable pit you just know that they can get out everything works out perfect for cage and his friends he never has to think over a riddle or clue for more than 10 seconds no matter how complex it is see this movie if you want to see some impressive set designs not if you want to see good acting or a good film go watch a superman movie it would be much shorter and the kids would like it more for instance the scene where cage is fleeing from armed gunmen and the bullets are all deflected by a the railing of a fire escape and im not talking about a fence or anything just one little pole this movie shows the decay of films and the film industry to cheap gags and dull unrealistic action which this movie provides in huge quantities<SEP>0
we can start with the wooden acting but this film is a disaster having grown up in ny i can tell you that this film is an insult to anyone who is familiar with the community or the people im not even a defender of the culture in any way and found this to be a hollywoodized piece of trash to fit its own fictional ridiculous culture presentation and language that anyone who watches seinfeld knows is inaccurate this is a colossal waste of time and even worse is not exactly interesting since the outcome is obvious and the scenes of confrontation are laughably bad who acts this way nobodythe writers name sounds israeli or something of that nature but it is clear he doesnt have a clue about the subject he is writing about looking at his bio it is shocking he lived in new york and wonder how much real connection he had with the community even mediocre films like a stranger among us are better and more closer to the truth than this dreck reading this guys credits its no wonder he has written scripts on all c grade films that somehow feature stars shocking perhaps he knows someone because this script is even below par for a bad dolph lundgren film<SEP>0
frankly i dont understand why this movie has been such a big flop in publicity sharon stone certainly has not lost any of her charisma and touch since basic instinct i voted this film 10 and i tell you why: game opens in london this time london is the city where catherine tramell has moved since the events in bi1 again she proves to be a mastermind manipulator of her own class -unchallenged she is screwing your brain as catherine with such a skill that in the end you dont be quite sure who is the real villainas for the technical part of the film: only real setback is the b-rate crew of actors sharon stone is the only really big name in the cast compared to her and michael douglas etc in the first part i also think bi2 would have been better had sharon stone been a bit younger but she is still quite stunning in her looks and has only improved concerning her charisma her b-rate assistants are not so bad either although i would have wanted some bigger names to the casti think there are quite good improvements in the basic plot i think this is a far better thriller than many of the run-off-the-mill crap hollywood so readily distributes these days the plot is great its easy to see technically you dont snore in the half way through the film and most important -the heath is on<SEP>1
i like chris rock but i feel he is wasted in this film the idea of remaking heaven can wait is fine but the filmmakers followed the plot of that turkey too closely when eddie murphy remade dr doolittle and the nutty professor he re-did them totally -- so they became murphy filmsvehicles not just tepid remakes thats why they were successful if chris had done the same this could have been a much better film the few laughs that come are when he is doing his standup routine -- so he might as well have done a concert film it also would have been much funnier if the white man whose body he inhabits was a truck driver or hillbilly so why does hollywood keep making junk like this because people go to see it -- because they like chris rock so give chris a decent script and give us better movies! dont remake films that werent that good in the first place!<SEP>0
this film was choppy incoherent and contrived it was also an extremely mean-spirited portrayal of women i rented it because it was listed as a comedy thats a stretch and because the cover said andie mcdowell was acting up a storm in it she wasnt im a gal i watched this film with two guys and we spent an hour afterwards exclaiming over how bad it waswarning: plot summary below! rampant spoilers!the movie starts out with a fairly hackneyed plot about an older woman who takes up with a younger man to the severe disapproval of her two jealous single girlfriends they want her to marry a boring guy their own age who is kind of in love with her but shes so happy with her oversexed puppy that youre rooting for them to stick it out and sure enough she decides to marry the guy but her harpy girlfriend aided by the wishy-washy one sets up a plot to trick our heroine into thinking the guy is cheating on her it works she has a fight with him he runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck remember the movies title so now hes dead two-thirds of the way through the film and although our heroine is a school headmistress who spends her time watching over girls she apparently forgot to use birth control and is pregnantshes already broken off relations with her girlfriends because they were so unsupportive alone and pitiful she decides to marry the boring guy did i mention that the boring guy who kind of loves her is a minister she had asked him to marry her to the young guy nice huh but now she tells him shell marry him and apparently he has no objections to being dicked around in this fashion but her girlfriends rescue her at the altar and take her home where they not-quite-confess that they were mostly responsible for the love of her life getting smushed she has the kid in the final scene they leave it in a crib inside her house while they go out on the porch to drink smoke and be smug i kid you not its that bad i left out the part about the cancer red-herring and the harpys ridiculous lesbian moment<SEP>0
holes originally a novel by louis sachar was successfully transformed into an entertaining and well-made film starring sigourney weaver as the warden shia labeouf as stanley and khleo thomas as zero the roles were very well casted and the actors portrayed their roles wellthe film had inter-weaving storylines that all led up to the end the main storyline is about stanley yelnats and his punishment of spending a year and a half at camp greenlake the second storyline is about sam and kate barlow this plot deals with racism and it is the more deep storyline to the movie the third is about elya yelnats and madame zeroni which explains the 100-year curse on the yelnats family in my opinion these storylines were weaved together very wellcontrary to many peoples beliefs i think that you do not have to have read the book to understand the movie the film is reasonably easy to understandthe acting in the film was well done especially shia labeouf stanley khleo thomas zero sigourney weaver the warden and jon voight mr sir the other members of d-tent jake smith squid max kasch zig-zag miguel castro magnet byron cotton armpit and brenden jefferson x-ray enhanced the comic relief of the movie however the best parts were with zero and stanley who made a great team togetheralthough holes is a disney movie it deals with some serious issues such as racism shootings and violence the films dramatization at some points is very well donei would suggest this movie to people of all ages whether they have read the book or not you shouldnt miss it<SEP>1
who in their right mind plays a lyrical song at the same time they are portraying an emotional scene between two people when flipper confronts his wronged wife in the dressing room the song sung with lyrical content is as loud as the dialog so one can hear neither diluting any emotional impact the scene may have had the scenes of annabella getting beaten by her father with his fists a lamp and then a belt was so cartoonish as to be absurd this entire movie is a cartoon the rampant prejudice against whites is literally astounding the discussion by the black women after flippers wife finds out he has cheated on her with a white woman - as if it were a discussion by an oxford debating team is ridiculous the rampant racism might be possible to endure but the soundtrack and the sound mixing during this movie is too much it was a technically poorly made movie there is no understanding of the basic craft of movie making the sound track the editing and the desperate attempt of great actors trying to keep this movie afloat i actually felt sorry for anthony quinn wondering why he had accepted a role in this flick - his appearance in this is painful this is the first movie i have seen by this director and it will be my last<SEP>0
i just rented this movie to see dolph lundgren whom i hadnt seen in any movies since rocky iv unfortunately this movie was a big disappointment the acting of all the parties was bad except for mr lundgren who was okay-ish kata dobó was something nice to look at despite her ridiculous outfit and make-upthe plot is not at all clever its something thats been repeated a million times in different movies the crooks were utterly stereotypical and lundgrens character hadnt any depth in it i didnt really expect a movie masterpiece but unfortunately this is not even decent action every turn in the plot is extremely predictable and the unbelievable amount of over-the-top unrealism and comic-book like characters started to annoy me strongly pretty sooni would recommend this to young kids wanting some comic-like action but only if nothing else is available110 i guess the current average vote of 70 with 6 votes must have been influenced by somebody involved in making this movie<SEP>0
i love korean films because they have the ability to really quiet eerily really capture real life i tend to watch korean movies just for that reason alone ive seen this directors other movies before the one that comes closest to the feelings i got from this is oasis and another awesome film called this charming girlhowever my title summary is supposed to be from a chrstian perspective so ill just start doing that instead of just showering it with praisefor a non christian perspective director chang-dong lee has captured an unbiased and almost eerily real portrayal of a modern protestant church regardless of denomination warts and all ive always been waiting for a christian film that truly portrays the darker recesses of church life because christian films tend to speak in a language that is different to those they want to share their faith to many films with religious undertones though having good motives tend to just have the resonance of a disney film or after school special they need to show life as it is real people curse real people lust real people fall and though christians believe that salvation is available to those that seek it we are still challenged by the everyday horrors of this life and do-yeon jeons character is a totally honest and almost brutal portrayal of a woman that found god but because of lifes bitter realities loses that love for him she once had she doesnt deny god exists it is just that she refuses to accept to live with the idea that he is an all loving and forgiving godin her decent to the edges of morality and madness her character asks questions that are in the mind of every one religious or notif god is love why does he allow such terrible things to happen this film doesnt answer that rightly so and i believe the last 10 minutes of the film though open to interpretation leaves us with a hopeful future for our main character and brings the idea of secret sunshine full circlei dont believe for a second that this film tried to be religious or had in any way tried and set out to be that there in lies the reason why it worked even more its real its honest and because of that it is by far the best summation of a real christian life i have seen on film<SEP>1
i got this movie from netflix after a long waiting time so i was anticipating it greatly when it arrived my worst fears were that it would be plodding as well as well you know what all the screaming fan girls were babbling about gacktnhyde=hawt yaoi love that sort of thing dreading it i was very very pleasantly surprised the movie was surprisingly watchable even if the filming and music did make it feel like someone was going to bust out a pair of nun-chucks every two scenes and the acting on gackts part was quite good hyde being um hyde acted as a quasi-romantic friendgang member character that anyone who saw him on stage would hardly be surprised by hes one of my two major beefs with the film itself but the rest of the cast including the child actors in the opening scene were very good at doing what they did- which was mostly get shot at and yelled at but my second problem was very minor having to do with the goriness it seemed way too suspense-horror to me- like every scene where someone is shot they either slump over really most sincerely dead or lay there burbling for a rather long time but sho just takes the shots repeatedly keels over bubbles a lot while he talks and makes hyde cry all in all if youre a fan of any of the actors or just a j-film fan its definitely worth a watch<SEP>1
they had an opportunity to make one of the best romantic tragedy mafia movies ever because they had the actorsthe budgetand the story but the great director john huston was too preoccupied trying to mellow out this missed classicstrenuously trying to find black humor as often as possible which diluted the movie very muchand also they were so uncaring with details like sound and detailed actionmaybe it was the age of the director who passed away two years later<SEP>0
this is paul f ryans first and only full-length feature he hasnt done anything since however he managed to get an amazing ensemble cast to portray the characters of his story i dont know when or why the idea emerged in his head but ryan wrote a screenplay which later became his own directed movie home roombusy philipps carries the movie on her shoulders as alicia a troubled girl; the ones we always see in television series with dark hair and black clothes; a package of cigarettes in the pocket weird look and disturbing eyes with makeup of course an event has occurred at her school; a shooting some students have died and she saw everything now detective martin van zandt victor garber is investigating the case and as expected alicia is a suspect but the shooting is just the genesis; the movie is not about the shootinglying in bed in a hospital room is deanna cartwright erika christensen she is one of the survivors of the hospital the script establishes a bond between them by the school principal james pickens jr he is helping all the students to recover from the event but alicia doesnt seem to care shes isolated so the principal punishes her; she needs to visit deanna every day until five o clock then the movie startsi cant even describe how wonderfully written i think the movie is i can identify with the characters and the situations they live; i like reality these things could happen to anyone and the things they say are totally understandable theyre growing up and trying to deal with things they havent experienced; theyre doing their best without knowing it alicia when she visits deanna for the first time and deanna when she sees alicia standing in front of her are commencing a journey of that will define their personalities and ideas for the next step in life; after high schoolthe director leads christensen and philipps through their roles very well look the contrast between them deanna seems naive and with plain thoughts; no complexity inside of her mind when alicia enters her room and sees tons of flowers she asks: who has brought them many people deanna answers; although some days later we learn theyre from her parents who come every week the parental figures are all well represented but are not as important as their sons characters deanna is lonely alicia seems mature and violent; smoking cigarettes and talking roughly but after two days of visiting she finds herself coming back to the hospital every day; even sleeping in deannas room all night when they both have a fight afterwards i believe deanna says: why do you keep coming back alicia is lonely toothe ending of the movie without ruining it comes a bit disappointing; its something i wasnt waiting for it eliminates some of the strength the movie has the revelation comes totally unnecessary; ruining the logical climax the movie could have had it was an excellent script anyway; and an excellent direction a damn fine moviewhen it comes to erika christensen this was the role she needed to fly higher her role in traffic was impressing but this was the big step; the main role maybe not many had the chance to see her in this film and thats a pity she hasnt made one false move since then she has even come out with good performances in awful movies on the other hand busy philipps who proved to be very promising in this movie what a transformation hasnt got many opportunities for other rolesthe same i say about paul f ryan in directing of curse and i expect he is sitting now in his computer finishing his new script; im waiting for his next movie im hoping the best for all of them<SEP>1
when you are in a gloomy or depressed mood go watch this film it shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday setting and it is very encouraging in particular from a feminist and a humanist perspectivewhen you know both the turkish language and either the danish or the german language go watch the film in any case half of the dialog is danish in the original synchronized to german in the translated version the other half turkish subtitled in danish or german respectively when i watched it in mannheim germany the reaction of the turkish-speaking audience proved that there must be a lot of humor in the turkish dialog which deplorably mostly escaped me being only imperfectly rendered in the subtitles still the film is interesting even if you lack knowledge of the turkishesthetically the movie is playing a lot on the theme of speed and slowness on first sight there is lots of corporeal movement fast as lightning making it a quick an agitated film in particular even though this is a kung fu movie watch out for the running scenes beautifully expressing a wealth of emotions but there are quite a few very slow emotionally intense scenes too and above all the characters develop at a much slower pace than you would expect in a drama about the coming of age; still there is some movement in the characters to: closely watch the villain omar whose part and acting i liked very muchthe contrast of speed and stillness nicely contributes to the depiction of human rage and dignity - shown at once in the same characters at the same time<SEP>1
while william shater can always make me smile in anything he appears in and i especially love him as denny crane in boston legal well this show is all about glitz and dancing girls and screaming and jumping up and downit has none of the intelligence of millionaire none of the flair of deal or no dealthis show is all about dancing and stupid things to fill in the timei watched it of course just to check it out i did watch it for over 45 minutes then i had to turn it offthe best part of it was william shatner dancing on the stage he is a hoot!!! unfortunately this show will not make itthats a given<SEP>0
this was a fairly creepy movie; i found the music to be effective for this the photographs mario took of the village were also unnerving however i had three problems with this film one is that the lighting was very dark so some of the time it was hard to tell what was going on but this may have just been my copy the second is that the very beginning is not explained very well and im still not sure what was going on there the third problem is that i didnt understand the ending but apparently some people do of course there are also the usual problems of people doing stupid things and the male lead is very 70s all in all watchable but not even close to being a favorite<SEP>0
i just saw this film @ tiff toronto international film festival fans of hal hartley will not be disappointed!! and if you are not familiar with this directors oeuvre doesnt matter this film can definitely stand all on its own i have to go the second screening it was amazing i need to see it again -- and fast!! this film is very funny its dialogue is very smart and the performance of parker posey is outstanding as she stars in the title role of fay grim fay grim is the latest feature revisiting the world and characters introduced in the film henry fool 2000 visually the most salient stylistic feature employs the habitual use of the canted or dutch angle which can be often seen in past hartley works appearing in various shorts available in the possible films: short works by hal hartley 1994-2004 collection and in the girl from monday 2005i viewed this film most aptly on sept 11th textually fay grims adventure in this story is backdropped against the changed world after september 11 2001 without going into major spoilers i view this work and story-world as a bravely political and original portrait of geo-politics that is rarely if ever foregrounded in mainstream fictional cinema post-911 heretofore cf syrianna: of side note - mark cuban exec prod in both these films most interesting to say the least lastly for those closely attached to the characters of henry fool simone fay and henry this film is hilariously self-conscious and self-referential that being said the character of fay grimm starts off in the film exactly where she was when henry fool ended but by the end of the film fays knowledge and experience has total changed and expanded over the course of the narrative what can be in store for the future of fay and the fool family i cant wait for the third part in this story!<SEP>1
but its worth watching for boyer lorre and paxinou greenes entertainments that were filmed during the war either required transplanting to american shores as in this gun for hire or the use of american actors in roles where they did not fit bacall fits that part here i kept waiting for her to whistle and bring bogie to life; her tone of voice is simply all wrong for an upper class englishwoman but listen to the dialogue! no people dont talk that way except in books but greene was sending a message about an england that needed to wake up to the dangers of the world one other positive note: greenes range of characters were kept whole while mr mukerjee resembled more a brahamin at least his nationality was kept and his final conversation with paxinou is priceless<SEP>1
this is the true story of how three british soldiers escaped from the german prisoner of war pow camp stalag luft iii during the second world war this is the same pow camp that was the scene for the great escape which resulted in the murder of 50 re-captured officers by the gestapo and later was made into a very successful movie of the same name while the other pows in stalag luft iii are busy working on their three massive tunnels known as tom dick & harry two enterprising british prisoners came up with the idea to build a wooden vaulting horse which could be placed near the compound wire fence shortening the distance they would have to tunnel from this starting point to freedom the idea to build their version of the trojan horse came to them while they were discussing classic attempts for escape and observing some pows playing leap-frog in the compoundinitially containing one and later with two pows hidden inside the wooden horse could be carried out into the compound and placed in almost the same position near the fence on a daily basis while volunteer pows vaulted over the horse the escapees were busy inside the horse digging a tunnel from under the vaulting horse while positioned near the wire under the wire and into the woods the story also details the dangers that two of the three escaping pows faced while traveling through germany and occupied europe after they emerged from the tunnel all three pows who tried to escape actually hit home runs escaped successfully to their home base the wooden horse gives a very accurate and true feeling of the tension and events of a pow breakout the movie was shot on the actual locations along the route the two pows traveled in their escape made with far less a budget than the great escape the wooden horse is more realistic if not more exciting than the great escape and never fails to keep you from the edge of your seat rooting for the pows to make good their escape the story line is crisp and the acting rings true and is taut enough to keep the tension up all the way through the movie the wooden horse is based on the book of the same name by one of the escapees eric williams and is by far the best pow escape story ever made into a movie some of the actual pows were used in the movie to reprise their existence as prisoners in stalag luft iii i give this movie a well deserved ten<SEP>1
my dog recently passed away and this was a movie i loved as a kid so i had to see it to try to cheer upbeware of dog i mean spoilers this movie isnt just for kids and its far from ordinary it was set in new orleans in 1939 first and foremost the dog was not portrayed as an extra family member in this film but as an adult with his own complicated life to deal within the beginning charlie is not too different from his dishonest and brutal business partner carface he is money driven greedy and just escaped death row as he states in the start of the feature the difference between charlie and carface is that charlie can learn and is willing to listen to others; anne marie and his sidekick itchy carface will not even listen to the fat ugly dog with the big glasses who happens to be closest to himcarface attempts to murder the hero because he wants 100% of the profits in their business and wont settle for only 50% - a highly unusual way for a german shepherd mix to die also being eaten by a prehistoric sized alligator who ends up sparing your life because you can sing is highly unlikely whether you are a dog or not this is a cartoon and thats why it is logical herecarfaces method of revenge is through murder while charlie believes success is the best revenge financial success that is after surviving death he starts a business by taking carfaces source of financing a highly talented girl who possesses the ability to communicate with animals they win a whole bunch of races and charlie tells her hell give the money to the poor - hint hint: charlie and itchy live in a junkyard and are therefore poor he uses the money toward his casinobartheatre and not the other poor the reason why anne marie has the ability to talk to animals is that she has compassion and she listens carefully she teaches charlie ethics by pointing out his gambling lying and stealing charlie tries to make up for it by buying her dresses she added the ethics that his business needed while charlie did management and itchy provided constructioncarface uses violence and property damage to tear down charlies business which is unprotected by the government charlie loses everything and all he has left is this little girl in the end he had to choose between her life and his own he first grabs the watch out of self preservation and sets it down when the girl started to sink both the girl and the watch were sinking and he had to choose which one and he chose the girlthe great part about this movie that focuses on a persons ability to learn right from wrong over time and a childs ability to cope with the natural occurrence of death of their pet is that it never shows anyone dying! the watch symbolizes his life and the watch is shown being submerged and stopped all the deaths were suggestive even for the villain i didnt cry during this movie until now and i have gotten so much more out of it that i had to write it down and share it with you<SEP>1
this isnt among jimmy stewarts best films--im quick to admit that however while some view his film as pure propaganda im wondering whats so wrong with that yes sure like the tv show the fbi this is an obvious case of the bureau doing some pr work to try to drum up support but as entertainment goes it does a good job plus surprisingly enough for the time it was made the film focuses more on crime than espionage and commies instead its a fictionalization of one of the earliest agents and the career he chose now considering the agent is played by jimmy stewart then its pretty certain the acting and writing were good--as this was a movie with a real budget and a studio who wasnt about to waste the star in a third-rate flick so overall its worth seeing but not especially great<SEP>1
this movie is beautifully designed! there are no flaws not in the design of the set the lighting the sounds the plot the script is an invitation to a complex game where the participants are on a simple missionpaxton is at his best in this role his mannerisms the infections used in the tones of his voice are without miscue each shot meticulously done! surprises turn up one after another when the movie reaches past its first hour this may not be the best picture of the year but its a gem that has been very well polished its not for the simple mind<SEP>1
this quasi j-horror film followed a young woman as she returns to her childhood village on the island of shikoku to sell the family house and meet up with old friends she finds that one the daughter of the village priestess drowned several years earlier she and fumiko another childhood friend then learn that sayoris mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic already the bonds between the dead and living are getting weak and the friends and villagers are seeing ghosts nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie unlike stellar j-horror films the suspense doesnt really build the result doesnt seem overly threatening and the ending borders on the absurdthis movie is like plain white rice cooked a little too long so that it is bordering on mushy sometimes you get this at poor asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a little too long you end up eating it because you need it with the meal because what is chinese or japanese food without rice but it almost ruins the meal because of the gluey gooey tastelessness of it all 310 http:blogmyspacecomlocoformovies<SEP>0
this is quite possibly the worst christmas film ever the plot is virtually non-existent the acting affleck in particular is poor at best ben affleck fans will probably defend this film but deep down they must agree as far as i could gather the plot consisted of ben affleck a millionaire salesman is told by a shrink to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burn a list of things he wanted to forget from his childhood on doing this he ends up paying the family currently living in the house to be his family for christmas and that is it the film goes on and eventually he gets together with the daughter of the family blah blah blah<SEP>0
this move actually had me jumping out of my chair in anticipation of what the actors were going to do! the acting was the best farrah should have gotten a oscar for this she was fabulous james russo was so good i hated him he was the villain and played it wonderful there arent many movies that have riveted me as this one the cast was great alfie looking shocked with those big eyes farrah looking like a victim and you re-lived her horror as she went through it farrah made you feel like you were there and feeling the same anger she felt you wanted her to hurt him yet you also knew it was the wrong thing to do the movie had you on a roller coaster ride and you went up and down with each scene<SEP>1

this movie stinks the stench resembles bad cowpies that sat in the sun too long i cant believe that so many talented actors wasted their time making such a hopelessly awful film whew!<SEP>0
this 1947 film stars and was directed and written by orson welles with a funky irish accent and also stars the gorgeous rita hayworth with less appealing short blonde hair so ive hung out with orson before in touch of evil and citizen kane and the third man etc but this was my first rita hayworth interaction our first meeting went well she does a superb job playing the frightenedcagey elsa married to a crippled millionaire lawyer mike welles and elsa fall for each other he wants to run away with her she doesnt know if she can live without the things money can buy elsa her husband and his partner bicker and bite just like the sharks mike describes attacking each other and his foretelling proves just too true several twists and turns follow in this murder mystery as we come to the climax in the fun house think the ending shootout in the man with the golden gun which borrowed heavily from this scene i wasnt sure who the murderer was until the endthis movie is like shrimp in garlic and lemon the dish centers on the sea it is subtle sour and pungent all to great effect these might not be the best fresh shrimp but good quality frozen shrimp from costco the flavorful sauce adds to the naturalness of the pink shrimp as you fill up on a healthy but filling alternative to more mundane common fare 710 http:blogmyspacecomlocoformovies<SEP>1
refreshing `lost gem! featuring effective dialog combined with excellent acting to establish the characters and involve you enough to care what happens to them the douglas and widmark characters are realistic heroes palance is his usual evil presence widmark win the fisticuffs fight scene a car chase of less than 60 seconds with a `logical end and a lengthy chase on foot that shames the overdone chase sequences of contemporary hollywood you know how it will likely end but the suspense and interest are sustained throughout the end of the chase is one of the most realistic you will ever see the film seems to slow a little past the middle but stay with it for the rewarding conclusion<SEP>1
my very favorite character in films but in nearly all of them the character of zorro has a small bit of cloth as a mask and if the villain`s can`t tell who is under that cloth then they are daftbut in reed hadley`s zorro`s fighting legion serial 1939 the mask fills his whole face making it a real mystery as to who zorro really isbut anyway zorro is one of the best character`s in films and to bring it up to date l think anthony hopkins in the mask of zorro 1998 is a delightmy interest in films is vast but l have a real liking for the serial`s of the 30s40sbond2a<SEP>1
i am a catholic taught in parochial elementary schools by nuns taught by jesuit priests in high school & college i am still a practicing catholic but would not be considered a good catholic in the churchs eyes because i dont believe certain things or act certain ways just because the church tells me toso back to the movieits bad because two people are killed by this nun who is supposed to be a satire as the embodiment of a female religious figurehead there is no comedy in that and the satire is not done well by the over acting of diane keaton i never saw the play but if it was very different from this movies then it may be goodat first i thought the gun might be a fake and the first shooting all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate sister marys emotional and intellectual bigotry of faith but it turns out the bullets were real and the story has tragedythe tragedy of loss of life besides the two former studentsthe lives of the aborted babies the life of the students mom the tragedy of dogmatic authority over love of people the tragedy of organized religion replacing true faith in god this is what is wrong with todays islam and yesterdays judaism and christianity<SEP>0
camp blood iii is a vast improvement on camp blood ii as it has sound mostly in the right places and a rudimentary plot this time theyve ventured slightly further away from the car park the other two movies were filmed in which is a good move as you can no longer hear cars driving past what is supposed to be a remote wildernessthis time around theres a reality tv show and a fake clown to scare off the contestants this is hardly a new idea ive seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same premise where the real killer turns up but at least this one has a plot instead of people just randomly being stabbed with a knifeunlike the other two in the series this one is at least good for a few laughs i liked how theres a gunshot sound effect when someone gets stabbed early on and the way the boom mike hovers behind people like a phantomi dont know why anyone would want to make a third camp blood film i would have thought it would be better to start from scratch but they have at least tried with this one the half naked deformed woman was a bit much for me it looks like they tried to keep continuity by hiring some freak who would get her clothes off for $5 just like they did in the second movie they still havent worked out that a machete is used for cutting not stabbing but oh well its a camp blood movie what do you expect if you like crap films youll get some fun out of this one<SEP>0
nowhere near the original its quite accurate copy bringing nothing new to the story but the directing is very poor basinger is weak - without good directing baldwin is simply just a second league compared to mcqueen i watched it just out of curiosity being a huge fan of peckinpahs masterpiece and i got what i thought almost a b movie with second rate acting and directing i wasnt even disappointed i just dont know what they were trying to do this remake doesnt try to play with the original material its not a tribute and indeed it lacks some really good actor of its erait reminds me of a bad xerox copy of wonderful photographthis is a complete waste of your time save yourself 2 hours or watch the original again:<SEP>0
the opening sequence alone is worth the cost of admission as cheech and chong drag that big ol garbage can across the parking lot filled with gas dont spill it man ! hilarious stuff and then as the plot ensues youre in for one heck of a ride i watched this film recently and it holds up being just as funny upon each viewing check it out<SEP>1
i have loved this movie since i first saw it in 1979 im still amazed at how accurately kurt russell portrays elvis right down to how he moves and the expressions on his face sometimes its scary how much he looks acts and talks like the real elvis thankfully this is being released on dvd so all of us that have been waiting can finally have an excellent quality version of the full length film i have heard the detractors who say that there are some inaccuracies or some things left out but i think that keeping in mind that john carpenter only had about 2 12 hours to work with and that this was being shown on television just two years after elviss death! that he did a fine job with this in fact i havent seen another elvis movie that even comes close to this one highly recommended<SEP>1
aside from a few titles and the new sherlock holmes movie i think ive watched every movie guy ritchie has directed twice needless to say im a big fan and revolver is one of the highlighted reasons why this movie is a very different approach from ritchie when you look at it comparatively with lock stock and snatch revolver sets us up for a psychological thriller of sorts as a gambling con finds himself at the mercy of a set of foes he didnt expect and a guided walk for redemption that he didnt know he needed along with seeing andré benjamin of outkast fame strut his acting ability other standout acts are ray liotta playing the maniacal mr dmacha and mark strong playing sorter the hit-manafter being sent to prison by a tyrannous casino owner macha jake uses his time in solitary to finesse a plot to humiliate macha and force his hand in compensating him for the seven years he spent when he wins a card game and amasses a decent sum from macha jake finds himself on the brink of death as he collapses and is diagnosed with an incurable disease thats left him with three days to live a team of loan sharks however have an answer for him and a ticket to life- only if he gives them all the money he has and relents to working for them all in a ploy to both take macha down and show jake how dangerous he has made himself to himself along with having the air of death loom and a pair of loan sharks having a field day with his money jake also has to deal with having a hit put out on him which introduces sorter - a hit-man under machas employ the depth with the story comes when jake realizes that some co- convicts he spent time with in solitary may very-well be the loan shark team out to take him for all he has by crafting all of the unfortunate events that jake seems to find his way into when faced with this reality though zack vincent pastore and avi show jake just how twisted he has become from being in solitary having only the company of his mind and his ego then makes it so that their actual existence is elusive even to jake the movie unravels to a humbling process for both jake and macha as they both come to grips with their inner demonsthe style of the movie is top-notch as you get the gritty feel of the crime world represented and the characters it includes although a lot of nods at ritchies previous films are here it still has a presence of its own from the dialogue the sets and the experimental take on the gangster genre its also a great trip on humility and recognizing when you can easily let your ego or a preset notion mask you ability to accomplish what you want or overcome what you should the characters are well crafted in this movie with all sides being fleshed out and true to ritchie fashion theyre all tied in by some underhandedness that throws a wrench in everyones affairs i could and would like to go on about this film and its unique nuances but i dont want to take too much away from it if you havent seen it yetit may take a few sittings to get through all the intricate layers but its a great movie and it should be seen if youre lucky and you havent seen the watered-down us release see if you can get the original uk version as it will make for a great discussion piece among friends as you try to puzzle in your take i saw it with my crew around early-2006 and were still talking about it with little things weve picked up on today it has garnered its cult status and its well- deserved as the film where ritchie stepped out the box and broke his norm a bitstandout line: fear or revere me but please think im special we share an addiction were approval junkies<SEP>1
even though the book wasnt strictly accurate to the real situation it described it still carried a sense of japan i find it hard to believe that anyone who was involved in making this film had ever been to japan as it didnt feel japanese in the slightest almost everything about it was terrible i will admit the actors were generally quite good but couldnt stand a chance of saving it before the film started i was surprised that there were only ten people in the cinema on a friday night shortly after the movie had opened in japan 30 minutes in i was amazed they stayed i stayed so i would have the right to criticize it the whole movie was punctuated my groans and suppressed laughs of disbelief from my japanese girlfriend everyone i saw walking out of that cinema had looks of confusion and disappointment on their faces to the makers of this movie you owe me two hours<SEP>0
at what point exactly does a good movie go bad when does a movie go from watchable to wheres that &^@_+#!* off switch thank goodness for dvds like this one that can be borrowed from the library - for free! likewise thank goodness for the fast forward switch on the dvd player i feel sorry for those people who were duped at the box officeat one point ive forgotten exactly when because now its all just a blur our hero luke wilson starts running through traffic; i think he was looking for a cab it was at that point when i gave up realizing i couldnt care whether he found his ride or got run over by a garbage truckthe last time the movie was interesting was when luke wilson climbs out of the dumpster hair dryer in hand and first meets the heroine uma thurman that scene ended with the purse-snatching criminal dangling helplessly from the fire escape far far above the departing luke and uma that was the last time the movie was funny and when was that scene ten minutes into the flickevery time the movie tried to become funny it couldnt every time the movie approached excitement it fizzled out heading in the opposite direction when a musical score might have helped squeeze life out of this dullard the sound track stayed empty and silentthe sex scenes were not needed and were beyond lame; the damage to sets and props unnecessary and childish when uma turns into the crazy ex-girlfriend i felt like i was watching the 40 year old virgin meets pulp fiction; thats when i realized that there was no turning back because i thoroughly disliked the 40 year old virgin and pulp fictionluke wilsons sidekick rainn wilson also seen in the dreary the last mimzy adds nothing but insult to injury in this awful movie rainn wilson the king of television boredom should stay with that equally awful medium hey rainn wilson! leave full-length motion pictures alone! every time umas rival anna faris came on screen i expected jason or freddy or some fright flick monster to jump out from behind the scenery; once you see anna faris in scary movie thats all you ever see no matter the movie no matter the medium the character played by wanda sykes was just plain awful and was so out of place in this flick<SEP>0
first of all id like to say that i love the ladies man sketch on snl i always laugh out loud at tim meadows portrayal of leon phelps however there is a difference between an 8-minute sketch and a feature-length movie watching leon doing his show and making obscene comments to his listeners and coming up with all sorts of segments for his show like the ladies man presents which is reminiscent of alfred hitchcock presents is absolutely hilarious theres a great episode where cameron diaz role-plays monica lewinski and leon plays bill and they call it the oral office see thats funny!!! in the movie we dont see leon on the show too often in fact he gets kicked out of almost every radio station in the country and the plot revolves around his quest for true love involving a mystery letter that got dropped off at his houseboat signed by sweet thing karyn parsons who is famous for playing hillary on fresh prince of bel air works with him on the show and has a secret crush on leon the movie just piles on one boring subplot after another and the gags are boring as well the first time we see leon mention the word wang its pretty funny when he uses it over and over again supposedly trying to get a laugh the joke has run dry most of the jokes he uses in the film are jokes we heard before and done better on the snl sketch and played out tediously for a whole hour and twenty-five minutes they even try to insert a musical number by will ferrell and his gang of ladies man haters who all want to destroy him because their wives had an affair with him to bring some life into this witless comedy ferrell has some funny moments and tries to make the best out of an otherwise unfunny role ferrell just has that unique comic talent and hes funny at almost anything he does even julianne moore gets a cameo watching her you cant but wonder what the hell is an oscar-winning actress doing in this movie!!!! her name wasnt mentioned in the opening credits--probably by her consent and of course a movie of this theme has to include the master of love himself billy dee williams billy dee is charismatic as always but even he cant breathe enough life into this film i also have to add that the soundtrack is full of soft r & b hits which impairs the film even more giving it a horribly downbeat tone--as if the script isnt boring enough i mean this is supposed to be a comedy the soundtrack wouldve been appropriate for something like love jones the ladies man only has sporadic laughs there are exceptions in which snl can produce a great movie out of a short sketch watch both of the waynes world movies and youll see how its done but this movie just like adapting mary catherine gallaghers character to screen in superstar shows the flip side some sketches are meant to be remembered on snl and not on the silver screenmy score: 3 out of 10<SEP>0
i rate this 10 out of 10 why* it offers insight into something i barely understand - the surfers surf because its all they want to do; nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing; nor is it a temporary thing - its a lifetime for these guys * buried in the movie is a great history of surfing; i have never surfed but i love surfing movies and have seen many none taught me what this movie did * the movie was very well edited it flowed well the interviews were outstanding * its interesting from start to finishin summary its about as good as a documentary as i have seen so i have to rate in terms of that so 1010<SEP>1
a dreary and pointless bit of fluff bloody fluff but fluff badly scripted with inane and wooden dialogue you do not care if the characters indeed even if the actors themselves live or die little grace or charm little action little point to the whole thing perhaps some of the set and setting will interest--those gaps between the boards of all the buildings may be true to the way life was lived the framework encounter is unnecessary and distracting and the hoppalong cassidy character himself is both boring and inept<SEP>0
fear of a black hat is a superbly crafted film i was laughing almost continuously from start to finish if you have the means i highly recommend viewing this movie it is by far the funniest movie i have had the pleasure to experience grab your stuff!<SEP>1

i bought this game on ebay having heard that it was a similar game to elite the gameplay is indeed very similar and is very addictive once id played it a couple of times i immediately went back on ebay and bought copies for all my kids so they could join in the fun too i have played this game right through and the storyline makes it feel as if you are actually in a movie its brilliant if you have trouble feeling free to explore because of the restrictive nature of the storyline in the single-player game simply set up a freelancer server on your own pc easy to do and the software is included and play to your hearts content there are still a huge number of freelancer servers on the internet so multiplayer is no problem and is not all that threatening because you dont often meant other players unless you want to so go get a copy of this game learn it by playing the single-player campaign then set up an online presence and enjoy yourself the depth of this game is staggering with huge systems to explore and wrecks to find as well as all sorts of other things to discover - hidden planets wormholes secret bases the list is nearly endless fantastic game and especially as you can get it for a couple of quid on ebay get one with the full written manual if you can blue box not xplosiv red box its loads better!<SEP>1

othello the classic shakespearen story of love betrayal lies and tragedy i remember studying this story in high school actually i found othello to be probably my favorite shakespeare story due to the fact of how fascinating it was the fact that shakespeare captured the feeling of friendship love and racism perfectly i mean when you really do study this story you could go into so many philosophies on why othello went insane with jealousy in the blink of an eye but later on for my report i also watched this version of othello and i have to say that it was absolutely brilliant lawerance and kenneth just capture the story so well and understood its darknessothello is the big time soldier in his city he is loved by everyone including the king but when the king finds out that othello snuck off with his daughter desdemona the king is infuriated but excepts it othello is welcome in the city and makes his best friend cassio his side man instead of iago who has stood by othello due to his insane jealousy hes out for revenge still pretending to be othellos best friend he just mearly hints at othello that desdemona is cheating on him with cassio never says that they are just makes othello think that its happening othello is driven insane and doesnt have pleasant plans for desdemona or cassio and iago is more than happy to help him outothello is an incredible story i highly recommend that you read it its an incredible story that keeps you thinking after youve read it othello the movie is also great and once again i recommend it it captured the story perfectly and has a big tearjerker type of feel or you could just be in utter shock of what happens between othello and desdemona how quickly he believes that his true love would betray him this is a terrific movie great acting good sets and good direction this is what shakespeare meant when he wrote the story1010<SEP>1
i was pleased to see that she had black hair! ive been a fan for about 30 years now and have been disgusted at the two earlier attempts to film the storiesi was pleased that the screenwriters updated the period to include a computer it didnt spoil it at all in fact i watched the film twice in one day a sure sign that it was up to standard this is what i do with books that i like as welli thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of modesty blaise extremely well as evinced in both book and comic strip i would also have to disagree with a comment made by an earlier reviewer about baddies having to be ugly has he actually read the booksi thought this was a very good film and look forward to sequels with anticipation<SEP>1
absolutely one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time! it starts off badly and just deteriorates katherine heigl is woefully miscast in a lolita role and leo grillo manfully struggles with what is essentially a cardboard cutout character the only cast-member with any enthusiasm is tom sizemore who hams it up as a villain and goes completely overboard with his role the script is dire the acting horrible and it has plot holes big enough to drive a double-decker bus through! it is also the most sexist movie i have ever seen! katherine heigls character is completely unsympathetic shes seen as an evil wanton seductress who lures the poor innocent married man to cheat on his wife it is implied throughout the movie that shes underage and the message that accompanies that plot-strand just beggars belief! at the end she isnt even able to redeem herself by shooting the man whos obviously ha! become demented with rage and guilt but the script allows him to kill himself thereby redeeming himself in the eyes of males everywhere horrible dont waste your time<SEP>0
i wasted 575 to see this crappy movie so i just want to know a few things:what was the point of the dog being split in half at the beginning of the movie the disease had nothing to do with being split in halfwhat was the point of dragging karen into the shed she already totally infected her room they could have just locked her in there where she would have been saferwhy would the hermit be running around the forest asking strangers to help him when he could have just asked his relative the hog lady to take him to the hospitalwhy didnt any of the characters bother to walk into town to get help when things started getting bad are they all really that lazyeven if paul was threatened by the guy w the shotgun for peeping on his wife paul could have just sent jeff or bert back to the house to ask for help the girl he loves is deterioratingwhat was the point of the boxwhy did jeff go back to the cabin after he left when everyone else was getting infected if he was that big of a jerk to leave in the first place wouldnt he have just gone back homeif the police went to all the trouble of gathering up the kids and burning them on the fire pit why did they throw paul halfway into the river it wasnt even necessary for the plot because the water was already contaminatedwho makes lemonade out of river water that crap has dirt leaves and bugs in it why couldnt the two kids have just use the tap water it was contaminated too so the stupid ending would still work<SEP>0
left behind is an incredible waste of more than 17 million dollars the acting is weak and uninspiring the story even weaker the audience is asked to believe the totally implausible and many times laughable plot line and given nothing in return for their good faith not only is the film poorly acted and scripted it is severely lacking in all the technical areas of filmmaking the production design does nothing to help the credibility of the action the effects are wholly unoriginal and flat the lighting and overall continuity are inexcusably awful; even compared to movies with a tenth of the budget however none of this will matter in that millions of families will no doubt embrace the film for its wholesomeness and its religious leanings; and who can blame them however it is unfortunate that they will be forced to accept 3rd rate amatuer filmmaking<SEP>0
i am always wary of taking too instant a dislike to a film look at it a month later and you might see it differently or dig it up after 50 years in a different continent and some cult followers find something stylistically remarkable that went unnoticed at first after sitting through the great ecstasy of robert carmichael at its uk premiere it came as no surprise to me that i found the question and answer session afterwards more interesting than the film itself shane danielsen artistic director of the edinburgh international film festival aided by the films director and producer gave a spirited defence of a movie than received an overall negative response from the audience edinburgh festival audiences are not easily shocked only one person walked out in disgust the criticisms of the film included very articulate and constructive ones from the lay public as well as an actor and a woman who teaches ma film directors this was not an overly shocking film there was a degree of uninterrupted sexual violence but far less extreme than many movies most actual weapon contact was obscured as were aroused genitals the audience disliked it because they had sat through two hours that were quite boring where the acting standards were not high where the plot was poor predictable and drawn out and where they had been subjected to clumsy and pretentious film-making on the promise of a controversial movie metaphors to the war in iraq are contrived over-emphasised and sloppy apart from a general allusion to violence any deeper meaning is unclear; and the fig-leaf reference marquis de sade as one audience member put it seems a mere tokenistic excuse for lack of plot development towards the finalewe have the story of an adolescent who has a certain amount going for him he stands out at school for his musical ability but takes drugs and hangs out with youths who have little or nothing going for them and whose criminal activities extend to rape and violence when pushed robert seems to have a lot of violence locked inside himthe film is not entirely without merit the audience is left to decide how robert got that way: was it the influence of his peers why did all the good influences and concern from parents and teachers not manage to include him in a better approach to life cinematically there is a carefully-montaged scene where he hangs back whether through too much drugs shyness a latent sense of morality or just waiting his turn several of his friends are raping a woman in a back room partly glimpsed and framed in the centre of the screen in the foreground of the bare bones flat a dj is more concerned that the girls screams interrupt his happy house music than with any thought for the woman ultimately he is a bit annoyed if their activities attract police attention the stark juxtaposition of serious headphones enjoyment of his music even when he knows a rape is going on points up his utter disdain in a deeply unsettling way robert slumps with his back to us in the foregroundbut the rest of the film including its supposedly controversial climax involving considerable if not overly realistic sexual violence is not up to this standard some people have had a strong reaction to it the filmmakers stated intention: if they vomit we have succeeded in producing a reaction but mostly - and as far as i can tell the edinburgh reaction seems to mirror reports from cannes - they feel why have programmers subjected us to such inferior quality film-making director clay hugh can talk the talk but has not developed artistic vision his replies about holding up a mirror to life to tell the truth about things that are swept under the carpet even his defence that there is little plot development because he didnt want to do a standard hollywood movie - all are good answers to criticisms but unfortunately they do not apply to his film any more than they do to holding up a mirror while someone defecates or wastes film while playing ineptly with symbols wanting to try and give him the benefit of any lingering doubt i spoke to him for a few minutes after the screening but i found him as distasteful as his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more substantial there are many truths one aspect of art is to educate another to entertain another to inspire i had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mentions ken loach one of the many great names he takes in vain without going so far as to admit any agenda himself he then falls back on his mantra about his job being to tell the truth i am left with the feeling that this was an overambitious project for a new director or else a disingenuous attempt to put himself on the map by courting publicity for second rate workandy warhol could paint a tin of soup and it was art clay hugh would like to emulate the great directors that have made controversial cinema and pushed boundaries sadly his ability at the moment only extends to making high-sounding excuses for a publicity-seeking film<SEP>0
the godfather of television but aside from its acclaim and mobster characters the two are nothing alike tony soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks his psychiatrist learns that tony is actually part of two families -- in one family he is a loving father yet not-so-perfect-husband and in the other family he is a ruthless wiseguy after analysis dr melfi concludes that tonys problems actually derive from his mother livia whos suspected to have borderline-personality disorder gandolfini is rightfully praised as the main character; yet bracco and marchand arent nearly as recognized for their equally and talented performances as the psychiatrist and mother respectively falco imperioli and dematteo are acclaimed for their brilliant supporting roles van zandt from the e-street band plays his first and only role as tonys best friend and is quite convincing and latching chianese the only recurring actor to have actually appeared in a godfather film plays tonys uncle and on-and-off nemesis many fans also enjoyed characters played by pastore ventimiglia curatola proval pantoliano lip sciorra and buscemi tonys children are okay but not notable with the exception of ilers stunning performance in the third-to-last episode the second coming; sirico and schirripa are unconvincing and over-the-top but the show is too strong for them to hold it back even as the show continues for over six season it ceases to have a dull or predictable moment**** out of four<SEP>1
haha! you have to just smile and smile if you actually made it all the way through this movie it like says something about myself i guess the movie itself was created i think as some sort of psychological test or like some sort of drug to take you to a place you have never been before when wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical piece the tractacus sp he said it was meaningless and useless but if you read it after you were done it would take you to a new level like a ladder and then you could throw away the work and see things with clarity and true understanding this movie is the same i thinkas a movie it is without a doubt the worst movie i have seen in a long long time in such a unique way first of all this is snipes i loved watching this guy kick ass in various movies and i have suffered through a few weak ones however although you know the movie might suck you would never suspect that it could be as bad as it actually was which is the fun of it i mean this is snipes you know it might be good but it will be alright right smileso this thing on every level is pure boredom pure unoriginality the reference to the professional is both dead on and obvious yet so poorly done as to be comical there is not one character in this movie that is interesting in the least and to make the whole thing more surreal they have a soundtrack that sort of sounds like parts to various bourne identity type movies only isnt quite right in fact although it seems close to action movie background music it just so happens it is done in a manner that will grate on you fantasticallythen all the scenes in the total pitch black where honestly since the characters are so flat you dont really care whats going to happen but regardless after it happens and someone is killed you just say to yourself was i supposed to see that what else how about scenes with blinding obnoxious flashing at a strobe lights pace for a period of time that is too long to bear sure lets throw that in how bout this though when you are straining and your eyes cant handle it any longer do some more of these in the dark kills where you really dont see what happened and on top of that lets face it you dont care you were past bored way from the beginningso i drifted in and out a couple times but i caught almost all of this movie and it becomes something you can watch without something that engages your mind on any level therefore it becomes something you can effectively zone out with and begin to think about your life where its going where its been what we are as peopleand that that is the true magic of this film<SEP>0
not to mention easily pierce brosnons best performance of course greg kinnear is always great really when has he really been bad i think this film is incredibly underrated! the use of colors in this movie is something very different in todays film world where every other movie has the payback blue filter i also love the way they used the song by asia proving that even what was once thought of as kinda cheesy can be really cool placed correctlyi was making my first feature when this came out being that my film was a hit-man movie i had to check out anything in the genre that was released after seeing it im sure it had some effect on me through the process it was pretty cool when my film got on the imdb that it would recommend this film if you liked mine how any of the others relate i have no idea making an even more interesting coincidencehttp:wwwimdbcomtitlett1337580<SEP>1
its very sad that lucian pintilie does not stop making movies they get worse every time niki and flo 2003 is a depressing stab at the camera its unfortunate that from the many movies that are made yearly in romania the worst of them get to be sent abroad eg chicago international film festival this movie without a plot acting or script is a waste of time and money score: 002 out of 10<SEP>0
this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen the dvd was given to me free with an order i placed online for non dvd related itemsno wonder they were given away surely no one could part with money for this drivelhow some reviewers can say they found it hilarious beggars belief the person who includes it in the worst five films ever has got it spot onhow on earth a talented actor like philip seymour hoffman could get involved in this rubbish is unbelievable mostly toilet humour and badly done at thatanyone wanting to be entertained should avoid this at all costs<SEP>0
to call a film about a crippled ghost taking revenge from beyond the grave lame and lifeless would be too ironical but this here is an undeniably undistinguished combination of gaslight 1939 & 1944 via les diaboliques 1954; while still watchable in itself its so cliché-ridden as to provoke chuckles instead of the intended chills however thanks to the dire straits in which the british film industry found itself in the late 1970s even a mediocre script such as this one was able to attract 10 star names - cliff robertson as the conniving husband jean simmons in the title role jenny agutter as robertsons artist half-sister simon ward as the enigmatic chauffeur ron moody as an ill-fated doctor michael jayston as robertsons business partner judy geeson as simmons best friend and jaystons wife flora robson as the housekeeper david tomlinson as the notary reading simmons will and most surprisingly perhaps jack warner as a gravestone sculptor - although most of them actually have nothing parts im sorry to say!<SEP>0
after having red the overwhelming reviews this film got in my country i but wanted to see it but - what a disappointment! to see a bunch of one-dimensional characters in a plot that lacks of originality is not worth the money and the time to spend i sometimes wonder about the filmcritics in switzerland<SEP>0
ive only ever seen this film once before about ten years ago i bought the dvd two days ago and after watching it i think it is even better than i remembered it to bepaperhouse is much more than just a horror it had such an amazing level of emotion and great characterisation running through it i especially thought charlotte burke was really excellent here its such a pity that she hasnt done anything else as she was an excellent actress altogether her portrayal of emotion throughout the film was perfect with just the right amount of subtlety to get the message across especially at the end when she realised that although marc had died she knew he was going to be alrightseveral scenes did make me jump which is a rarity for me in modern horror films most notably the scene in the bathtub the scene where annas father was chasing her with the weird radio in the background and the bit where the legs broke apart and crumbled to dustall in all an excellent and very moving film<SEP>1
this movie documents a transformative experience for a group of young men and the experience of watching it is in itself transformative for the viewer few movies even aspire to this level of transcendence and i can think of no other movie -- documentary or drama -- that achieves it there is no other movie in which i have both laughed so much and cried so much yes it is about dmd and accessible travel; on those issues alone it is a worthwhile venture but it is more it is about friendship it is about life itself about living every day that youre alive and its a great fun adventurous narrative this is why god created the cinema! see this movie!!!<SEP>1
the good earth is not a great film by any means it is way to ordinary maybe it was different in the 1930s but who would want to see the life of a farmer it is not very interesting to me yes luis rainer and paul muni do an excellent job acting but the film dragged on way too long i could have told you the ending of this movie by the first act in short wang lung muni a small time farmer who does not want to be like his own father turns out exactly like him both falling in love with their wives just as they are on their death beds the film does a complete 360 going from one generation to the next also this film did not have any good character actors or funny moments it just was depressing stuff about lasting as a farmer during a time of crisis<SEP>0
the film was written 10 years back and a different director was planning it with srk and aamir in lead rolesthe film finally was made now with vipul shah directing it and ajay and salman starring together after a decade hum dil de chuke sanam1999the movie however falls short due to its 90s handling and worst its loopholesthe film tries to pack in too many commercial ingredients and we also hav the love triangleeverything is predictable and filmy and too clichédthere are loopholes like how ajay runs away from london airport and makes a place for himself with no one even the way he starts his band is not convincing the second half gets better with the twist in the tale of ajay destroying salman but sadly the climax falls short and the film ends on a bad notedirection by vipul shah is ordinary to below average music is the worst point most songs are mediocreamongst actors ajay gives his best shot though he isnt convincing as a rock singer yet he does superb as the negative role salman however irritates with his punjabi and talking nonsense he only impresses when he gets drugged and thereon asin is nothing great just a show piece ranvijay should stick to mtv om puri is okay<SEP>0
i saw this in the theater when it came out and just yesterday i saw it again on cable this i was able to reacquainted myself with the feeling of just how revolting this film is the whole bunch of characters are self-absorbed narcisstic preeners worst of all it reinforces every negative stereotype about 20-something dating even as it purports to celebrate people finding themselves the nice guys finish last the jerky guys make out great the jerkiest guys do best the girls are all boy toy pushovers only one character wendy is seen doing anything remotely useful to society and she dispenses with her long-saved virginity in a throwaway one-night stand with a scumbag in a lushly filmed scene that were supposed to think is romantic what this really is is hollywoods concept of young america: permissive detached promiscuous conceited<SEP>0
this story is told and retold and continues to be retold in every possibly way imagine the immortal charles dickens story has been recreated in every possible way imagine i admit i have not seen the classic alistair sim version and im sure someday i will but i would be blown away if it touched even close to this amazing eighties version i believe that if dickens himself had created his story for film this would be itthe story is well known i wont go into much detail because everyone has seen it in one form or another a rich stingy mean old man is visited by the ghost of his former partner and warned about his mean ways in order to straighten him out he is visited by three spirits each which show him a different perspective of his life and the people he is involved with past present and future finally in seeing all this before him he realizes the error of his ways in a big way and attempts retribution for all the wrong he has donegeorge c scott is absolutely undeniably perfect for this role he takes hold of the ebeneezer scrooge role and makes it his own and creates an incredible character he is not just a mean old man but someone who has been effected by certain situations in his life that has made him bitter and angry at the world there is compassion within him but he holds it below everything else and is very self involved scott delivers the role of perfection when it comes to scroogenot only does the leading role make this film but everything else fits into place this is a grand epic of victorian england dickens england is recreated before our very eyes the sights and the sounds and you can almost feel the breeze in your face and the smells of the market director clive donner brilliantly recreates this scene and leaves nothing to the imagination i could watch this film on mute and be dazzled by the scenery its not spectacular scenery per se but its real the film takes us from the high class traders market to the very dismal pits of poverty and everything in betweenthe rest of the cast fits into their roles and brings their literary counterparts to life bob cratchitt played by david warner and his entire family including and especially the young tiny tim played by anthony walters were wonderful the ghosts each had their own distinct personality and added to the dark mood of this story a christmas carol is not a light story dickens wrote this story for a dark period in englands life and its one of the few christmas tales that is really dark almost scary and it has to be scary in order to scare a man who has been a miser for so many years into turning around the dark feel to the story is captured in this film and is downright frightening and yet the end lifts your spirits and captures christmas miracles the score to this film is also something to be mentioned as it is epic and grand and beautiful to listen to whether its the actual score or the christmas music everything fits together apparently christmas movies are my favorite because i insist everyone see this christmas carol above all others 1010<SEP>1
i can not believe such slanted jingoistic material is getting passed off to americans as art house material early on from such telling lines like we want to make sure they are playing for the right team and manipulative framing and lighting a love divided shows its true face the crass manner in which the irish catholics are shown as hegemonic the protestants as peaceful and downtrodden is as poor a representation of history as early us westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and american indians the truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the irish catholics in the story; a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves! it is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for its obvious intent so far from attempting art this film has no business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library<SEP>0
dark remains is a home run plain and simple the film is full of creepy visuals and scares that will make the most seasoned horror veteran jump straight out of there seat the staircase scene in particular these guys are good although they werent working on a huge budget everything looks good and the actors come through dark remains does have one of those interpretive endings which may be a negative for some but i guess it makes you think cheri christian and greg thompson are spot on as the grieving couple trying to rebuild there lives however some side characters like the sheriff didnt convince me they arent all that important anyways i give dark remains a perfect ten rating for being ten times scarier than any recent studio ghost story japanese remake<SEP>1
only seen season 1 so far but this is just great!! a wide variety of people stuck on a island nobody are who they seem to be and everybody seems to have loads of skeletons in their closets it sounds like melrose place meets the crusoe family and why is that so great it probably is not but then ad a spoon full of x files a dose of what and a big hey and a island that is everything you ever dreamed of - in your freakiest nightmares and youll be lost to the story got so many twists and turns it is unbelievable great set up solid acting with a liberating acceptance that at the end of the everybody is human well almost everybody i think with good and bad sides but weird oh so weird<SEP>1
i didnt at all think of it this way but my friend said the first thing he thought when he heard the title midnight cowboy was a gay porno at that point all i had known of it was the reference made to it in that seinfeld episode with jerry trying to get kramer to florida on that bus and kramers all sick and with a nosebleedthe movie was great and surprisingly upbeat and not all pissy pretentious pessimistic like some movies i cant even remember because theyre all crapthe plot basically consisted of a naive young cowboy joe buck going to new york trying to be a hustler a male prostitute basically thinking itll be easy pickings only to hit the brick wall hard when a woman ends up hustling him charging him for their sexual encounterthen he meets enrico salvatore rizzo called ratso by everyone and the cute gay guys who make fun of him all the time you think of him as a scoundrel but a lovable one like han solo or lando calrissian and surprisingly he and joe become friends and the movie is so sweet and heartwarming watching them being friendlier and such and such rizzo reveals himself to actually be a sad pitiable man whos very sick and very depressed and self-conscious hates being called ratso and wants to go to florida where he thinks life will be much better and all his problems resolved and hell learn to be a cook and be famous thereits heartwarming watching joe do all that he does to get them both down to florida along with many hilarious moments like ratso trying to steal food at that hippie party and getting caught by the woman who says gee well you know its free you dont have to steal it and he says well if its free then i aint stealin it and that classic moment completely unscripted and unscheduled where hoffman almost gets hit by that taxi and screams hey im walkin here! im walkin here! and the acting is so believable youd never believe joe buck would grow up to be the distinguished and respected actor jon voight and ratso rizzo would grow up to be the legendary and beloved dustin hoffman its not the first time theyve worked together in lead roles but the chemistry is so thick and intensethen theres the sad part that i believe is quite an overstatement to call it depressing ratso rizzo is falling apart all throughout the movie can barely walk barely eat coughs a lot is sick and reaches a head-point on the bus on its way to florida hes hurting badly and only miles away from miami he finally dies on the bus the bus driver reassures everyone that nothings wrong and continues on sad but not in the kind of way thatd make you go home and cry and mope around miserably as though youve just lost your dog of 13 yearsall in all great movie and the soundtrack pretty much consists just of everybodys talking played all throughout the movie at appropriate times an odd move but a great one as the song is good and fits in with the tone of the movie perfectly go see it its great go buy it<SEP>1
i havent written a review on imdb for the longest time however i felt myself compelled to write this! when looking up this movie i found one particular review which urged people not to see this film do not pay any attention to this ignorant person! nothing is a fantastic film full of laughs and above all imagination! arent you sick and tired of being force fed the same old cycle of bubble-gum trash movies sometimes a film like nothing comes along and gives you something you have never seen before i dont even care if you dislike even hate the movie but no one has a right to discredit the film imdb has a monumental impact on reputations and no negative review should discredit the film like that just say you hate it and why you hate it but dont try to tell people that they shouldnt watch it we have minds of our own and will make up our own minds thank youif my judgment is any good id say that more people will enjoy this movie as opposed to those who hate ittreat your mind to a bit of eye-candy! see nothing!<SEP>1

the original book of this was set in the 1950s but that wont do for the tv series because most people watch for the 1930s style ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the underground can play at that game too hanging the storyline on a plot about the jarrow march was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so i suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing all the stuff about japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time this would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show it is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content<SEP>0
i loathed this film the original phantasm had such wonderful ambiance and mystery like many 70s horror flicks it looked and felt like some creepy unfinished documentary phantasm ii from the late 80s pumped up the action but maintained this nice attention to mood sadly phantasm iii is just awful it tediously explains all of the weird happenings in the previous films which diminishes rather than expands their power it shamelessly degrades imagery from the first phantasm like a cheap reenactment of the original there are so many flying spheres in this movie that they seem more like household pests than menacing death orbs hundreds hang from the ceiling like christmas balls swaying in the draft didnt anyone-- the prop master the dp the editor the director-- notice or care that they looked so crummy even worse phantasm iii presents one corny unfunny joke after another how different from the intensity of the first film the original phantasm used humor to relieve its relentless focus on death phantasm iii uses death to set up countless cheap jokes about reggies horniness: several refer to the films flying balls ha-ha oh i get it balls maybe the crew got a kick out of these jokes but they are on us<SEP>0
i think that this is possibly the funniest movie i have ever seen robert harlings script is near perfect just check out the quotes section; on second thought just rent the dvd since its the delivery that really makes the lines singsally field gives a comic over-the-top performance like youve never seen from her anywhere else and kevin kline is effortlessly hilarious robert downey jr is typically brilliant and in a very small role kathy najimy is a riot as the beleaguered costumer i was never much of a fan of elisabeth shue but shes great here as the one *real* person surrounded by a bevy of cartoon characters on the set of the sun also sets -- that rumbling you feel beneath you is hemingway rolling over in his grave either that or hes laughing really hardfive stars funny funny funny<SEP>1
what a muddled mess i saw this with a friend a while ago and we both consider ourselves open-minded to the many wonders of cinema but this sure isnt one of themwhile there very well could be some good ideasconcepts and there are certainly some good performances under the circumstances it is all buried under random nonsense sir anthony draws way too heavily from the same gene pool as natural born killers u turn and similar films as far as the editing is concerned or maybe he watched himself in nixon for inspiration say what you want about david lynch but at least he more often than not has a method to the madnesshis quote of stating that he made the film as a joke says it all its not worth your money bandwidth or time<SEP>0
i grew up watching the original disney cinderella and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little wornaccordingly i was excited to see that cinderella 2 was coming on tv and i would be able to see iti should have known betterthis movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have just been left alone it holds absolutely none of the originals super charm! it seems to me quite rough and almost brutal right from the dontsing-a-longs to the characterizationwhile i remember the characters telling a story through a song this films soundtrack was laid over the top and didnt seem to fit jaqs transformation into a human is a prime example: where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall! and in the ballroom theres old barn dance type country music its as though the writers forgot where and when this story was set the upbeat fiddles certainly didnt fiteven the artwork and animation in cinderella 2 isnt up to scratch with the original the artwork in this film seems quite raw and less detailed and we see part of cinderellas hoop skirt which doesnt feel rightthe movie itself could have been its own story i think that it should have been just that i wouldnt say that i hate it but i believe that it had many shortcomings it seems to downgrade in a significant way from the beloved cinderella original<SEP>0
this movie is one of my all time favorites cary grant victor mclaglen and douglas fairbanks jrwhat a cast not to mention sam jaffe as gunga din drama action adventure and comedy all rolled up into one the final battle scene still to this day gives me chills and the ending always leaves me in tears if you havent seen it id strongly recommend it<SEP>1
filmed by mgm on the same sets as the english version but in german garbos second portrayal of anna christie benefited from practice and her apparent ease with german dialog garbo appears more relaxed and natural under jacques feyders direction than under clarence browns and her silent movie mannerisms have all but disappeared which made her transition to sound complete the strength she brought to the character remains here although it has been softened and garbo reveals more of annas vulnerability the entire cast with the exception of garbo is different from the previous version of the film and garbo benefits from not having to compete with marie dressler who stole every scene she was in during the english-language version in feyders film garbo holds the center of attention throughout although the three supporting players particularly the father gave excellent performancesfeyders direction was more assured than clarence browns and his use of the camera and editing techniques did not seem as constrained by the new sound process as did those of brown the film moves with more fluidity than the english language adaptation and the static nature of the first film has been replaced with a flow that maintains viewer interest even william daniels cinematography seems improved over his filming of the brown version he captured garbos luminescence and the atmospherics of the docks with style also the screenplay adaptation for the european audience made annas profession quite clear from the start and the explicitness clarifies for viewers who were unfamiliar with the play as to what was only implied in the brown filming however the film was made before the production code was introduced which made the censorship puzzlinggarbos oscar nomination for anna christie was always somewhat mystifying and i suspected that the nod was given more in recognition of her relatively smooth transition to sound films than for her performance however some of the academy voters may have seen the german-language version of the film and they realized as will contemporary viewers that her anna christie under feyders direction was definitely oscar worthy<SEP>1
the dancing was probably the only watchable thing about this film -- and even that was disappointing compared to some other films my gawd!to me this is the worst kind of film -- one that assumes its a work of art because it has all the trappings of film-as-art yes its beautifully photographed but ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film supposedly surrounds itself tango is a tease its hot it has drama its audacious -- precisely what this film is not<SEP>0
the goal of any james bond game is to make the player feel like he is fulfilling an ultimate fantasy: step into the shoes of agent 007 frwl comes closer to this goal than any other game because this time you control the real james bond no offense to pierce brosnan who made a fantastic bond and loaned his voice and likeness to eon but sean connery was the original james bond and there will never be anyone who comes close to his level of cooli must say at this point like many others who have reviewed this game that sean 70 year old voice doesnt fit his 30 year old image on screen and this takes some getting used to but its certainly worth it he makes lines like bond james bond and shaken not stirred into a big deal again but controlling sir sean as he takes on the evil organization known as octopus is as bond said in octopussy only the tip of the tentacle the awesomeness of the game begins with the opening gun barrel its the original gun barrel from the movies then you take on first mission rescuing the prime ministers hottie blonde daughter from terrorists at parliament and everything from the cars to the clothes is perfectly retro the world of the game is truly the world of the original james bond right down to the classic rock-n-roll rendition of the james bond theme that finally plays during a key moment late in the game as bond infiltrates a secret factoryafter the games opening the plot faithfully follows the plot of the movie frwl james bond is sent to turkey to retrieve a lektor device from a russian cipher clerk who claims she has a crush on him in turkey bond teams up with lovable sidekick kerim bey bond must retrieve the device protect the damsel in distress and get both safely back to london bond screenwriter bruce feirstein worked on the script and hes done a good job of making the game the same but different to the movie the characters from the movie are all recreated well but some are better than others the impersonators voicing villains rosa klebb and red grant are uncanny and theres a moment early on in the game where you interact with a miss moneypenny m and q who all look and behave as they did in the original sean connery 007 movieswhat puts this game miles ahead of the other bond games besides sir seans voice and likeness is two notable features in the game play one is bond focus while you can dispatch villains simply by locking onto them with one button and killing them with the other an additional button push will allow you to zoom in closer on a target and choose between spots bond would shoot at such as a grenade attached to a belt that will dispatch an enemy and a few of his friend or a rappel cord that will cause a suspended enemy to plunge to his death the other notable feature is the stealth and mêlée kills when youre in close enough range just hit a button to beat down an enemy with the raw brutality that only sean connerys james bond displayedsean connerys bond relied mostly on his raw wit and talent so you only have a few gadgets but theyre good ones the q-copter is a remote control helicopter that can self-destruct and explore areas bond cant reach like the q-spider in eon only better the classic laser watch is useful not just for getting into sealed rooms but dispatching enemies when you have no other weapon available sonic cuff links and a serum gun are the most fun to play around with but you must experience them for yourself besides the gadgets you can go dress bond up in a number of retro costumes found during the game including the gray suit from the movie the standard black tuxedo a retro stealth suit and that classic white tuxedo all which look exactly like they did when sir sean wore them in the movies when you drive in the game you drive the aston martin db5 straight out of goldfinger it cant turn invisible but it has a gadget for popping tires like in the movie and when youre not flying down the streets of istanbul in the goldinger car you can fly through the air in the thunderball jet packthen theres the multi-player of course it has to be compared to the standard of the goldeneye game and it fails also you can only play bond villains rather than bond himself or the other heroes of the game but the multi-player is amusing and a decent bonus since the awesomeness of the single player campaign alone makes the game worth playing the basic game does have other flaws some of the movies most exciting moments particularly the gypsy camp shootout bonds brawl with red grant on the orient express and a confrontation between bond and rosa klebbs bladed shoe arent done justice in game form and the game is a fast play even on the hardest difficulty but overall this game is the best james bond experience so far<SEP>1
i liked the movie a real lot wanted to see it just for dara tomanovich but the plot and story were ok too a very cool change in plot when you least expect it<SEP>1
i simply cant get over how brilliant the pairing of walter matthau and jack lemmon is its like the movie doesnt even need additional characters because you can never get tired of the dialog between these twolemmon had already been in several well-known films like mr roberts and the apartment and matthau was fresh off his oscar win for the fortune cookie another billy wilder film also with lemmon that particular movie wasnt as great as this one because the story couldnt sustain such a long running time i think it was almost 2 hours however this goes by at a brisk hour and a half even though the introduction of the events leading up to lemmon ending up at matthaus apartment is a tad long so was this sentence thats a minor quibble though and for the rest of the running time you have a marvelous timei have already written a comment about how the follow-up to this film sucked and i wont go deeper into that the reason why this is such a joy is probably that the movie was made just as the innocence of american movies was beginning to fade fast into oblivion there are some sexual references but they are dealt with in such an innocent way that you couldnt even get a well i never out of the most prudish person out there it is kind of fun to see a movie from a long lost era and that was probably why the sequel didnt work because you had matthau and lemmon say quite a few f-words and that just doesnt fit themof course now they are both gone and you can just be happy that you still can enjoy them in a marvelous film like this i think the only male actor in this film who is still alive is john fiedler edelman died recently so there you have it simply one of the best comedies and films everadd: i have just learned recently that john fiedler has died so to all the fans of him i am deeply sorry i didnt mean any disrespect and i will try to be more careful of what i am blah blah blahing next time<SEP>1
many things become clear when watching this film: 1 the acting is terrible tom hanks and wendy crewson are so-so but the parent-child conflict borders soap opera-ish the other two boys: an overly pouty child prodigy and your stereotypical im-a-babe-but-im-really-sensitive-inside blonde dreamboat; 2 the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing; 3 robbies dreams and episodes are disturbing acted by tom hanks; 4 the inclusion of the beginning love ballads is an odd choice we are all special friends; 5 the weird lines and side plots are not made any better by the terrible acting; and 5 this is a really bad movie expect to be disappointed--and probably disturbed<SEP>0
a dog found in a local kennel is mated with satan and has a litter of puppies one of which is given to a family who has just lost their previous dog to a hit & run the puppy wants no time in making like donald trump and firing the mexican housekeeper how festive only the father suspects that this canine is more then he appears the rest of the family loves the demonic pooch so its up to dad to say the daythis late 70s made for tv horror flick has little going for it except a misplaced feeling of nostalgia when i saw this as a kid i found it to be a tense nail-biter but revisiting it as an adult i now realize that its merely lameboring and not really well-acted in the least bitmy grade: d<SEP>0
i sat through almost one episode of this series and just couldnt take anymore it felt as though id watched dozens of episodes already and then it hit metheres nothing new here! ive heard that joke on seinfeld i saw someone fall like that on friends an episode of happy days had almost the same storyline ect none of the actors are interesting here either! some were good on other shows not here and others are new to a profession they should have never entered avoid this stinker!<SEP>0
historical drama and coming of age story involving free people of color in pre civil war new orleans starts off slow but picks up steam once you have learned about the main characters and the real action can begin this is not just a story about the exploitation of black women because these were free people they may not have had all the rights of whites but they certainly had more control over their destinies than their slave ancestors the young men and women in this story must each make their own choice about how to live their lives whether to give into the depravity of the system or live with optimism and contribute to their community i enjoyed all of the characters but my favorites were christophe anna bella and marcel<SEP>1
slackers is just another teen movie thats not really worth watching dave devon sawa sam jason segel and jeff michael c maronna are about to graduate from holden university with honors in lying cheating and scheming the three roommates have proudly scammed their way through the last four years of college and now during final exams these big-men-on-campus are about to be busted by the most unlikely dude in school the plot is very stupid and theres no reason why to watch this unless your looking to shut off you brain for a little while slackers is just a predictable teen flick that really adds nothing new to the genre the comedy in slackers is either hit or miss but theres no real true funny or original moment in the movie its really just a collection of gags and some are actually pretty funny though for every joke that works theres at least eight more that dont the screenplay is full of penis and breast jokes that some high school and college students may enjoy even if they do they probably wont remember this film after awhile as its not a very memorable comedy jason schwartzman plays the freaky ethan and after appearing in some good comedies he has stoop pretty low jaime king and devon sawa are the other main stars but they do a rather poor job in this film this is directed by dewey nicks and this is his first film so you cant blame him too much the funniest character was probably laura prepon though shes not in the movie very much the film is very short at only 86 minutes long however that may be too long for some people who dont really like this type of humor slackers isnt the worst film of 2002 but certainly is below average when compared to other films in the genre theres a lot better out there such as not another teen movie american pie and its sequels scary movie 1 & 2 etc so unless you have seen most of them and youre looking for something new then slackers might fit that bill but its better if you just watch something else rating 4310 a below average teen comedy thats worth skipping<SEP>0
i love this show its sure to be a winner jessica alba does a great job its about time we have a kick-ass girl whos not the cutesy type the entire cast is wonderful and all the episopes have good plots everything is layed out well and thought over to put it together must have taken a while because it wasnt someone in a hurry that just slapped something together its a great show altogether<SEP>1
the movie sucked it wasnt funny it wasnt exciting they tried to make it so bad that it would be good but failed and thinking its cool to like this movie next to the hype are the only reasons that this movie is a successthe fact that at this moment 50% voted a 10 out of 10 for this movie seems pretty concerning to me either the movie going public is going insane or this vote is unrealistic which can have numerous causes and should be dealt with anyway it is a less than average movie which bloomed through mouth to mouth advertising its success can only be described as a marketing marvel<SEP>0
it holds very true to the original manga of the same name aka tramps like us in the us but it can still be enjoyed even if you havent read the manga its a different kind of tail showing a strong and independent woman who hurts just like everyone else however because of her outward strength she fears showing her inner feelings and thus lets those around her hurt her with their blunt comments the only one who truly figures her out and who she can be at ease with is her new pethumanmomo if you want something different than the normal boring stuff with some wonderful j-dorama japanese drama actorsresses then this is definitely the series to watchand read!<SEP>1
even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every significant moment of the 1960s ok so katie didnt join the manson family and nobody died at altamont this movie was still unbelievably awful i got the impression that the writers just locked themselves in a room and watched forrest gump the wonder years and oliver stones 60s films over and over again and called it research a canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode head spinning he was right<SEP>0
definitely the product of young minds this piece may very well appeal to the 20s crowd who is still trying to find their place in the world while obsessing over every neurosis however i cant imagine that the heavy amount of narcissistic navel-gazing trite humor or banal subject matter would be particularly engaging to anyone over 30 another problem is that the peripheral characters whom the filmmakers obviously have nothing but contempt for are hyped up to such absurd caricatures for comic effect that they fail to be relatable in any real way however one has to give some style points to the filmmakers who obviously grew up in the video generation and use every conceivable editing trick in the book in order to spruce up an otherwise non-existent plot there are 2 points to remember here first beware of festival darlings second even though we live in the age of youtube not everyones account of their mundane lives deserves big- screen treatment but these young filmmakers have every right to make their film and if others 20-somethings can find something in it to identify with then all the better yet i could not help but think at the end of this film how this latest generation just now coming of age will fare in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications in the age when every child is constantly reassured of how special they are and that they all deserve their 15 minutes of exposure resiliency and the ability to deal with adversity does not exactly appear to be this generations strong point<SEP>0
curiously season 6 of the columbo series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts based on this outing for the man-in-the-mac and also fade into murderfurthermore it is not a coincidence that peter s feibleman penned both the aforementioned scripts incidentally he plays the part of the murdered security guard herethis adventure is very rarely compelling and many of the performers just look disinterested with the material the story is rather weakly developed with some protracted periods of boring conversationcolumbo is also shadowed by a colleague heresimilar to last salute to the commodore but the entertainment value is minimal to add to this celestes holm characterisation which is intended to provide comedy induces embarrassment rather than laughsthe script wavers off to deal with the family history and the murderess does enough to gift columbo the case though there is never a credible discussion relating to the motives of her crimeironically what turns out to be arguably columbos worst adventure produces the funniest moment in the series he quizzes a male hairdresser and has a haircutmanicure at the same time the next 5 minutes are hilarious - its just that columbos hair is so perfectly groomed then he cant afford to pay the bill and then when he makes enquiries at a jewellers he keeps glancing in the mirror to admire his hairstyle!sadly this is the only decent moment from a script that looks like it has been cobbled together in ten minutes for columbo completionists only<SEP>0
what can i say oh yeah those freaking fingers are so weird they scare the heck out of me but it is such a funny film jim carrey works the grinch if you havent already seen it then what you waiting for an invitation go go and get watch it you dont know what your missing<SEP>1
i remember the original series vividly mostly due to its unique blend of wry humor and macabre subject matter kolchak was hard-bitten newsman from the ben hecht school of big-city reporting and his gritty determination and wise-ass demeanor made even the most mundane episode eminently watchable my personal fave was the spanish moss murders due to its totally original storyline a poortroubled cajun youth from louisiana bayou country takes part in a sleep research experiment for the purpose of dream analysis something goes inexplicably wrong and he literally dreams to life a swamp creature inhabiting the dark folk tales of his youth this malevolent manifestation seeks out all persons who have wronged the dreamer in his conscious state and brutally suffocates them to death kolchak investigates and uncovers this horrible truth much to the chagrin of police captain joe mad dog siskawonderfully essayed by a grumpy keenan wynnand the head sleep researcher played by second city improv founder severn darden to droll understated perfection the wickedly funny harrowing finale takes place in the chicago sewer system and is a series highlight kolchak never got any better timeless<SEP>1
this is another one of those movies that could have been great the basic premise is good - immortal cat people who kill to live etc - sort of a variation on the vampire conceptthe thing that makes it all fall apart is the total recklessness of the main characters even sociopaths know that you need to keep a low profile if you want to survive - look how long it took to catch the unibomber and that was because a family member figured it outby contrast the kid and to a lesser extent the mom behave as though theyre untouchable the kid kills without a thought for not leaving evidence or a trail or a living witness how these people managed to stay alive and undiscovered for a month is unbelievable let alone decades or centuriesits really a shame - this could have been so much more if it had been written plausibly ie giving the main characters the level of common sense they would have needed to get by for so longother than that not a bad showing i loved the bit at the end where every cat in town converges on the house - every time i put out food on the porch and see our cats suddenly rush in from wherever they were before i think of that scene<SEP>0
what an incredible fall for sean ellisyou gather a bunch of your friends at home all hyped about the follow up work of sean ellis you have an vague idea of the plot no spoilers that could kill the fun very high expectationsit is late at night perfect atmosphere for a movie of this type15minutes passes and you start telling yourself it is bound to pick up at 25mins you start wondering if you should just go to sleep and save this for another time when you can fully appreciate the expected not existent subtle touches over the half hour mark you realize half of your your hyped up audience is already asleep and call it a daya few days later when you exhaust all other material to watch you go back to this in the middle of the day this time hoping your mood will keep you awake this time 10 minutes later you find yourself fastforwarding the unbelievably and needlessly long intermediate transitions and images any other stuff i would have given up already but there is cashback and its legacy but that legacy can only carry you so long this is a new level of boring movie-making imagine a short story extended to a novel with just descriptions this is what it isdecent cast is wasted there is no cinematography that leaves you in awe like cashback either there are films that annoy you there are films that lack certain aspects or just cheesy unfortunately this is just a waste of timefinal words stay away<SEP>0
john waters pink flamingos pecker is the best movie ive seen in a while it gives the viewer a surreal image of life in baltimore i live in nearby washington dc with a warhol-like use of color exaggerated motions and emotions pecker becomes larger than his town can handle and he is separated from his loved-ones including a sexy ricci by his man-loving art manager the picture left a refreshing taste in my mouth--kind of like a fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day--and though this taste was rather flat and simplistic it only made the whole thing more profound and critical it is a celebration of life liberty and the right to bear armsand everything else this country stands for -juan pieczanski jpieczanski@sidwelledu<SEP>1

in paris the shy and insecure bureaucrat trelkovsky roman polanski rents an old apartment without bathroom where the previous tenant the egyptologist simone choule dominique poulange committed suicide the unfriendly concierge shelley winters and the tough landlord mr zy melvyn douglas establish stringent rules of behavior and trekovsky feels ridden by his neighbors meanwhile he visits simone in the hospital and befriends her girlfriend stella isabelle adjani after the death of simone trekovsky feels obsessed for her and believes his landlord and neighbors are plotting a scheme to force him to also commit suicide the weird le locataire is a disturbing and creepy tale of paranoia and delusion the story and the process of madness and loss of identity of the lonely trelkovsky are slowly developed in a nightmarish atmosphere in the gruesome location of his apartment and what is happening indeed is totally unpredictable the performances are awesome and isabelle adjani is extremely beautiful my vote is eighttitle brazil: o inquilino the tenant<SEP>1
an idiotic dentist finds out that his wife has been unfaithful so no new story lines here however the authors managed to create a stupid disgusting film if you enjoy watching kids vomiting or seeing a dentist imagining that he is pulling all his wifes teeth out in a bloody horror-type go see or rent the film if not move on to something else my fair lady anyone<SEP>0
the 1990s begun to have day time talk shows sprout up left and right every network had one and they all lacked one thing originality ricky lake was just another show to entertain the obese trailer park mother with a marlboro cigarette hanging out of her mouth while breast feeding one of her dozens of toothless illiterate children the english language and other cornerstones of mankind where ruined by this shows existence titltes ranging from girl you a pigeon head and so on how could anyone want to watch this pure and utter garbage has our society really became nothing more than a bunch of hill billys and dead beat fathers the people who appear on this show were trash the people who watched this show were trash anyone that wishes to see this show re aired or put onto dvd is trash people wonder why americans are becoming huge piles of lard and too fat to even get jobs its having shows like this tell them its ok to be 500lbs overweight and have 12 year old girls act like prostitutes having such trash on tv has ruined morals<SEP>0
there are pretty landscape shots writers putting trite mouthings into actors mouths with lesser actors this show would be silly art must uplift humanity or its bs not so because art of all those mentioned is also to stir humanity and express the dark side the lead character even says those who dont drink hide the shadow side wrong he lived in darkness and repressed his dark side by drinking and being one dimensional not expanding his horizons with something other than landscapes there wasnt a breathing organism in his work nor expression of his pain all the artist did was limit himself to dime a dozen landscapes the discussions between the characters was grade school trite stuff always giving the one character the upper hand the writer wanted i tried to like it after reading all the first wow comments on here i had to dig deep to see those i agreed with i figure the great comments were from those connected to the movie i was moved only once towards the end the kid was way too passive the scenery was nice and the music ridiculous just my opinion but nowhere show for me<SEP>0
a series of shorts spoofing dumb tv shows groove tube hits and misses a lot overall i do really like this movie unfortunately a couple of the segments are totally boring a few really great clips make up for this a predecessor to such classics like kentucky fried movie<SEP>1
i still cant believe this movie they got so much unbelievable things in it that its hard to believe anyone wanted to make itthe story is a joke but in the sense of being funny but more like no story at all how can you mix a slapstick comedy with a train robbery a prison movie town conspiracies sex-jokes and a fbi-agent you cantbeside the terrifying directing the most noticeable thing are the actors i watched this film and thought: is this really marlon brando no it cant be 5 minutes later is this charlie sheen wow maybe brando is true 5 minutes later this cant be donald sutherland 5 minutes later no not mira sorvino this movie is too bad for all of them at the end no no no this cant absolutely not be martin sheen!!! not for 10 seconds of such a movie then it was over and i down with my nerves so many good oscar-winning usually convincing actors in such a stupid dumb awful movie i rarely wanted to know so much how they came to act in this one they couldnt got so much moneyonly just an unbelievable silly idiotic movie310 14 5 1+ - 6-<SEP>0
just a stilted rip-off of the infinitely better murder she wrote it is absolutely amazing that this poorly-written garbage lasted for a full eight years im sure most of the people who watched this unentertaining crap were in their sixties and seventies and just tuned in because they had nothing better to do or simply remembered its star from the old dick van dyke show van dyke who only had a decent career in the 1960s never was much of an actor at all by his own admission and he was already far too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993 he looks absolutely ancient as a result of years of chain smoking and heavy drinking his talentless real life son barry a wooden actor who has rarely been in anything that didnt involve his father plays his son in the series<SEP>0
i must say that i was disapointed with this film i have never been a huge bnl fans i find their songs kind of childish and obsessively nostalgic this is me in grade 9 if i had a million dollars shoe box of life etc however i have seen clips of their live show and i really like the improvisational and goofy nature of the show i was hoping that this movie would highlight this which is unfortunately the most interesting part of the show because their music is well played yet somehow bland and not that compelling there is a standup bass solo in the middle which was completely pointless and boring despite how much jim creegan was digging himself the film does not and shows only a few minutes of it and you know theyve had better moments as in the afgahnistan concert koffee anan hes the man in charge my names steve paige and im really large bnl are kind of like when i went to europe a few years ago and heard that godawfull blue song by effeil 99 or whatever every 2 minutes i came back to canada and then a month later that song was all over the place *again* i nearly chewed off my own arm bnl is like that years ago i remember many a fond memory of sitting around campfires in canada listening to people play if i had a million dollars bnl was a cult phenomenon in canada and much of their humour has a particular canadian slant to it kraft dinner is a staple for many students up here and the name gordon is quintessentially canadian a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and i was somewhat gratefull then all of a sudden they become huge in states and everyone down there thinks they are this brand new band yeah theyre brand new but theyre all in their 30s! while the rest of canada is going oh geez i thought those guys folded years ago do i have to listen to million dollars againthe concert footage is not bad but i would have liked to have seen more of their stage routine the shooting is not that great and things like clips from their massive free show in boston are glazed over much too quickly the interviews are surprisingly dull for such a funny bunch of guys i think theyre all old and they have families and houses and stuff and have settled down a bit there are times when they go into spinal tap type of material where they deliver deadpan satire then they break into laughs and giggles that kind of ruins it the interviews with moses znaimer a canadian media mogule and terry david mulligan music dude are extremely pretentious and verge into tap territory unintentionallythis movie doesnt really document very much either i mean its basically one show and at the start of the film they are already huge and have a massive touring entourage its not like we see them rising from obscurity and surprise they are popular its a methodically planned out event so in the end its rather lifeless kind of half live concert half documentary and not much of either<SEP>0
when we were in junior high school some of us boys would occasionally set off stinkbombs it was considered funny then but the producers directors and cast of semana santa angel of death in the dvd section of your local video rental are adults and they are still setting them offlike the previous reviewer who wondered if the cast were anxious to get off the set and home i doubt more than one take was done for any of the scenesmira sorvino hot in mighty aphrodite and other top-rated films seems to have undersold herself to this project her acting is non-existent confined mostly to wistful stares that are supposed to indicate how sensitive she is to the plight of the films various victimsbut let me warn you--do not be the next victim! step away from the dvd if you find it on the shelf tbere are not many good leg shots of mira the only high points i could find in the film and the supporting cast is of inferior quality delivering a mishmash of badly-done dialogue with embarrassing spanish accents worthy of the best high school theatrical production<SEP>0
another very good mann flick thanks to the fatherson combination of walter brennan and jimmy stewart brennan ben tatum is often the comedic conscience of either stewart or wayne red river rio bravo hes there to see that the younger man takes the ride fork or bend youre wrong mr dunston jeff websterstewart gives off the impression he cares only for himself but it is clear he cannot desert brennan john mcintire is excellent as the law of skagway with due respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it another key theme is helping people and in turn being helped by people the loner can do neither and suffers for itthe caption above plays on tatums assertion that he cant live without his coffee this nicotine addiction proves fatal probably the first and last time on the screeni recommend this film and now own the dvd<SEP>1
i recently watched this film at the 30th gothenburg film festival and to be honest it was on of the worst films ive ever had the misfortune to watch dont get me wrong there are the funny and entertaining bad films eg manos  hands of fate and then there are the awful bad films this one falls into the latter category the cinematography was unbelievable and not in a good way it felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot the lighting was something between one guy running around with a light bulb and non existing the actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them the only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer a classic look a la jason vorhees from friday the 13th the plot was extremely poor and the ending even worse i would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is not supposed be look like or maybe an insomniac needing sleep<SEP>0
wowwhat can i sayfirst off imdb says this is in the late 60swhich means carlito would be very close to going to prison he got out in 75 and said he was in for 5 years they used a bunch of nobody actors and a story that didnt even make sense they bring back only one actor guzman and hes playing a totally different guy why did it end with him and this puerto rican chick wheres gale he said he was in love with her before wheres kleinfeld he said he knew him foreveryoud think hed have been in this one and if this made sense where are rocco and the black dude in the first one it was all just stupidthis is an insult to pacino and the first film<SEP>0

maslin beach is a real nudistnaturist beach south of adelaide on the fleurieu peninsula in south australia it is also the name of an australian film that used the beach as a locationmaslin beach is labelled a romantic comedy this could be slightly misleading as it is not a hilarious film nor is it really romantic in the traditional sense but it does have light-hearted moments much as life itself there are also moments of sadness too it is also entirely shot at the nudist beach mentioned above and nudity runs throughout the length of film the viewer quickly learns to accept this as normal and concentrate on the plot not the copious amount of fleshsimon and marcie michael allen and eliza lovell arrive by car at a beach-side car park they take their belongings to the beach and while they are walking a voice-over from simon talks about his confusion about what real love is the rest of the film is an exploration of this framed by one complete day at the beach the basic story is of what happens to simons love life but there are also many other characters highlighted in several separate vignetteswhen they arrive at the beach both simon and marcie appear bored with each other marcie sees them as a romeo and juliet romantic couple simon is just bored with it all next we are introduced to gail bonnie-jaye lawrence paula zara collins and jenny jennifer ross they are walking down the beach together discussing gails chances of finding the perfect man aided by the powers of a necklace that brought good luck to her grandmother however there are many more interesting people on the beach not all of them attractive and young part of the realism of this filmto service the beachs patrons there is a flatulent short-sighted ice-cream salesperson with a van this is ben gary waddell who is a friend of simon and is also his unofficial counsellor i would think that this character is the main comic element it is hard to say though as there is nothing about ben that would make you laugh aloud unless you were intoxicated male and very young! maslin beach does have a major redeeming feature though and that is that it does not dwell too long on any one subject as the quality of acting is variable the script is suspect and everything about maslin beach is cheap the lack of continuity is a positive boon in fact there is something about this film not the nudity that i find appealing it is hard to define what it is but it could be something to do with its bluntness and downright aussie attitude to carnal mattersthe camera work in maslin beach deserves a mention sometimes it is very good with some stunning static shots and pans of the beach cliffs and a sunset as nudity is a major factor in this film framing is an important aspect of the camera work there is no sense of gratuity in the framing meaning that the framing is done so that the camera does not dwell on private body parts this helps to ease any sense of viewer discomfort from being within the subjects personal space and makes the film more tasteful not an easy task given the location for filmingmaslin beach is neither a skin flick for post-pubescent testosterone charged males nor a mills and boon romance for under-appreciated women maslin beach does not seem to fit anywhere in genre the actors are not attractive in the baywatch sense and are just normal people that you would see on the beach anywhere it does not have a message to put across and it would not even act as a tourism advertisement other than perhaps to naturists apart from the australian accent the filming could have been in any sunny country what makes this film distinctly australian is the fact that it is pointless cinema verite and only australian cinema and other medium sized national cinemas could consider such a rash option at the same time these medium sized cinemas have room for experimentation in the quest for identity and a flop is not going to damage their reputation too much it is always possible given that maslin beach is now a collectors item that the film might become internationally popular but it is very unlikelyduring this critique i have been sounding highly negative at times about maslin beach this is not the real position as i found the film very easy to watch i enjoyed it as a reflection of near reality and real people and problems the problems confronted in the film are those of the everyday and a little low on spectacle this does it no harm in my view and i wish that more films dealt with the everyday like this there is a connection here with the cinemas of europe and with french film in particular they rarely deal with major disasters or catastrophes but with the everyday hollywood is in direct opposition to this and rides the crest of the hyper-real actiondramaangst wave the pace too is much faster in hollywood but it is not reality maslin beach is not exactly jacques tati either but it is on the right track even if it does ignore issues of multi culturalism equality gender orientation and so on that are of such importance in current cinema i am sure that you will either love or hate this film with little room for a middle ground<SEP>1
i basically found edens curve to be a very poorly constructed that made it difficult to watch however there is something i must say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70s in the choice of settings and clothing the back to the earth philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically decadent as portrayed in many later versions of the 70s was right on as was the dont ask dont tell pseudo-liberalism of the fraternity made up of east-coast intellectuals except that i would have thought this was more likely of a new england school rather than one in virginia where i imagine the good ole boy mentality still dominated even elitist schools like this one another thing i appreciated and could relate to is that this was a time when homosexuality was not linked so much to leathermen or drag queens and i appreciated some homosexual roles not related to these terribly overused images i felt it was very unfortunate that gay culture took on certain standard forms in the 80s out of castro and christopher streets and these defined the movement and left out huge numbers of gay men that were more subdued in their lifestyles i appreciated the film mainly as a way of remembering a more natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without the scene<SEP>0
this is yet another tell-it-as-it-is madhur bhandarkar film i am not sure why he has this obsession to show child moles***ion and g*y concepts to the indian filmy audience but i find some of those scenes really disgusting! whats new it is a nice piece put together by bhandarkar where he shows the story of an entertainment reporter played by leading lady in the famous film mr & mrs iyer what makes this movie different is that it also covers the stories of people that this reporter interacts with or is friends with such as her roomies her colleagues film stars models rich people and others featured in the entertainment page#3 in her newspapernoticeable: it is another good performance from mrs iyer she is likely to be noticed for this role she does selective roles but shines in them she is noticeably de-glamorized and less beautiful in this film but then entertainment reporters are not supposed to outshine the people they cover right verdict: madhur has come up with another good movie that brings social issues to the limelight very nicely however this movie loses focus and one is not sure what the director is trying to conveyis he trying to show us the glitz and glamor of the rich people or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and contrasting that with the life of the real crime reporter is he trying to tell us how the government and rich folks rule the press or is he trying to illustrate the issues with child abuse and g*y folk the other concepts brought forth include the unwritten rule that young women have to sleep with directors or co-stars if they wish to enter bollywoodin addition he talks about how flight assistants get sick and tired of their jobs after a while and resort to extreme measures by marrying much elder people etc he also talks about unhappy women and spoilt kids in rich familiesthis was all okay for me but might be too complex for an average movie-goer who just wants to relieve some stress from day to day work<SEP>1
forbidden planet is the best sf film from the golden age of sf cinema and what makes it a great film is its sense of wonder as soon as the spaceship lands the audience - via the ships human crew - travels through an intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventure we meet the unforgetable robbie the mysterious dr morbuis his beautiful and innocent daughter altair and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet - the krell who died out overnight or did they you can nitpick and say the planet is obviously filmed in a movie studio with painted backdrops but that adds to a sense of menace of claustraphobia i feel and bebe and louis barron`s electronic music adds even more atmosphere i`m shocked this film isn`t in the top 250 imdb films<SEP>1
leave it to braik to put on a good show finally he and zorak are living their own lives outside of spac ghost coast to coast i have to say that i love both of these shows a whole lot they are completely what started adult swim brak made it big with an album that came out in the year 2000 it may not have been platinum but his show was really popular to tons of people out there that love adult swims shows i have to say that out of all the adult swim shows with no plot this has to be the one with the most none plot ever made that is why i like it so much it is just such a classic in the adult swim history i believe this is just such a great show if you dont like it hey there were tons who hated it and tons who loved it<SEP>1
i recently watched belle epoque thinking it might be wonderful as it did win an oscar for best foreign language film i was a bit underwhelmed by the predictability and simplicity of the film maybe the conflict i had was that from the time the movie was filmed to now the plot of a man falling for beautiful women and eventually falling for the good girl has been done so many times aside from predictability of the plot some scenes in the film felt really out of place with the storyline ex a certain event at the wedding at times the film was a bit preachy in its ideas and in relation to the franco era the film was set in and the church the only thing the film had going for it was the cutesy moments the scenery and the character of violeta being a strong independent woman during times when women were not really associated with those characteristics<SEP>0
i had the privilege of attending a special screening of the absence of light at a horror convention in ohiofirst off you know youre in trouble when the director introduces a film saying: now keep in mind we didnt have much money not that no-budget films are bad but when a filmmaker uses this as an excuse the results are always poor and there is no better example than this unwatchable sleep-fest actually absence of light marks a first in the world of underground cinema: its the only time ive seen a dream-cast of talented genre vets actually bore me charismatic actors like david hess tony todd and reggie banister randomly enter and exit the movie and prove to be every bit as uninteresting as the amateurish no-names who are their characters what are they talking about who cares its all so dull youll cease to care about anything or anyoneafter thirty minutes of this endurance test i gave up and walked out of the theater not surprisingly so did most of the cast members in attendance any curious genre fans would do well to stay away from this with a little luck this movie wont ever see the light of day<SEP>0
midnight cowboy opens with a run down drive in theater with the voice-over of the main character joe buck jon voight singing in the shower he is singing a cowboy song the very thing he strives to be joe picks up his humdrum life living in texas and moves it to new york city with the dream of lots of women and even more money he dresses as the epitome of the cowboy but in a cartoonish fashion not even his friends take him seriously he begins his journey on the bus to nyc and we can quickly see how diluted joe is through his interactions with the other passengers this is primarily a story of joes realization of the harsh realities of the real worldhe starts off as a very naïve southerner thinking he can make it in nyc just on his good looks he has no other reason to think otherwise as they proved helpful in the past; we learn this from the many flashbacks he has in the beginning the flashbacks are filmed in a way that portrays them as being somewhat whimsical they are hazy and the voices sound as if they are coming from a great distance as they are they are coming out of his past however as joe delves deeper and deeper into the reality of the harsh atmosphere of nyc we see more of his past which is no longer whimsical but gritty filmed in black and white with rapid editing to portray the cruel nature of the past events this is especially seen in the flashback of him and his girlfriend being assaulted and her being raped in one of these flashbacks we see a building being torn down brick by brick this mirrors the way in which joe himself is falling apart; the naiveté that he once carried is falling off of him he and ratso dustin hoffman are living in squalor and barely able to get food to eat; joe is realizing he cannot live off of his looks that there is a gritty underbelly of new york that he didnt envision his subconscious mirrors the way in which his real life is panning outratso is also serves as a kind of mirror to joe but in an opposite way; ratso is joes foil joe is a handsome strong man who for the most part has a good outward appearance ratso on the other hand from the very first time we see him sitting next to joe in the bar we can tell he is the opposite he is short dark and always coated with a sheen of sweat he understands how the world works that it is unforgiving and sometimes no matter how hard you try you will fail; just as his father did they are living in the same world the same apartment even but they understand things on a completely different levelthe theme of alienation one that is common of this era is very apparent in this film neither joe nor ratso fit into the culture surrounding them joe feels trapped in texas and moves to nyc where he is still very much an outsider ratso living in the cold of nyc wishes to move to sunny florida where he thinks he will be able to find a good life even though this is his ideal in the fantasy we get from ratsos perspective it is apparent that he knows he will never really fit into society in said fantasy he is turned on by the people living around him he is yet again an outsider alienated from societyit is not until the end that the gap between joe and ratso begins to narrow joe resorts to violence; he takes on the mentality of this city in order to get money to fund a means of escape for florida for himself and ratso on the journey we see joe coming out of a store not wearing the cowboy clothes that he is never without in the rest of the film he is dressed as someone who looks like they are headed to florida for vacation he dresses ratso the same way; he tires to make them fit into the new society they are entering but it is to no avail upon ratsos death on the bus their fellow passengers once again look them upon as outsiders even in this new culture they have entered they cannot escape the alienation they have met at every turn in this film despite the ratsos death and joes continued alienation the film ends with the hope that joe can take his new knowledge of how the world works and create a better life than he would have had as a hustler in nyc midnight cowboy is an excellent film portraying the harsh reality of society and alienation with stellar performances by both voight and hoffman<SEP>1

i have never seen one of these scifi originals before this was the first i think it only fair to judge the acting directionproduction set design and even the cgi effects on the other scifi movies to compare it to your typical hollywood production is unfair i will say however that overall aztec rex was not exactly reminiscent of werner herzogs masterpiece aguirre wrath of godi will begin by noting that yes i do recognize the fact that this movie has more to do with culture-clash than it does with dinosaurs despite this being a made-for-tv sci-fi movie there is some underlying context to the story which i shall examine the symbolic elements included are evident enoughconsequently as a student of history theology mythology and film: i found the dialogue outrageous and the plot themes to be somewhat insulting i am not asking for any mea culpas on behalf of the producers - as i said before the movie is what it is but what concerns me is that much of the younger demographic for this movie probably rely on television to provide them their lessons when it comes to history and cultural diversitythe main problem manifests itself most visibly with the character ayacoatl not a commentary on dichen lachmans performance but simply how her character was written although ill say she has some work to do before she receives any emmy nods it is through her character that the spanish europeans actions are justified her function in the film as the love interest of rios affirms that the european way is the right way simply because they are european there is really no other reason given its really just left to the assumption that the viewer is meant to associate themselves with the europeans over the aztec because their dress language ideology etc is more familiar to them than the aztec - so therefore the aztec are portrayed as adversarial and backwards and its not simply that the viewer is left with that assumption due to ethnocentric perception on the viewers part but it really seems like the story is trying to convince the viewer - as if the aztec were not capable of coming up with a plan - if not a better one - to lure a dinosaur to its death on a bed of punji sticksin fairness there is a subgroup of the spanish who are portrayed as looting temples and intent on simply abusing the native mesoamericans there is also a scene where we have the christian holy man noting the achievements of the aztec: they have agriculture medicine calendar etc - but in the end it is still the aztec warrior who is portrayed as the main antagonist of the movie even over the thunder lizards more on that later he his portrayed as treacherous duplicitous and attempts to dispatch the romantic european spaniard by tricking him into consuming hallucinogenic mind altering mushrooms - an important spiritual component to certain aspects and religions of the native meso & north americans again more on this later so that he can keep the female he feels belongs to him and away from the spaniard now in analyzing the true nature of the story leaving the obvious christian vs pagan themes off of the table from a symbolic standpoint - a viewer can easily take these so-called thunder lizards to be representatives of the mesoamerican ideologytheology which in this movie is portrayed as being one intent on: bloodthirstiness mercilessness cruelness wicked maybe even evil in opposition we have this group of christian wanderers led by a young hernando cortes who are portrayed as naive yet overall noble lambs caught up in the dark heathen world of the aztec also the name of the film is aztec rex leading one to believe that it is about dinosaurs out to eat people however what aztec rex translates to is aztec king a the head of the aztec state or in this instance state-of-being hence why the title of the film was changed and so who in fact do we see as the new aztec king at the end its the remaining spaniard rios aztec rex is in reference to the new european ideology which overcame through disease bloodshed war & famine native americans rios symbolizes the ideal european - as the presenters of this film would like them to be remembered in opposition to cortes who represents the practical-yet-still-noble european but when you examine the holocausts of the americas let us be honest: dont the symbolic components of this films story have it backwards i have to say aztec rex is at worst a little racist or to be kind about it ignorant at bestand yes i know its just a movie all meant to be in fun i understand but so at the end were left with the idea that rios was the father of the last remaining aztec lines i wonder what native mesoamericans would have to think about this ending as for myself i thought it was a little too self indulgentbest supporting performance of the movie goes to ian zierings wig - although conspicuous - it did at least alter zierings appearance enough so that i didnt think i was watching the yuppie from 90210 leading a bunch of conquistadors into the heart of darkness ziering actually proves himself to be a more-than-capable actor in this movie i actually bought his performance or at least i forgot it was ian ziering anyway i dont know whom his agent is but he should get more workin closing it was also a pleasure to see jim mcgee again ive been a fan ever since his all too brief scene-stealing performance in 1988s scroogedalexander quaresma -

ok where do we start with this little gem mutant slugs begin to take over a small new england town only one man can stop them and that man is mike brady! now if that wasnt laughable enough stay tunedthe footage of the slugs is whats known as stock footage no matter who the slugs attack or where they are the same shot of piles of slugs oozing everywhere is shown keep in mind this singular shot occupies at least half the moviethe acting in the movie was knock down drag out steal your wallet punch your girlfriend kill your dog bad im sure theres worse but youre going to be hard pressed to find it the only gem was you guessed it mike brady! he must have taken a few night classes at the ymca because he was the best in the bunchas for horror this film is not to be taken seriously there isnt horror! theyre slugs for crying out loud the entire rising action could have been avoided with a salt shaker or two only watch this film in a mst3k type environment otherwise i can see some major damage to the brain<SEP>0
awesomely improbable and foolish potboiler that at least has some redeeming crisp location photography but its too unbelievable to generate much in the way of tension i was kinda hoping that stanwyck wouldnt make it back in time because really she was saddled with the wet in more ways than one husbandand she had an idiot child as wellwhy not run off with meeker but the nagging question remainswhat sort of wood was that pier support made of if a rotten piece of it pulled off didnt float stanwyck always impeccably professional does the best she could with the material but its threadbare<SEP>0
no other movie has made me feel like this before and i dont feel bad like i dont want my money back or the time that i waited to watch this movie 9 months nor do i feel bad about using two hours of a sunny summer day in order to view this ______ the reason i say _____ is because no matter how hard i wrack my brain i just cant seem to come up with a word in any of the seven languages that movie was in to sum it up i have no idea what was going on the entire time and half way through the movie i needed a breather no movie has ever done this to me before never in my life have i wanted cauliflower milk and baguettes this much thank you - eduh *clears throat* no words no thoughts i dont know i truly dont know - cait<SEP>1
man i really wanted to like these shows i am starving for some good television and i applaud tnt for providing these opportunites but sadly i am in the minority i guess when it comes to the cinematic stephen king as brilliant as kings writing is the irony is that it simply doesnt translate well to the screen big or small with few exceptions very few the king experience cannot be filmed with the same impact that the stories have when read many people would disagree with this but im sure that in their heart of hearts they have to admit that the best filmed king story is but a pale memory of the one they read the reason is simple the average king story takes place in the mind-scape of the characters in the story he gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts their emotions and their sometimes fractured or unreal points of view in short king takes the reader places where you cant put a panavision camera as an audience watching the filmed king were left with less than half the information than the reader has access to its not too far a stretch to claim that one becomes a character in a king story they read whereas one is limited to petty voyeurism of that same character when filmed for as long as king writes hollywood will try shooting everything that comes out of his word processor without any regard to whether or not they should i dont blame the filmmakers for trying but it takes an incredible amount of talent and circumspection to pull off the elusive stephen king adaptation that works the task is akin to turning lead into gold or some arcane zen mastery oh well better luck next time<SEP>0

there is one really good scene in faat kine the title character gets in an argument with another woman and after being threatened faat kine sprays her in the face the scene works because the act is so unexpected bizarre and rather funny at the same time in that one instance writerdirector ousmane sembene gives the audience a character that is easy to root for an interesting film character that could be worth watching for two hours in the scene he presents a brave woman who is bold in her actions for the rest of the movie the only other thing he seems to present is conflicting tones the tone is all over the place its true not all movies have to clearly fit within a specific genre but i dont think faat kine fits into any genre supposedly its a drama though there are moments of such broad comedy the aforementioned spraying in the face that it cannot be taken seriously on the other hand the film is certainly not a comedy with the abundant amount of serious topics sembene has crammed into the picture there is a way to successfully mix comedy and drama together unfortunately semebene doesnt find that balance instead one scene after another just drift into each other without much rhyme or reason leaving two different tones hanging in the wind faat kine also has the problem of running two hours long with an extremely drawn out finale the film ends with a big party where all the characters conflicts are resolved only they arent resolved quickly the scene lasts longer than any other scene going on for probably twenty minutes because the rest of the scenes up until this point have been meandering the finale is particularly hard to endure with repetition beginning early on in the scene making for a frustrating viewing experienceperhaps i am being too hard on faat kine i am not the right audience for it i felt nothing towards the characters and had no connection to any part of the story there are people who will probably find something meaningful in the story and see strong characters however i was unable to do so and thus cannot recommend it<SEP>0
film starts in 1840 japan in which a man slashes his wife and her lover to death and the commits suicide its a very gory bloody sequence then it jumps to present daywell 1982 to be precise ted edward albert wife laura susan george and their annoying little kid move to japan for hubbys work they rent a house and--surprise! surprise--it just happens to be the house where the murders took place! the three dead people are around as ghosts the makeup is hysterically bad and make life hell for the familysounds ok--but its really hopeless theres a bloody opening and ending and nothing happens in between there is an attack by giant crabs which is just uproarious! they look so fake--i swear i saw the strings pulling one along--and theyre muttering!!!!! theres a pointless sex sequence in the first 20 minutes probably just to show off georges body another one about 40 minutes later but that was necessary to the plot and a really silly exorcism towards the end the fight scene between albert and doug mcclure must be seen to be believedas for acting--albert was ok as the husband and mcclure was pretty good as a family friend but george--as always--is terrific in a lousy film she gives this film a much needed lift--but cant save it im giving this a 2 just for her and the gory opening and closing that aside this is a very boring film<SEP>0
unless you understand wretched excess this movie wont really mean much to you an attempt was made to interject a bit of humanity into a cold and bleak period consumed by alcohol and drugs -- it doesnt workwhen salma hayak does her big disco number her voice is so obviously dubbed it is pathetic -- the producers could at least have gotten someone that sounded remotely like herthe documentary that has been playing on television lately is far superior and gives a much truer view of that period of our historyno one with the exception of mikey myers could be accused of acting; however he does an incredible job<SEP>0
running man viciously lampoons the modern-day american media complex and hits its target dead-center it may be an easy target but they pull it off none the less rm effortless takes on pro-wrestling featuring some pro wrestlers as the hunters network television the nielsen ratings the american government suggesting its entertainment-oriented anyway crime & punishment and a half-dozen other things along the way its a far cry from the original stephen king novella and arnold is not the ben richards of the novella either but who cares its basically a arnie flick with all the well-choreographed action sequences and one-liners such an undertaking requires<SEP>1
buster absolutely shines in this episode which is the only vehicle ive seen towards the end of the career that allowed him to do the physical and silent! comedy that made him famous its still a shock to hear his gravelly voice in the talkie sequences - his voice is about the only thing i dont care for as far as buster is concerned - but his ability to take a pratfall is still unparalleled he even repeats some of the gags used in his early two-reelers with roscoe arbucklemy deepest gratitude to rod serling for presenting us with this episode and for giving busters genius full scope he didnt have much time one episode to do it in but this is a touching tribute to hollywoods greatest genius<SEP>1
i thought that rotj was clearly the best out of the three star wars movies i find it surprising that rotj is considered the weakest installment in the trilogy by many who have voted to me it seemed like rotj was the best because it had the most profound plot the most suspense surprises most emotionalespecially the ending and definitely the most episodic movie i personally like the empire strikes back a lot also but i think it is slightly less good than than rotj since it was slower-moving was not as episodic and i just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as i did with the third movieit also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole i have heard many strange reasons such as: a because yoda died b because bobba fett died c because small ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d because darth vader was revealedi would like to debunk each of these reasons because i believe that they miss the point completely first off who cares if bobba fett died if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die dont get me wrong i am fan of bobba fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not lucas intention to make him a central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fetts name!!! judging rotj because a minor character died is a bit much i think secondly many fans did not like yoda dying sure it was a momentous period in the movie i was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic all the good guys cant stay alive in a realistic movie you know otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon another aspect to this point about people not liking yodas death well nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy why was obi wans death okay but yodas not hmmmmmmmmmmmm another reason i just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible that is utterly ridiculous!! i can not believe this one!! first off the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage since you lived in the forest all your life i hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage they had swinging vines ropes logs set up to trip those walkers and other traps the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest the only thing they had was their blasters to add it was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest i thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the star wars heros the band of rebels as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have been a great upset lastly if this scene was still unbelievable to you how about in empire strikes back or in a new hope where there were several scenes of a group consisting of just han solo chewbacca and the princess being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view!! and not only that the heroes of course always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters the troopers must have very very bad aim then! at least in empire strikes back the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers dont believe me check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping landos base or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at somehow they missedas han solo and luke were trying to exit the death starthe last reason that i care to discuss others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here is that people did not like darth vader being revealed! well in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father annakin skywalker it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his fathers face because it made it complete by annakins revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he was annakin skywalker by removing the helmet the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about in fact thats is what i would have done in that scene too if i were lukes fatherisnt that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmeton another note i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse even if it is better that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not get as many accolades as it deserves i never go into a film with that deception in mind i always try to go into a film with the attitude that well it might be better or worse that the original but i can not know for sure lets see that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really wasi am not sure who criticizes these movies but i have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me except for one person that said that a new hope was their favorite that it is rotj i believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleadingbottom line the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy this movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes there was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful exciting surprising or all of the above for example the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj was better than the one in the empire strikes back any day!!!finally i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky insignificant details or see it as just another sequel to trash the movie such as this movie stinks because luke is not in it! then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunately<SEP>1
when i was seventeen i genuinely believed elvis to be the king of rock and roll and not only did i wish to see all 31 of his character movies but it was my ambition to own them too what an exceptionally poor excuse for a seventeen-year-old i must have been thankfully sense prevailed and live a little love a little is the only elvis film i ownthe spotlight has fallen on this one recently since a remixed version of top song a little less conversation has been released as a single his first to reach the uk top ten in 22 years  his first uk no1 in 25 even when i was seventeen and in serious need of psychiatric help i realised that the songs for this movie werent exactly first rate however a little less conversation - rollnecks and 60s grooving aside - is a real standout finding a lesser-known song that only a relatively small few are aware of promoted into the mainstream produces a mixture of emotions its nice to finally see faith in a song vindicated but its also saddening to see the disintegration of your own private cult and what chauvinistic lyrics too though what other elvis song contains the word procrastinatebut what really bothers me about this film is not a little less conversation but the 84 minutes that surround it actually based on a novel kiss my firm but pliant lips - what kind of lame novel would that be this one sees a bored elvis holed up with a comedy dog and a nympho within 90 seconds of meeting him michele carey asks would you like to make love to me quite a fast mover by any standards im sure youll agreei do seem to recall that some of elviss early movies - most notably jailhouse rock and king creole - werent too bad but this is just identikit hillbilly cobblers being fired from a newspaper job can lead to a five minute karate fight with a couple of gingernuts causing a motorway pile up is good for a laugh and models dress as pink mermaids theres even a dream sequence for gods sake maybe the only dumb stereotype it doesnt conform to is in not having all that many songs with just four to choose from including the credits number youre waiting an average of 22 minutes between tracks some movies would become vapid by having too many tunes but here they might have helped to have numbed the pain of the remaining three tracks then the edge of reality isnt actually that bad though elviss dance to it must surely have been called the bear trapin one sense for a pg certificate film from 1968 then this is shockingly high on sexual content sadly however with talking dogs middle america sitcom values and the stiffest dancing youll ever see elviss dignity is obliterated by this movie<SEP>0

most who go to this movie will have an idea what it is about; a man loses his entire family and even his dog in a flight from boston that fateful morning of september 11 2001 what you probably wont know before seeing this film is this: how that would feel; what do you do with that; and how would that affect you and the way you relate to every waking day the story unfolds painfully slow from the gate and then warms up nicely as it gains a little speed while the recently renewed relationship between dentist alan johnson don cheadle and ex-college roommate charlie fineman adam sandler solidifies and begins to take shape characters appear in this film whose presence initially seem obligatory and not well developed but in fact stay with this story and you find that the simplicity of each character is what makes this story believable - and accurate real people inhabit a real situation whereby they can do little but stand aside while one amongst them disintegrates the pain inside charlies soul is subtly evident from first introduction and grows as we learn more about his character brilliantly revealed by sandler as layers of an onion  one layer at a time with lightness and weight combined its so subtle a performance that he sneaks up on you and gets inside your head while you are watching him on screen cheadles alan johnson is equally subtle and very don cheadle always watchable the ease thats apparent when cheadles on screen speaks to his consummate acting skills alans relationship with charlie fineman is delicate in texture just as the situation would demand fineman doesnt want friendship nor anybody intruding into his cloistered life and yet the likable quality that alan owns is simple and honest enough to intrigue even a recluse like charlie it is alan who has the task of gingerly opening up charlies carefully sealed life there is inherent danger in the process the more alan nudges charlie to open up going so far as engaging the services of friend and psychologist angela oakhurst liv tyler the nearer the danger of pushing charlie over the edge its an abyss that charlie teeters on each and every waking moment and one he has learned to navigate through sheer dint of denial he has denied everything that priorly existed for him in order to exist with his loss unfortunately his grief is one thing he cannot deny sandler withdraws so deeply into his characters pain during the storys unfolding that by the time he meets his demons head-on the viewer shares his pain almost equally alan stands beside charlie throughout this exacting process at the risk of lousing up his own perfect home-life - run with admirable grace and efficiency by wife janeane jada pinkett smith while tending to charlies recovery alan looks inward and recognizes his own silent screams at the death of the independence he once owned and the boy he has lost becoming a man his reward for helping charlie is helping himself reconnect with what he has lost the theme is much like the fisher king; another story of a man who isolates himself to the point of madness from sorrow and loss like the fisher king the story concludes with the traditional there is someone for everyone theme reign over mes lidia sinclair played by the wonderful amanda plummer in the fisher king is donna remar saffron burrows a woman on the verge of breakdown and sketchy patient of johnsons who turns out to be the just unstable enough to complement charlies borderline insanity its a good ending to the story but the one element probably least likely to ring true then again maybe there really is someone for everyone devorah macdonald vancouver bc<SEP>1
whoa boyever wanted to watch a documentary about a megalomaniacal jerk ruining his own life and alienating everyone around him well they exist in many forms but have you ever wanted to watch said documentary about one who didnt ultimately succeed in doing anything despite everyones praises about how much of an artistic genius he is well you could probably just grab a camera and find someone like that in any local scene i know theyre everywhere and i dont even follow the local scene or you could save yourself the trouble by spending money watching this tripethe premise is good and honestly its not as if the filmmakers knew precisely where it was going considering thats one of the difficulties of doing a documentary we are made to follow two bands the brian jamestown massacre lead by anton and the dandy warhols lead by courtney ive heard of the dandy warhols before watching this movie not so the brian jamestown massacre why well from this documentarys perspective because the brian jamestown massacres intergroup dysfunction refused them the ability to really make it in the music industry however instead of this becoming an analysis of the two separate bands and how one was able to succeed the focus becomes much more on anton and his insanitybecause see anton is a genius because he plays rock music he really understands the evolution of music because he plays rock music with a lot of different instruments his music is considered post-modern retro but the future because its rock music he wants to bring out a revolution through rock music okay so lets face it twenty minutes in and this is one of the stupidest kids id care to watch a documentary aboutthe documentary itself doesnt really lend itself to showcasing any of antons talent because in the nature of editing down 2000 hours of material into a quarter short of two hours we dont really have the time to focus on that so instead we watch anton the genius the socio-maniacal loser be a jerk for the two hours and are just told to understand that he made really great music whether he did or not i wont know because its not like the documentary had enough time to prove it what i do know is that then were left with a story about some self-centered obnoxious twerp running around the country calling himself a god of music and doing nothing to back it up why even bother watching that people like anton dont deserve the attention they seek the hope and admiration of all those different people and especially a post-failure paean to lost potential this movie plays like a two-hour rough-cut vh1 special for a reason: he goes on and on about the music but its all about the image and the attention look at the guy look at how he dresses look at how he acts look at how he tries to create controversy because he cant afford marketinghonestly the only interesting character in this film is joel and thats because of anyone in this documentary joel is the only person who seems to have any fun maybe its because hes the tambourine man the rest of them are all rock stars! they deserve our attention and admiration and interest and engagements! they are out there to save rock and roll do you remember when the white stripes were supposed to save rock and roll yeah that was because of anton and its selfish of them not to mention me anton as an inspiration what a load people like anton are best left forgotten this documentary explains why mainstream music is so dull--because music execs have to deal with people like anton for a living and ultimately can only really throw their support behind someone safe and passionless thanks a lot anton your antics ruined music for everyone you touched whatever the opinion to the contrary is and if people in the know about anton disagree and he really was a genius it still shows how bad this documentary is that it cuts it down that way--polarisdib<SEP>0

admittedly i find al pacino to be a guilty pleasure he was a fine actor until scent of a woman where he apparently overdosed on himself irreparably i hoped this film of which id heard almost nothing growing up would be a nice little gem an overlooked ahead-of-its-time intelligent and engaging city-political thriller its notcity hall is a movie that clouds its plot with so many characters names and realistic citywide issues that for a while you think its a plot in scope so broad and implicating that once you find out the truth it will blow your mind in truth however these subplots and digressions result ultimately in fairly tame and very familiar urban story trademarks such as corruption of power two-faced politicians mafia with police ties etc and theoretically this setup allows for some thrilling tension the fear that none of the characters are safe and anything could happen! but again it really doesntunfortunately the only things that happen are quite predictable and were left with several confession monologues that are meant as a whole to form modern a fable of sorts a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the real world of politics and society but after 110 minutes of names and missing reports and a spider-web of lies and cover-ups the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfying reveal i dont think were left with that in city hall and while its a very full film i dont find it altogether rich<SEP>0
i dont know anything of the writers or the directors earlier work so i hadnt brought any prejudices to the film based on the brief description of the plot in tv guide i thought it might be interestingbut implausibility was piled upon implausibility each turn of the plot seemed to be an excuse to drag in more bloodshed gruesome makeup or special effectsthe score was professional and kari wuhrer seems like a decent actress but the rest was more than disappointing it was positively repulsivei will not go through the vagaries of the narrative but ill give an example of what i think of as an excess of explicit gorechris mckenna goes to an isolated ranch house and pulls the frozen body of his earlier victim wendt out of the deep freeze mckenna had killed wendt by biting a chunk out of his neck now he feels he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in wendts demise what are the cops going to do measure his bite radius mckenna unwraps wendts head and neck from the freezer bag its in takes an ax and begins to chop off wendts head whack whack whack the bit of the ax keeps chipping away at wendts neck the air is filled with nuggets of flying frozen flesh one of which drops on mckennas head he brushes it off when hes done mckenna then takes the frozen head outside to a small fire hes built he sits the head on the ground squats next to it takes out some photos of a woman hes just killed and shows them to wendts head remember her we could have really made it if it hadnt been for you guys he tells the head duke youve always liked bonfires havent you he asks then he places the head on the fire we only get a glimpse of it burning but we can hear the fat sizzling in the flamei dont want this sort of garbage to be censored im only wondering who enjoys seeing this stufftheres no reason to go on with the rest of the movie well ill mention one example of an implausibility since i brought the idea up mckenna has been kidnapped and locked in a dark bare shack he knows hes going to be clobbered half to death in the following days hes literally invited the heavies to do it what would you do in this poe-like situation heres what mckenna does on what may turn out to be the last night of his life he finds a discarded calendar with a pin-up girl on it and masturbates successfully give that man the medal of freedom! a monster who looks like pizza the hut is thrown into some unnecessary flashbacks the camera is often hand held and wobbly the dialog has lines like life is a piece of s*** or else its the best of all possible worlds it depends on your point of view use is made of a wide angle lens that turns ordinary faces into gargoyle masks a house blows up in an explosive fireball at the end while the hero mckenna walks towards us in the foregroundsome hero he is too he first kills a man for $13000 by bashing him over the head several times with a heavy statue then a potted plant before finally tipping a refrigerator over onto the body this bothers him a little but not enough to keep him from insisting on payment then i hope i have the order straight he kills wendt by ripping out part of his neck then he kills the wife of his first victim by accident and blames the heavies for it although by almost any moral calculus they had nothing to do with it next he burns the head honcho baldwin alive then having disabled the two lesser heavies he deliberately blows them up though one of them isnt entirely unsympathetic and were supposed to be rooting for mckennathese arent cartoon deaths like those in the dirty harry movies either -- bang bang and youre dead these are slow and painful the first one -- the murder for $13000 -- is done clumsily enough to resemble what might happen in real life it isnt really easy to kill another human being as hitchcock had demonstrated in torn curtain but that scene leads to no place of any importancesome people might enjoy this especially those young enough to think that pain and death are things that happen only in movies some meretricious stuff on screen here<SEP>0
the viewer leaves wondering why he bothered to watch this one or why for that matter anyone bothered to make it there is no plot - just random scenes of ridiculous action mia saras shower scene appeals to the male libido but thats not much reason to make a movie<SEP>0
nothing in this movie is funny i thought the premise giving a human the libido of a randy ram was interesting and should provide for some laughs wrong! there is simply nothing funny about the movie for example the main character making a pass at a goat in heat in the middle of a farmers yard is not funny it borders on obscenity they are toying around with bestiality in this film on one level and it just aint funnywe all know that dogs will eat anything anywhere anytime the main character doing this with everything everywhere everytime is also not funny it becomes a clicherob schneider is i guess acceptable in the role by this i mean that hes not a bad actor but with rotten material its difficult to comment on quality however coleen haskell the other half of the human-romantic leads does one count the number of animals that the main character has interest in as romantic leads too seems embarrassed by the whole thing as well she should be she seems to be acting in some kind of vacuum detached from all the other actors in the movie see this film only if you wish to be bored by tasteless dull repetitive material<SEP>0
spoilers many different comedy series nowadays have at one point or another experimented with the idea of obscure independence in an early episode of cartoon family guy the griffin family find their home is an independent nation to the united states of america and the story progresses from there way back in 1949 however the ealing studios produced a wonderful little film along the same ideaafter a childs prank the residents of pimlico discover a small fortune in treasure at the inquest it becomes clear that the small area is a small outcrop of the long lost state of burgundy withdrawing from london and the rest of great britain the residents of the small street experience the joys and the problems with being an independent statebased at a time when rationing was still in operation this story is brilliantly told and equally inspiring featuring performances by stanley holloway betty warren philip stainton and a young charles hawtrey the film is well stocked with some of the finest actors of their generation these actors are well aided as well by a superb little script with some cracking lines feeling remarkably fresh despite being over 50 years old the story never feels awkward and always keeps the audience entertainedealing studios was one of the finest exporters of british film ever in existence with films like passport to pimlico its not difficult to see why amusing from start to finish the story is always fun and always worth watching<SEP>1
certainly nomad has some of the best horse riding scenes swordplay and scrumptious landscape cinematography youll likely see but this isnt what makes a film good it helps but the story has to shine through on top of these things and thats where nomad wandersthe story is stilted giving it a sense that it was thrown together simply to make a cool movie that looks great not to mention that many of the main characters are not from the region in which this story takes place and its blatantly obvious with names like lee and hernandez if movie makers want to engross us in a culture like the jugars and the kazaks they damn well better use actorsactresses that look the partwarring tribes a prophecy brotherly love and respect a love interest that separates our heroes are all touched on but with so little impact and screen time that most viewers will brush them aside in favor of the next battle sequence the next action horse scene or the breathtaking beauty of the landscapeit is worth mentioning that there were some significant changes made to nomad during its filming specifically the director and cinematographer ivan passer director was replaced by sergei bodrov and ueli steiger cinematographer was replaced by dan laustsen in one respect laustsen seems to have the better eye since his visions of the lands made the final cut that we see here definitely a good thing however the changing over to bodrov as director may not have been the wisest choice from what im seeing here the focus is on the battles and not the people which i sense comes from bodrovs eyes and not passers a true travestythe most shameful aspect is that this couldve been a really fantastic film with both character and action focuses unfortunately the higher-ups apparently decided that action was what was needed and took the cheap intellectually speaking way outeven though i cant give this film a positive rating it is worth watching simply for the amazing cinematography work but thats all<SEP>0

finally a thriller which omits the car chases explosions and other eye catching effects the movie combines a simple plot assasination of a french president with an excellent background it takes a look behind mans behavior with authorities and explains why we would obey almost every order even murder which would be given to usfurthermore it shows us how secret services can manipulate the run of history and how hardly they can be controlled the best thing on this movie is that there is no classic hollywood end which can easily be predicted<SEP>1
go immediately and rent this movie it will be be on a bottom shelf in your local video store and will be covered in dust no one will have touched it in years it may even be a $50 special! its worth ten bucks i swear! buy it! there arent very many films than can compare with this - the celluloid version of that goo that forms at the bottom of a trash can after a few years yes i gave it a 1 but it really deserves much lower 1-10 scales were not designed with stuff like this in mind<SEP>0
an interesting tv movie based on true fact betrayed by the description of one of the leading characters that of a prisoner giovanni ribisi plays his younger brother who has the delicate mission of deciding if he will appeal to the courts for his brothers death penalty but when he goes to visit him and enters elias koteas the problem starts it has nothing to do with koteas acting ability he just looks like the version of a prisoner of proletarian roots according to gq magazine with a language too sophisticated for someone who has spent most of his life behind bars this realization came to me after meeting again an old friend whom i had not seen for almost 15 years which he spent in several panamanian jails the young man i used to know is gone not only because he is older but due to his exposure for a prolonged time to the penal system there are jails and there are jails one must say but this one prisoner in shot in the heart is definitely out of this world<SEP>1

documentary about nomadic persians making a treacherous traverse of massive mountains to get their herds to grass watching this silent black and white feature marred in part by a twink-twink-twink oriental music score that could not have been used in the original exhibition is even duller than it sounds the spectacular scenery is lost on a small black and white screen and there is an utter failure to establish any kind of plot line i loved nanook of the north and march of the penguins but despised this movie notwithstanding the similarity of the theme physical hardships alone are just not that interesting<SEP>0
this movie is still an all time favorite only a pretentious humorless moron would not enjoy this wonderful film this movie feels like a slice of warm apple pie topped with french vanilla ice cream! i think this is chers best work ever and her most believable performance cher has always been blessed with charisma good looks and an enviably thin figure whether you like her singing or not - who else sounds like cher cher has definitely made her mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others have come and gone she is one of the most unique artists out there its funny because who would have thought of cher as such a naturally gifted actress she is heads above the so-called movie stars of today cher is a real actor on the same level as debra winger alfre woodard holly hunter angela bassett and a few others in that she never seems to be acting she really becomes the character convincingly she has more than earned the respect of her peers and of the movie-going publiceverything about moonstruck is wonderful - the characters the scenery the dialog the food i never get tired of watching this movieevery time single time i watch the scene where they are all sitting around the dinner table at roses house i pause the remote to see exactly what delicious food rose is serving i saw the spaghetti mushrooms i think but i cant make out whether they are eating ravioli ziti what is that main course it looks wonderful and its driving me nuts! everybody in that family was a hardworking individual and they respected and cared about one another the grandfather wasnt pushed aside and tolerated he was a vital part of the family and he was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom he seemed to be a pretty healthy independent old codger toolorettas mom wasnt just a housewife she was the glue that held the family together and was a model example of what a wife mother and home manager should aspire to be she was proud of the lifestyle she had chosen but she didnt let it define who she was high powered businessmen arent as comfortable in their skin as rose casterini was notice the saucy way she said i didnt have kids until after i was 37 it aint over til its over you got the sense that she had been the type of young woman who did exactly as she pleased and got her way without the other person realizing what had happened she was charming quick witted and very smart what a great mom! i didnt actually like loretta right away because she seemed like a bit of a know--it-all who wasnt really as adventurous and as in control of herself as she wanted others to think she could tell others about themselves and where they had gone wrong but she really didnt apply common sense to her own life she was going to marry a middle-aged mamas boy simply because she wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose to her life she was more conventional than her own mom she dressed and wore her hair like a matron at a house of detention and seemed humorless and bored but underneath you sensed that she was vulnerable and lonely and had a lot of love to give the right man she would probably end up making an awesome mom tooi could see in the future a house full of loretta and ronnies loud screaming happy kids and rose and cosmo enjoying every minute of it<SEP>1
i have grown up pouring over the intertwined stories of the wrinkle in time chronicles my dream was that one day a screenwriter would come across their child sitting in a large sofa reading a winkle in time and would think what an amazing movie this would make sadly enough that screenwriter failed changing characters throwing in lame humor and all out destroying the plot i know that it is a hard task to change a well loved novel into a movie but why cant you stay true to the book why must you change the way characters think and act for those of you who have not read the book pick it up find a soft couch and let your imagination run wild<SEP>0
if this documentary had not been made by the famous french director louis malle i probably would have turned it off after the first 15 minutes as it was an incredibly dull look at a very ordinary midwestern american town in 1979 this is not exactly my idea of a fun topic and the film footage closely resembled a collection of home movies considering i didnt know any of these people it was even less interestingbecause it was a rather dull slice of life style documentary i wondered while watching what was the message they were trying to convey perhaps it was that values arent as conservative as you might think--this was an underlying message through many of the vignettes such as the republicans whose son was a draft resister as well as the man and lady who thought sex outside of marriage was just fine or perhaps the meaning was that there was a lot of bigotry underlying the nice home town--as several ugly ideas such as blaming jews for financial conspiracies anti-black bigotry and homophobia all were briefly exploredthe small town of 1979 was explored in great depth and an idyllic sort of world was portrayed but when the film makers returned six years later the mood was depressed thanks to president reagan this seemed very disingenuous for several reasons first the 1979 portion was almost 90% of the film and the final 10% only consisted of a few interviews of people that blamed the president for just about everything but acne what about the rest of the folks of this town did they all see reagan as evil or that their lives had become more negative with only a few updates it seemed suspicious second while it is true that the national debt doubled in the intervening years so did the gross national product and while malle shows 1979 as a very optimistic period it was far from that as the period from 1974-1980 featured many shortages gas sugar etc strikes high inflation and general malaise while i am not a huge fan of reagan because government growth did not slow during his administration the country in general was far more optimistic than it had been in the ford and carter years while many in the media demonized reagan a popular sport in the 80s the economy improved significantly and the documentary seems very one-sided and agenda driven had the documentary given a more thorough coverage of 1985 and hadnt seemed too negative to be believed after all everyone didnt have their lives get worse--this defies common sense then i might have thought otherwiseoverall not the wonderful documentary some have proclaimed it to be--ranging from a dull film in 1979 to an extremely slanted look at 1985by the way is it just me or does the film drop dead gorgeous seem to have been inspired at least in part by this film both are set in similar communities but the latter film was a hilarious mockumentary without all the serious undertones<SEP>0
ok so the oscars seem to get hyped just a little more each year and i was rooting for gosford park to win come on robert altman had deserved an oscar for years! that said i guess that it was high time for an african-american to win best actress contrary to the previous reviewer halle berrys role in monsters ball was far more original than nicole kidmans in moulin rouge; i never would have thought to nominate the latter for anything especially in a year that saw mulholland dramong the things that i had predicted was the stuff about the september 11 attacks; i knew that they were going to say something about freedom yeah yeah robert redford should know better but contrary again to the previous reviewer whoopi goldberg is not the worst host among the past hosts was bob hope for whom i have no respect; i really liked her jab at john ashcroftso although i wouldnt have given a beautiful mind best picture the 74th annual academy awards still pleased me i have to admit i enjoy the oscars more than my own birthday and the day after as my parents and i were hiking around the dwellings in bandalier new mexico - it was spring break - i was thinking to myself that when jim broadbent won his oscar that most people watching were asking jim who! i wonder whether or not woody allen will ever attend the oscars again<SEP>1
forbidden planet is one of the best examples of hollywood sf films its influence was felt for more than a decade however certain elements relating to how this wide-screen entertainment was aimed at a mid-fifties audience that is now gone have dated it quite a bit and the films sometimes sluggish pacing doesnt help but the storys compelling central idea involving the ancientextinct krell civilization and monsters from the id hasnt lost its appeal and continue to make this film a relevant must see movie what im mostly interested in saying here is that the current dvd for this movie is terrible the movie has never really looked that good on home video and its elements are in dire need of restoration i hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this sf classic<SEP>1
i didnt feel that this film was quite as clever as it seemed to think it was but enjoyed it nevertheless it is original although reminded me a little of two other french films vidocq and city of lost children mostly for the colouring but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the charactersset in a prison cell but do not let this put you off this film seemingly goes further than many a multi locationed blockbusteralways interesting with the perennial black arts well to the fore and very good characterisation making some only too believable! scary with some gore this is well worth a viewing<SEP>1
this is the first 10 out of 10 that ive given any movie what made this movie so good for me constant action - there isnt any slow parts great acting smart writing i also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene finally i get to see an action movie that doesnt try to please all sectors of the public ie theres no forced romancei liked the first two bourne movies but i loved this onewarning - after watching this movie you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car!<SEP>1
this film is a joke and quinton should be ashamed of himself trying to pass this off as a modesty blaise film if you are having trouble sleeping then all means rent this film the stick figure they call a actress who is suppose to be modesty blaise has got to be the most boring person on this planet maybe she could be used as a hat stand in the back ground of a real filmseventy-five minutes of nothing thank you who ever invented the fast forward button if you see this film if you can call it that coming your way run i cant help but think what 3rd world country could of used the money wasted of this crap this film is boring the actors are boring waste of colour a waste air they breath if you would like to see mostey blaise film then watch the one they made in the 60s maybe that what the director should of done<SEP>0
believe me i like horror movies i like science fiction movies i like independent films and i like low-budget b movies sometimes i even like bad acting plodding scripts wooden lines improbably situations and the like however i did not like christmas on mars it just doesnt work on so many levels for all the reasons listed previously and many more that includes the nonsensical blatant use of images of female genitalia and the many allusions to male genitalia in a very freudian wayi am convinced this is purely from ineptitude as opposed to some attempt at doing something really different i mean any movie that takes years to film just cannot keep up the level of congruity and focus demanded by modern audiencesi had hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination by the main character however sadly it was meant to have happened as we saw things unfold on screen about the only kindness that i can express is that the image at the end was stupendous if this had been used at the beginning instead of the end it could have allowed the film to take off where 2001 ended to bad they didnt try that instead i just dont understand what was so important about this film that it even had to be made was it the plot surely it couldnt be was it the characters i doubt it; i mean i could live without knowing about ed 15 was it the dialog emphatically no the music perhaps but more-likely the unvarnished ego of the principals needing to be stroked much better efforts have died on the cutting room floor<SEP>0
a large part of the scenes should be cut off there is a lot of scenes that should have been cut off for example the scene where the hunters mentions i got spiders on my dick i like dick playing in the mud scene or a bar scene where a professional dinocroc hunters main job is a snake charmerhow about other terribly incoherent scenes featuring a woman diane who wants to loose her virginity to a boyfriend who walks like he wears womens panties three sizes too small while they make love didnt they realized they are making it out next to the little boy who will soon run away and loose his head why did they do in a living room i mean his head really flipped how about the beach scene very reminiscent of steven spielbergs jaws scene at grant lake all these strange scene could easily be re-dubbed and billed as a comedyhere in my local town the cineplex theaters had been advertising for months about dinocroc and i am glad i didnt watch it because i later found out it was shown only for 1 or 2 days before it was canceled the movie was that bad i suspected that dinocroc was not a good movie looking at the preview it features the leg of dinocroc that looks like a child wearing green pajamas and slippers with claws and walks up and down like a 2 year old it could easily passed over as baby geniusesif any students of movie making wants to learn what not to do this is a real classic trash such as dianes boyfriend who walks like he had an advanced case of syphilis makes you wonder what the poor woman sees in this guy who looks drunk even before he get to drink beer when this happens who cares about dinocroc the panties man looked more more interesting than the entire movie of dinocroc his acting was so bad he makes a much better replacement for mr bean move over rowan atkinson here is a man with a better comedic talent in a horror sci-fi flick perhaps the worse casting in the history of hollywood<SEP>0
i was very moved by the story and because i am going through something similar with my own parents i really connected it is so easy to forget that someone whose body is failing was once vibrant and passionate and then theres the mistakes they made and have to live with i loved ellen burstyns performance and who is christine horne shes fantastic! a real find there is probably the most erotic scene ive ever seen in a film yet nothing was shown - it was just so beautifully done overall the look and feel of the film was stunning a real emotional journey cole hauser is very very good in this picture he humanizes a man spiraling downwards i liked the way the filmmaker approached this womans life never sentimental never too much - just enough to hook us in but not enough to bog down<SEP>1
purple rain has never been a critics darling but it is a cult classic - and deserves to be if you are a prince fan this is for youthe main plot is prince seeing his abusive parents in himself and him falling in love with a girl believe it or not this movie isnt just singing and dancing there are many intense scenes and it is heartwarming sometimes it comes off has funny but when it works it really works very hit and missno one can really act in the film everyone is from one of princes side acts like the time and vanity 6 still it adds charm to the movie when ever prince is on screen he lights it up and it fun to see him at his commercial peak in conclusion go and see this if you love prince like me if you arent a fan itll make you one<SEP>1
lets put it this way i actually get this movie i get what the writerdirecter was trying to do i understand that the dialog was meant to be dry and emotionless i understand that the plot was supposed to be non-climactic and stale that was what the writerdirector was going for a very very very dry humorcomedy with all that understanding i still think the movie sucked it seemed like the writerdirector was trying to recreate napolean dynamite with this movie it had all of the same features even the main character behaved similar to napolean but napolean dynamite was actually funny its script worked this movie is not it has no purpose well let me rephrase that its only purpose is to rip off napolean dynamite and try to capture that look and feel too bad it didnt work<SEP>0
i am dumbfounded that i actually sat and watched this i love independent films horror films and the whole zombie thing in general but when you add ningas youve crossed a line that should never be crossed i hope the people in this movie had a great time making it then at least it wasnt a total waste youd never know by watching it though script are you kidding acting i think even the trees were faking cinematography well there mustve been a camera there period i dont think there was any actual planning involved in the making of this movie such a total waste of time that i wont prolong it by commenting further<SEP>0
the final film for ernst lubitsch completed by otto preminger after lubitschs untimely death during production is a juggling act of sophistication and silliness romance and music fantasy and costume dramatics in a 19th century castle in southeastern europe a countess falls for her sworn enemy the leader of the hungarian revolt; shes aided by her ancestor whose painted image magically comes to life betty grable in a long blonde wig adorned with flowers has never been more beautiful and her songs are very pleasant unfortunately this script by samson raphaelson taken from an operetta by rudolf schanzer and e welisch is awash with different ideas that fail to mesh--or entertain the results are good-looking but unabsorbing *12 from ****<SEP>0
this film has a lot of strong points it has one of the best horror casts outside of the lugosi-karloff-chaney circle: lionel atwill fay wray and dwight frye plus leading man melvyn douglas its got all the right ingredients: bats a castle with lots of stone staircases a mad scientist townspeople waving torches and hunting vampires an igor-type character a beautiful girl even a goofy-haired burgomeister the soft-focus camera work is moody and imaginative theres even some good comic relief nicely spaced throughout the scriptbut its not really a monster movie because there is nothing supernatural going on in kleinschloss little castle the plot revolves around the generic crazy scientist nicely played by atwill who values his work more highly than human livesits not top-tier material because of a ho-hum resolution of the plot and some embarrassingly bad dialog for dwight frye but its worth a look if you like early bw horror pictures<SEP>1
just two commentsseven years apart hardly evidence of the films relentless pulling-power! as has been mentioned the low-budget telemovie status of 13 gantry row is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal having said that however the thing is not without merit - either as entertainment or as a fright outing per setrue the plot at its most basic is a re-working of the amityville horror - only without much horror more a case of intrigue! gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played halifax -investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the house as the main suspect the script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard it just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key momentshaving picked the dvd up for a mere $395 last week at my regular video store i cannot begrudge the expenditure $1095 would be an acceptable price for the film just dont expect fireworks!<SEP>1
i have seen this film only the one time about 25 years ago and to this day i have always told people it is probably the best film i have ever seen considering there was no verbal dialogue and only thought dialogue i found the film to be enthralling and i even found myself holding my breath so as not to make any sound i would highly recomend this film i wish it was available on dvd<SEP>1
after a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted urban turn of the century australian street we meet julie rebecca gibney and peter john adam as they go out house hunting they manage to get a loan for a fixer-upper on a posh sydney street but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home it just may be haunted13 gantry row combines a memorable if somewhat clichéd story with good to average direction by catherine millar into a slightly above average shockerthe biggest flaws seem partially due to budget but not wholly excusable to that hurdle a crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film the opening thriller scene features some wonky editing freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that theres not much action suspense should be created from staging not fancy fix it in the mix techniques there is great atmosphere in the scene from the location the lighting the fog and such but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street showing their increasing proximity the tracking and the cuts need to be slow the attack needed to be longer clearer and better blocked as it stands the scene has a strong made for television feel and a low budget one at thatafter this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves the story has a lot of similarities to the amityville horror 1979 though the budget forces a much subtler approach millar and scriptwriter tony morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios often dramatic in nature instead of special effects-oriented such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wallfor some horror fans the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama at least the first half hour of the film is primarily about julie and peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in but morphett writes fine intelligent dialogue the material is done well enough that its often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later--especially if youve gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own houseonce they get settled and things begin to get weirder even though the special effects often leave much to be desired the ideas are good the performances help create tension there isnt an abundance of death and destruction in the film--theres more of an abundance of home repair nightmares but neither menace is really the pointthe point is human relationships there are a number of character arcs that are very interesting the house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it that its in a posh neighborhood and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe such as money or health problems peters character evolves from a striving corporate employee with normal work-based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful at the same time we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationshipalthough 13 gantry row never quite transcends its made-for-television clunkiness as a tv movie this is a pretty good one with admirable ambitions anyone fond of haunted house films psycho films or horrorthrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy it certainly isnt worth spending $30 for a dvd that was the price my local pbs station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it factoring in shipping and handling but its worth a rental and its definitely worth watching for free<SEP>1
near the closing stages of baby mama one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it was all just a mess; i really couldnt say it any better than that and while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyones time a lacklustre cast mundane script and vague caricature characters ensure that baby mama certainly isnt taxing on the ol noggin but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour consisting mainly of very routine cliché jokes based around an odd couple rich and poor trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographicas a story on finding love its not that bad but playing this plot line as a side-story of sorts to work alongside the comedy-orientated odd couple tangent characterisation is notably weak resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles as characters themselves both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness; so while we may eventually come to find the characters interactions with each other amusing at times the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles; we dont feel for the characters and dont find them inherently interesting but rather their dynamic unfortunately however although this dynamic works best or at least better than the individual personas as mentioned above it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the odd-couple formulakate tina fey is a successful business woman who has hired working class dumb-blonde angie amy poehler to be her unlikely surrogate and after angie decides to leave hopeless husband carl dax shepard both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences yes its the typical odd-couple premise and one that we have already seen in this years what happens in vegas yet what baby mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi-layered characters kate and angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air in fact the movies only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of romany malco who gets lumbered with playing a door-man of the few times that i laughed during baby mama most of those moments were because of this man and the remainder usually fell to shepardits a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its scripts themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera and yet director michael mccullers goes from page to screen effectively enough yet for a film about babies multi-million dollar business and cultural stereotyping this isnt necessarily a good thing baby mama is grade-a hammy plastic tinsel-town with capital bore topped with sugar so not only did i feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two-dimensional nature but i simply didnt care for the world they inhabited the dialogue along with sets costumes and the scripts general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the directors incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy; these arent characters and that isnt our world in any way so why should i care at the end of the day however a romantic comedys ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests and the frequency of its laughs; baby mama has little going on in any of these departments of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair im sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored in this respect baby mama avoids being unbearable but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience; a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch baby mama is too light-headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining- a review by jamie robert ward http:wwwinvocusnet<SEP>0
depardieus most notorious film is this 1974groundbreaker from bertrand blier it features many highly sexual scenes verging on an x-rating including one of jeanne moreau doing a hot 1970s version of her jules and jim menage a trois with the two hairy french hippies depardieu and deware there is no such thing as a sacred territory in this film; everything is fair gameits very odd that americans tend to not like this film very much while many french people ive met consider it a classic something about it goes against what americans have been programmed to likegerard and the late patrick deware are two bitch-slapping hippy drifters with many sexual insecurities going around molesting women and committing petty crimes theyre out for kicks and anti-capitalist euro-commie slacker freedom blier satirizes the hell out of these two guys while at the same time making bourgeois society itself look ultimately much more ridiculous best of all though is the way the wonderful stephane grappelli score conveys the restless soul of the drifters the deeper subconscious awareness or higher ideal that motivates all the follies they engage in<SEP>1
this movie is trash-poor it has horrible taste and is pedestrian and unconvincing in script although supposedly based on real-events - which doesnt add much of anything but make it more of a disappointment direction is not well done at as scenes and dialogue are out-of-place not sure what robin williams saw in this character or story to start williams is not convincing as a gay in a relationship breakup nor is the relationship itself interesting whats worse his character is compelled by an ugly pedophile story that is base and has no place as a plot device you have an older rory culkin tastelessly spouting d_ck_smker - in good fun- which is annoying enough and then laughed up by the williams character finally you have sandra oh as a guardian angel adviser to williams and a thrown in explanation of the whole fiasco towards the end toni colletes character is just plain annoying and a re-hash of her 6th sense performance with poorer direction very miss-able<SEP>0
good sequel to murder in a small town in this one cash and his police lt buddy unravel a sticky plot involving a nazi criminal a philanthropic witch and a family of screw-ups and their wierdo helpers as in the original the viewer is treated to a nice little mystery with distinctive sights and sounds of pre-war america go see it<SEP>1
pathetic this is what happens when director comes to work just because someone is paying him to the intentions were good great locations and settings for a film of epic proportions but the performance damn! i swear in some shots you can see extras on the background staring in the camera or looking at the actors because no one told them what they should do when they hear action! the battle scenes are so bad you wonder - are these people for real they couldve done more damage just by hugging each other in the slow-mo scenes you can see people on battle field walking around or just standing waving their hands only action in the foreground is somehow emphasized but for what the story is so illogical and discontinuous it seems like random situations in chronological order sometimes not even that the dialogs are dumb the love plot is more embarrassing and ridiculous than in hong kong action movies with a budget of 40 million and you can see every dollar invested on the screen in best case scenario the final result of all this enormous effort is a shiny round laser disk in the thin cover placed on the shelf in video store<SEP>0
using buster keaton in the twilight of his career was an interesting choice he may have been the most talented comedian of the silent age this gives him a chance to display those talents in a little time travel story he get hooked up with a guy living in modern times and it becomes obvious that we are best left in our own times keaton is able to do his sight gags very well ive heard his voice before i believe he did some of those beach party films playing some vacuous characters just to earn a few bucks serling seemed to have respect for him and portrayed him that way its not a bad story it shows how one reacts when we wish for something we dont have and get that wish<SEP>1
i have watched quite a few cold case episodes over the years beginning with season 1 episodes back in 2003-2004 and while most have been good this particular episode was not only the best of the best but has few rivals in the emmy categories though some may not agree with the story content ie the male-to-male romantic relationship i doubt that anyone could watch this without being deeply moved within their spiritthe story is essentially about a case that was reopened based on the testimony from a dying drug dealer the two central actors are two police officers in the 1960s named sean coop aka the cold case victim who goes by his last name coop and his partner jimmy bruno in the story coop is single a vietnam war vet with a deeply troubled past jimmy however is married with children no less both are partners on the police force and form not only a friendship but a secret romantic relationship that they both must hide from a deeply and obviously homophobic culture prevalent at that timethe flashback scenes of their lives are mostly in black and white with bits of color now and then sprinkled throughout examples include their red squad car the yellow curtains gently blowing by the window in jimmys bedroom where jimmys wife watched coop and jimmy drink fight and then kiss each other while being in an alcohol-induced state i found it interesting that only selected items were colored in the flashback scenes with everything else in black and white i still have not figured out the color scheme and rationalethe clearly homophobic tension between fellow patrol officers and the two central actors only heightens the intensity of the episode one key emotional scene was when coop was confronted by his father after the baptism of jimmys baby in this scene coops father sarge who was a respected fellow officer on the force confronts coop about the rumors surrounding coops relationship with jimmy one can feel sorry for coop at this point as the shame and disgrace of coops father was heaped upon coop - you are not going to disgrace our familyand youre not my son either - clearly indicative of the hostile views of same-sex relationships of that eraadditional tension can also be seen in the police locker room where coop and another officer go at it after coop and jimmy are labeled batman and robin homos as for the relationship between coop and jimmy its obvious that coop wanted more of jimmy in his life once can see the tension in jimmys face as he must choose between his commitment to his wife and kids his church and yet his undying devotion to coopin the end jimmy walks away from coop realizing that he cannot have both coop and his family at the same time sadly coop is killed perhaps because of his relationship with jimmy but coop may also have been killed for his knowledge of drug money and police corruption that reached higher up in the forcethe most moving scene in the whole episode was when coop as he sat dying from gunshot wounds in his squad car quietly spoke his last words over his police radio to his partner: jimmywe were the lucky ones dont forget thatthe soundtrack selection was outstanding throughout the episode i enjoyed the final scene with the actor chad everett playing the still grieving jimmy only much older by now and clearly still missing his former partner coopi highly recommend this episode and consider it the best it is without a doubt the most well-written well-acted and well done of all cold case episodes that ive ever seen<SEP>1
not one of your harder-hitting stories and thats a real strength of this film there are at least two relationships in which less confident writers would have added some all-too predictable romantic tension they not only spare the audience this but throw in some surprises at the same time there are a few disney-ish moments particularly near the end but they are manageable overall it was worth the rental and it was good relaxed funbtw if you get the dvd watch the segment where the director teaches you how to make aloo gobi we followed her directions and it was brilliant! next time we will make it the day before we plan to eat it because this is one dish that definitely gets better with a full night in the fridge to let the spices out!<SEP>1
i was intrigued by the title so during a small bout of insomnia fueled by my curiosity i stayed up and watched it i then checked my tv listings and watched it again! there is one very obvious realization that occurred to me when i saw this film- in spite of politics traditions culture etc teenagers everywhere are virtually the same the characters of the kids from belgrade could have been transported to lets say somewhere in the american midwest during the same time period and language differences aside would be impossible to tell apart from any of the local teens of that era they certainly displayed the same growing pains and preoccupations politics aside: music sex movie idols music drinking sports music as a matter of fact much the same things that occupied my time growing up in 1970s southern californiathis was a bittersweet story but the joy of youth made it very enjoyable the characters especially the young actors were completely believable also i wont say this was the yugoslav american graffiti but i will say that it fits in nicely with other 50s-themed movies<SEP>1
gespenster 2005 forms together with yella 2007 and jerichow 2008 the gespenster-trilogy of director christian petzold doubtless one of the creme-de-la-creme german movie directors of our timeroughly gespenster tells the story of a french woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3 years old child while the mother turned around her head for 1 minute in berlin - and has never been seen ever since then the mother keeps traveling to berlin whenever there is a possibility and searches by aid of time-dilated photography for girls of the age of approximately the present age of her age as we hear later in the movie the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter marie however this time when she meets nina everything comes quite differentthe movie does not bring solutions not even part-solutions and insofar it is rather disappointing we are not getting equipped either in order to decide if the mother is really insane or not if her actual daughter is still alive or not most disappointing is the end after what we have witnessed in the movie it is an imposition for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves nina alone the simple walking away symbolizing that nothing has changed can be a strong effect of dramaturgy fex in umberto d but in gespenster it is displacedsince critics have been suggesting freudian motives in this movie let me give my own attempt: why is it that similar persons do not know one another especially not the persons that another similar person knows this is quite an insane question agreed from the standpoint of aristotelian logic according to which the notion of the individual holds the individual is such a person that does not share any of its defining characteristics with anyone else so the aristotelian answer to my question is: they do not know one another because their similarity is by pure change everybody who is not insane believes that however what about the case if these similar persons share other similarities which can hardly be by change eg scarfs on their left under ankle or a heart-shaped birthmark under their right shoulder-blade this is the metaphysical context out of which this movie is made although i am not sure whether even the director has realized that despite our modern aristotelian world the superstition conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality and that individuality therefore is not something erratic but rather diffusional so that the borders between persons are open such and similar believes build a strong backbone of irrational-ism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking - a source of gespenster of the most interesting kind<SEP>1
this is a complete hoaxthe movie clearly has been shot in north western indian state of rajasthan look at the chase scene - the vehicles are indian; the writing all over is hindi - language used in india the drive through is on typical jaipur streets also the palace is in amer - about 10 miles from jaipur rajasthan the film-makers in their about the film in dvd bonus seem to make it sound that they risked their lives shooting in kabul and around almost all of their action scenes are shot in india the scene where they see a group singing around fire is so fake that they did not even think about changing it to afgani folk song they just recorded the rajasthani folk song how do i know it because i have traveled that area extensively they are just on the band-wagon to make big on the issue i do challenge the film makers to deny it<SEP>0
i caught this movie at a small screening held by members of my colleges gaming club we were forewarned that this would be the reefer madness of gaming and this movie more than deliveredtom hanks plays robbie a young man re-starting his college career after resting for a semester what we the viewer find out as the movie progresses is that robbie was hopelessly addicted to a role-playing game called mazes and monsters a game that he gets re-acquainted with after a gaming group recruit him for a campaignthis movie is laughable on many many levels one scene features the group gaming by candlelight which is probably the best way i can describe it while im sure that this was meant to be cultish in some way as most gamers know its horribly inaccurate most role-play sessions are done in well-lit rooms usually over some chee-tohs and a can of sodathe acting while not oscar-caliber isnt gut-wrenchingly awful either this is one of tom hankss first roles and bosom buddies and bachelor party were still a year or two over the horizon the supporting cast while not very memorable still hand forth decent performancesmainly the badness lies in the fact that it was a made-for-tv movie that shows the dangers of gaming worth a view if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night<SEP>0
i really liked this movie ive read a few of the other comments and although i pity those who did not understand it i do agree with some of the criticisms which in a strange way makes me like this movie all the more i accept that they have got a pretty cast to remake an intelligent movie for the general public yet it has so many levels and is still great to watch i also love the movies such as this one which provoke so many debates theories possible endings and hidden subtext congratulations mrcrowe definitely in my top tenps saw this when it first came out whilst i was backpacking in mexico it was late at night and i had to get back to my hotel and i had a major paranoia trip! where does the dream end and the real begin<SEP>1

the hg wells classic has had several incarnations the 05 speilburg version and the classic 53 version but only this one stays completely true to the book nothing is changed nothing is removedoriginally released as a 3-hour film the director re-cut the film down to 2-hours of pure excellence its got a chapter by chapter visualization of the novels pages that wells would be proud of the story is as everyone remembers martians invade the earth with capsules containing an army of tripod walking war machines the people of 19th century earth are ill-prepared to repel the alien forces and fight back with canons and guns who mes shells bound right off the walkers and when humanity is no longer a world wide power they are saved by the smallest of organisms on earththe film is an excellent accomplishment for director timothy hines who has great potential as he brought this vision to life with a meager 5 million budget today b-movies have larger budgets<SEP>1

i am stunned to discover the amount of fans this show has havent said that friends was at best an average sitcom and not as great as others have made out lets face it if it wasnt for the casting of courtney cox arquette david schwimmer matthew perry lisa kudrow jennifer aniston and matt le blanc then who knows whether this show wouldve lasted as long as it has done i very much doubt that although as the series progressed friends got more progressively predictable lame and boring that i couldnt care less about the characters- of whom are the most overrated in tv history- or of their plight nor of who was sleeping with whom and it went from being funny in the first four seasons to occasionally funny and even when it had all these a-list hollywood actors from the movie world i still didnt bother to tune in the writing in friends became stale that i lost interest in this show from the sixth season onwards and as for the ending well it was predictable to say the leastwhat was annoying though was that this lasted for ten seasons whilst some of my favourite shows lasted for only three four seasons for instance and were eventually cancelled and taken off the air for good the show shouldve came to an immediate halt by the time the cast wanted bigger salaries in truth as much as the series waned it was the show that was bigger than the actors themselves not the other way round when it ended in 2004 i was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom now there is talk of a friends reunion show coming to our tv screens very soon and yet i for one will not be looking forward to it whatsoever<SEP>0
this cartoon was strange but the story actually had a little more depth and emotion to it than other cartoon movies we have a girl at a camp with low self esteem and hardly any other friends except a brother and sister who are just a miserable as she is she reaches the ultimate low point and when the opportunity arises she literally makes a pact with a devil-like demon i found this film to be very true to life and just when things couldnt be worse the girl sees what shes done she feels remorse and then changes and then she helps this dark mystical creature learn the human quality of love the twins improve too by helping the little bears and then they get a sense of self worth too a very positive message for children though some elements of the film was strange it was and still is a rather enjoyable film the music from stephen bishop tootsie songs made the film even better<SEP>1
this is the worst movie ever made the acting the script the location everything! i would have given it a little chance if there were attractive women in the movie but even they were bad you would think that a movie with the word beach in its title would have good-looking women in it wouldnt you<SEP>0
i loved this episode it is so great that all 5 of them team up and stop luthercorp and save the world i also love this episode because kyle gallner bart allenimpulse and justin hartley oliver queengreen arrow are guest starring in it!!! i just hope that clark will join the justice league and well get to follow this group of heroes across the globe!! =it was really exciting and keeps viewers interested because of what will happen next i think chloe should also join the team as watchtower that would be such a coool thing for her to do besides the daily planet because she doesnt have super powers also i want to find out what types of subjects lex is going to use for 331 i wonder what other types of powers other people in the world have!!!<SEP>1
this movie proves that good acting comes from good direction and this does not happen in ask the dust colin farrell is usually a fine actor but in this he is juvenile donald sutherland comes across as an amateur why because the script is awful the adaptation is awful and the actors seem bored and half hearted the atmosphere of the movie is bad - i could only think when it would finish and i turned it off half way the director has done a very poor job and even though i have not read the novel it is certainly a missed chance the atmosphere this film is trying to evoke and the message and storyline never reaches the audience in one word it is a terrible film<SEP>0
this is a excellent start to the film career of mickey rooney his talents here shows that a long career is ahead for him the car and truck chase is exciting for the 1937 era this start of the andy hardy series is an american treasure in my book spring byington performance is excellent as usual please mr rooney or owners of the film rights take a chance and get this produced on dvd i think it would be a winner<SEP>1
despite unfortunately thinking itself to be a intelligent b important and c interesting fortunately this movie is over mercifully quickly the script makes little sense the whole idea of the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely trite and john lydon shows us all in the space of one movie why he should never have let himself out of music his performance is one-note and irritatingthe only positive thing to be said is that harvey keitel manages to deliver a good turn his later bad lieutenant would show just how badly good actors can act but mercifully his performance here is restrained<SEP>0
joel schumaker directs the script he co-wrote and has a group of georgetown grads confronted with adult life situations the story line is a scrambled mess but some scenes are actually good there is a lot of wasted talent and time here the cast is more impressive than the movie featured are demi moore rob lowe judd nelson andrew mccarthy emilio estevez ally sheedy and mare winningham the most notable being mccarthy and moore lowe is quite obnoxious coming of age is not so damn easy<SEP>0
this is a great film!! the first time i saw it i thought it was absorbing from start to finish and i still do now i may not have seen the play but even if i had it wouldnt stop me thinking that the film is just as good<SEP>1
after watching a dozen episodes i decided to give up on this show since it depicts in an unrealistic manner what is mathematical modeling in the episodes that charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models i thought that my profession was being joked about i am not a mathematician instead a chemical engineer but i do work a lot with mathematical models so i will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to make-believe of fairy talesfirst choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task charlie eppes is shown as a genius but even him would have to spend considerable time researching for a suitable model specifically for trying to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future individuals are erratic and haphazard there is no modeling for them isaac asimov even wrote about that in the 1950s even if there were a model for specific kind of individual it would be a probabilistic stoichastic one meaning it has good chance of making a wrong predictionsecond supposing the right model for someone or a situation is found the model parameters have to be known these parameters are the constants of the equations such as the gravity acceleration 98 ms2 and often are not easy to determine again charlie eppes would have to be someone beyond genius to know the right parameters for the model he chooses and after the model and the parameters are chosen they would have to be tested oddly they are not and by miracle they fit exactly the situation that is being predictedthird a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected not only by numbers but also by sci-fi movies: the computational effort required for solving these models try to make excel solve a complex model with many equations and variables and one will find doing a herculean job even if charlie eppes has the right software to solve his models he might be stuck with hardware that will be dreadfully slow and even with the right softwarehardware combination the model solution might well take days to be reached he solves them immediately! i could use his computer in my research work i would be very gladas a drama it is far from being the best show the characters are somewhat stereotyped but not even remotely funny as those in big bang theory are the crimes are dull and the way charlie eppes solves them sometimes make the fbi look pretty incompetentfor some layman the show might work for others the way things are handled makes it difficult to swallow!<SEP>0
how many more of those fake slice of life movies need to be made hopefully not too manyraising victor vargas is a very self-conscious attempt by the director peter solett at garnering the attention of hollywood nothing wrong with that in general what is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every cliché in the book of supposedly edgy hollywood independent productionits supposed to be real so left shake the camera documentary style except no documentarian would shake the camera on purposeits edgy so lets not waste any time lighting the filmits hip so lets have the children use swear words like al pacino in scarfaceand so on and so forth all that you are left with is a very self-conscious attempt at impressing hollywood that wont impress anyone outside of the rarefied indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film<SEP>0
the tenant is roman polanskis greatest film imo and i love chinatown but this one is so much more original and unconventional and downright creepy its also a great black comedy some people i have shown this film to have been *very disturbed* by it afterwards so be forewarned it does affect some people that way polanski does a great job acting the lead role in the tenant as well as directing it<SEP>1
my wife and i like to rent really stupid horrorsci-fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh we saw this one on fullmoondirectcom and decided to add it to our netflix list now when i say this movie is awful i mean it in a good way everything about it the acting camera-work story costumes is just so cheezy and low budget but thats what makes it so good i think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place i really hope that whoever made this film wasnt serious when they made it because if they were then that would just be sad if you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them then i recommend this one<SEP>0
phantasm class phantasm iiawesome phantasm iiiermterribleeven though i would love to stick up for this film i quite simply cant the movie seems to have sold out first bad signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start something the others did not also too many pointless characters prime examples the kid who is a crack shot funny initially but soon you want him dead the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls erm not gonna work or rather shouldnt and the blooming zombies what the hell are they doing there there no link to them in the other phatasms also there is a severe lack of midgets running aboutthe only good bits are the cracking start and of course reggie bpossible spoiler coming upto me this film seems like a filler between ii and iv as extra characters just leave at the end so can continue with main 4 in ivoverall very very disappointing 3 10<SEP>0
this animated inspector gadget movie is pretty lamethe story is very weakand there is little actionmost of the characters are given little to nothing to dothe movie is mildly entertaining at bestbut really doesnt go any where and is pointlessits watchable but only just and is nowhere near the calibre of the animated tv show from the 80sits not a movie that bears repeat viewingat least in my mindits only about 74 minutes long including creditsso i guess thats a good thingunlike in the tv showthe characters are not worth rooting for herein the showyou wanted inspector gadget to save the daybut therewho really caresanywaythats just my opinionfor me inspector gadgets last case is a disappointing 310<SEP>0
this has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy-meets-girl movies ever made while rebel without a cause and say anything deliver nice portrayals this movies strips down useless subplots and hollywood divergences this movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance you never doubt for a second that the film will lead towards the romantic pairing of these two people you almost immediately sense the synergy and the chemistry between jesse and celine and it is simply pure joy to watch them find it this movie is mostly all dialogue -based but every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing what makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is how in all that conversation while often having no real bearing on anything critical you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other this is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone and what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe this could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random and what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of vienna in which this film takes place it just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests and no matter how many times i watch this film i dont think i will ever tire of that<SEP>1
words are seriously not enough convey the emotional power of this film; its one of the most wrenching youll ever see yet the ending is one of the most loving tender and emotionally fulfilling you could hope for every actor in every role is terrific especially a wise and understated jamie lee curtis a tightly wound and anguished ray liotta and a heart-stopping turn from tom hulce that should have had him up for every award in the book hes the #1 pick for 1988s best actor in danny pearys alternate oscars the last half hour borders on melodrama but the film earns every one of its tears--and unless youre made of stone there will be plenty of them<SEP>1
full house is a great show i am still today growing up on it i started watching it when i was 8 and now i am 12 and still watching it i fell in love with all of the characters especially stephanie she is my favorite she had such a sense of humor in case there are people on this sight that hardly watch the show you should because you will get hooked on it i became hooked on it after the first show i saw which just happened to be the first episode in 2002 it really is a good show i really think that this show should go down to many generations in families and its great too because it is an appropriate show for all ages and for all parents it teaches kids lessons on how to go on with their life nothing terrible happens like violence or swearing it is just a really great sit-com i give it 5 out of 5 stars what do you think oh and the best time to watch it is when you are home sick from school or even the old office it will make you feel a lot better trust me i am hardly home sick but i still know that it will make you feel better and to everybody that thinks the show is stupid well thats too bad for you because you wont get as far in life even if you are happy with your life you really should watch it and you will get hooked on it i am just telling you what happened to me and everybody else that started watching this awesome show well i need must go to have some lunch remember you must start watching full house and soon!<SEP>1
lame movie completely uninteresting no chemistry at all between indiana jones and the guy from black hawk down the car chase scene just goes on and on and on ad nauseum they manage to switch vehicles a few times but always end up right on the tail of the baddies the scene where hartnett grabs the familys car with the crying kids in the back was just as stupid as could be he is telling them about eastern philosophy and how it is all right to die which i imagine the writers thought was funny or even witty it just came off as moronic totally unbelievable and even cruelsome subplots werent even explored they were just used as filler why does hartnett get sick seeing dead bodies yet keeps ordering burgers at crime scenes why and on what grounds is the bad ia guy suddenly arrested out of the blue by the chief why can ia pick up the buddy cops and then just let them answer their phones or pretend to be indian mystics and then just let them waltz out of there without so much as a slap on the wrist for some reason even though ford is uncovered as a cheat and a fraud when acting as a realtor he makes up the prices when he is trying to sell the producers house to jack up his own commission they keep coming back to him anyway! they knew he lied to both of them! yet there they were coming to terms that both said they would never go for stupid just stupid this is also one of those cop movies where they just fire wantonly on public streets with no care in the world for innocent bystanders there they were just standing on the sidewalk blasting away while people ducked for cover amazing that they didnt hit a single person after having fired about 60 rounds eachthe scriptwriting was terrible the action sequences were boring the plot just a sidestory to a very pathetic attempt to have us root for ford and hartnett it fails miserably and fords phone! turn the damn thing off! how many times could it ring in a 2-hour movie 50 60 it was frustratingly aggravating by the midpoint in the movie! every 30 seconds that stupid tune would play! and if it wasnt fords then hartnetts was ringing! it was incredibly annoying!complete waste of time fords worst movie since 6 days 7 nights which was without a doubt the lowest point of his distinguished career<SEP>0
if you want to watch a film that is oddly shot oddly lit weird stories of these men and one woman who enjoy beating the crap out of each other if you want to enjoy a story that goes nowhere of these two guys one a boxer and the other a gay man then you should watch this filmafter watching this film i almost felt as badly bruised up and cut up like the director of the film himself beat the hell out of methis is a movie where one is not meant to watch for plot or for great acting this is a film to gawk at in horror and wonder a lot like watching an airplane crash or a train wreckif you want to watch a great movie a good movie a b movie or even a mediocre movie this movie is not ita warning to all who watch this film please dont eat beforehand you might want to puke by the end of the film<SEP>0
what an unusual movieabsolutely no concessions are made to hollywood special effects or entertainment there is no background music not special effects or enhanced soundfacial expressions are usually covered by thick beards and the spanish language is a strange monotonic lilt that sounds the same whether in the midst of a battle or talking around a campfirei sort of viewed these movies parts 1 and 2 as an educational experience not really something to go and get entertained by its quite long and in places dullbut i suspect that given the lack of any plot development i dont think its very educational eitherits also difficult to perceive any story from the movie dialogue - it would be a good idea to read up a little on the history so that you can understand the context of what is happening since for some reason the director didnt see fit to inform the audience why ches band was moving around the way they did - as a result there seem to be groups skulking around the woodland for no particular reason and getting shot ati would have loved to give this movie more stars for somehow generating more empathy with me and developing depth of character but somehow all of the characters were still strangers to me at the end the stars it gets are for realism and showing the hardships of guerrilla warfare<SEP>0
i loved this movie! it was all i could do not to break down into tears while watching it but it is really very uplifting i was struck by the performance of ray liotta but especially the talent of tom hulce portraying rays twin brother who is mentally slow due to a tragic and terrible childhood event but toms character though heartbreaking knows no self pity and is so full of hope and life this is a great movie dont miss it!!<SEP>1
in all honesty if someone told me the director of lemony snickets series of unfortunate events city of angels and caspers was going to do a neat little low budget indie film and thatd it be real good id say that person must be joking but thats what director brad siberling did and it was really good10 items or less has a similar conceit to films like before sunrise lost in translation or more recently once it involves the chance meeting of two people who if serendipity didnt put them there theyd probably never cross paths or if they did they wouldnt say word one to each other like those films 10 items or less focuses on the relationship that builds and how the characters come to understand each other and build on each others strengths and weaknessesthe story involves morgan freeman playing an unnamed actor who goes to research his role as a grocery store employee for an upcoming independent movie and because of things beyond his control ends up spending the day with the lady in the 10 items or less lane played by paz vega she has a rotten marriage and is hoping to land a new job as a secretary initially freemans character just needs a lift home after spending time with her however he wants to get to know her and maybe even offer her some advicebrad siberling builds the characters almost entirely through the exchanges between freeman and vega the plot is merely a setup for these two characters to interact with each other for most of the films 80 minute duration freeman has fun with his character as he appears an outsider in lower class world that vegas character scarlett inhabits vega in the meantime grows beyond the stubborn checkout clerk upset with her lifes situation looking to move onthere a couple things that really stood out in this film first of all siberling has probably taken note from independent cinema to make sure the relationship is sincere and doesnt fall into any hollywood pitfalls its a very mutual friendship that develops convincingly throughout the film it works even though the situation itself does seem a little inconceivablei am also impressed with the performances while freemans presence gives this film credibility from the get-go he shows a certain amount of charm and fun not usually seen from him paz vega meanwhile is priming herself for a breakthrough in us film sometime in the future i loved her in spanglish and shes equally good here as the tough no-nonsense scarlet towards the end of the film she successfully conveys the growth of her character im looking forward to seeing her in more filmsoverall 10 items of less functions best as a character piece well scripted and directed by brad siberling he hasnt done much writing and his feature film work has consisted mostly of big hollywood films yet theres certainly an artist at work here and am anxious to see if hell take this road again<SEP>1
i hope whoever coached these losers on their accents was fired the only high points are a few of the supporting characters 3 of 5 of my favourites were killed off by the end of the season and one of them was a cat to put that into perspectivethe whole storyline is centered around sex and nothing else sex with vampires gay sex with gay vampires gay sex with straight vampires sex to score vampire blood sex after drinking vampire blood sex in front of vampires vampire sex non-vampire sex sex because were scared of vampires sex because were mad at vampires sex because we just became a vampire etcnothing against sex it would just be nice if it were a little more subtle with being peppered into the storyline perhaps have a storyline and then shoehorn some sex into it but they didnt even bother to do that and anna paquin is a dizzy gap-tooth bitch either she sucks or her character sucks i cant figure out whichanother part of the storyline that i find highly implausible is why 150 year old vampire bill who seems to have his things together would be interested in someone like sookie shes constantly flying off the handle at him for things he cant control he leaves for two days and she already decides that hes not coming back and suddenly has feelings for dog-man give me a break shes supposed to be a 25 year old woman not a 14 year old girl people close to her are dying all over and shes got the brightest smile on her face because she just gave away her v-card to some dude because she cant read his mind as the main character of the story i wouldve hoped the show would do a little more to make her understandable and someone to invest your interest in not someone you keep secretly hoping gets killed off or put into a coma i cant find anything about her character that i like and even the fact that she can read minds is impressively uninspiring and not the least bit interestingi will not be wasting my time with watching season 2 come june<SEP>0
the animation looks like it was done in 30 seconds and looks more like caricatures rather than characters ive been a fan of scooby doo ever since the series premiered in 1969 i didnt think much of the scooby doo animated movies im talking about the tv series not the full length movies but some of them were pretty cool and i like most people found scrappy doo to be an irritant but this series is pure garbage as soon as i saw the animation and heard the characters and i use that term loosely speak i cringed also mystery inc was a team and without the entire crew to compliment each other it just seems like opening up a box of chocolates to find someone has already ate the best ones and the only thing left are the ones nobody wants whats new scooby doo was better than this if youre going to have a scooby doo tv series include the elements that made the series endure so long the entire cast of characters and quality animation they need to put this one back under the rock from where it came<SEP>0
im a fan of matthew modine but this film--which i stumbled upon on cable--is absolutely witless i see that the screenwriter and director were one and the same so there was no one around to check her worst instincts there are no surprises no original lines and no original characters the goldfish was basically the most sympathetic character what a waste of all this acting talent given how expensive it is to film in new york these days i have to wonder how this got made in the first place and if youre wondering why i watched it at all it came on after a film that i like on cable and i left it on while i worked at the computer its not a very demanding picture!<SEP>0
and that is the only reason i posses this dvd now i havent seen the first nemesis film but i did check the info out of it and i here by say: what why because in the first film alex was male but then again the first one was set in the future so maybe this alex is brand new one and the scientist just happened to make alex female this time who knows at least it wasnt addressed in the film in any wayheres a quick summary of the plot: alex still a baby then or how ever you want as it was is in the future escapes with her mom using a special time vessel and ends up in the 80s africa there mommy gets killed and alex sue price grows up in a african tribe then the tribe gets slaughtered by a cyborg from the future and alex then runs and hides and finally she kills the cyborg so there does sound familiar doesnt itterminator isnt the only film being ripped here predator gets its fair share too and i think the first fly movie the vincent price one gets special nomination for giving a solid base to build up your cyborgs head fromlets see what else okay the film was quite standard small budget flick but it did have bad special effects for a mid 90s film it would have looked okay for a 80s flick how ever biggest problem is the plot things just happen and the viewer is barely interested nemesis 2 isnt the crappiest piece of cinema ive had pleasure to watch but it does come damn closei wont say a thing about acting because lets be honest here: did anyone expect oscar worthy performances here oh well at least i did find sue price hot in that amazonian warrior waya real movie rating: 210 there isnt a lot of pros about the over all quality and despite of the very basic plot the film it self makes very little sensea camp movie rating: 410 i did get occasional laughs from the sheer badness of the film so it does have small merits in it<SEP>0
we first watched this film as part of a festival of new argentine films in 2000 at the walter reade although we liked it we didnt think it was extraordinary watching it for a second time we found a different meaning in this look at life in buenos airesthe film takes place in one of the darkest days of argentina as the delarua administration was ending the country was in turmoil after the economy which had flourished earlier in the 1990s under the artificially climate president menen created it was a time when bank accounts in dollars were frozen and people got themselves living a nightmarethe story begins just as santamarina a bank employee is fired because the collapse of the economy instead of receiving sympathy from his wife she locks him out of the apartment and he for all practical purposes becomes a homeless man he takes to the streets trying to make ends meetthe other story introduces us to ariel a young jew interviewing for a job in a spanish company its almost a miracle he gets the job his father simon owns a small restaurant in the jewish quarter of el once in the center of the city things go from bad to worse when ariels mother dies suddenly only estela the young woman who is in love with ariel comes to help father and sonsantamarina who is a clean man has to resort to take showers wherever he can he chooses a ladies room in one of the subway stations when the attendant elsa finds him naked she becomes furious but she comes to her senses when she realizes the unhappy circumstances of this man who has seen better times they become romantically involved and santamarina in one of his trips through the street garbage finds an infant elsa while surprised wants to do the right thing but santamarina convinces her of the meaning of an innocent life in their lives will cement their loveariel who has met the gorgeous laura at work begins a turbulent and heavy sexual affair with his beautiful co-worker who unknown to him is involved in a lesbian affair ariel who free lances by photographing weddings and other occasions feels a passion for laura but he realizes what estela has sacrificed in order to help his father and still loves himdaniel burman whose el abrazo partido we thought was excellent did wonders with this film things are put in its proper perspective after a second viewing recently and we must apologize for not having perceived it the first time around if anything this second time the nuances of the screen play mr burman and emiliano torres wrote make more sense because they reflect the turmoil of what the country was living during those dark daysdaniel hendler who plays ariel has collaborated with mr burman before to surprising results he is not movie star pretty yet he is handsome this actor projects a tremendous sincerity in his work enrique pineyro is another magnificent surprise his santamarina is disarming in spite of all the bad things that have fallen on him he keeps a rosy attitude toward everyone he meets stefania sandrelli the interesting italian actress makes a great contribution to the film with her elsa hector alterio one of the best argentine actors plays the small part of simon the gorgeous chiara coselli is seen as laura and melina petrielli appears as the noble estelaesperando al mesias proves daniel burman is a voice to be reckoned with in the argentine cinema<SEP>1
as a jane eyre fan i was excited when this movie came out at last i thought someone will make this book into a movie following the story actually written by the author wrong!!! if the casting director was intending to cast a jane who was plain he certainly succeeded however surely he could have found one who could also act where was the tension between jane and rochester where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter floated into the night seemingly from nowhere where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother finally why was the plot changed at the end one wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book what a disappointment<SEP>0
spoiler warning: there are some minor spoilers in this review dont read it beyond the first paragraph if you plan on seeing the filmthe disney channel currently has a policy to make loads of movies and show one a month on the cable channel most of these are mediocre and drab having a few good elements but still being a disappointment `phantom of the megaplex `stepsister from planet weird `zenon: girl of the 21st century every once in a great while they make something really really great `genius `the other me but once in a while the disney channel makes a huge mistake and gives us a real stinker this month december 2000 the disney channel featured `the ultimate christmas present which i thought was terrible due to poor writing and worse acting apparently `the brainiacscom was rushed out a few days before christmas to get a jump on the holiday because the plot has to do with toys they even paid for a feature in the tv guide so i thought it must be better than the norm i was in for a complete shock only disneys `model behaviour has been worse than thisthe plot was more far-fetched than normal i usually let that slide but here it just goes too far matthew tyler gets very sick of his widowed father spending most of his time at work his father owns a small toy factory that has taken out large loans at a scrupulous bank to stay afloat time and time again his father has to skip out on the plans he makes with his son and daughter matthew decides that the only way he can spend time with his dad is if he becomes the boss and orders him to stay home he gets a hair-brained idea to create a website where kids all around the world can find and send him a dollar to invest in a computer chip that his sister is inventing that whole concept is full of fallacies when kids send in millions of dollars matthew opens his own companys bank account and buys up most of his dads businesss stock he is the secret boss but he doesnt reveal this to his dad but instead presents himself at board meetings as a cartoon image through a computer that image itself is so complex and ridiculous that it isnt possible for someone to create it at home much less someone who comes across as stupid as matthew to make a long plot short matthew orders his dad to spend more time having fun and doing stuff with his kids but a federal agent shows up inquiring about matthews company as it is fraudulenttheres so much wrong here as mentioned the stuff they do here is impossible even for true geniuses which these kids are not the website the cartoon image the computer chip even the stuff they are being taught in school are far too advanced for these kids the acting by most of the cast especially kevin kilner is terrible some familiar faces are wasted dom deluise plays the evil bank owner but his part is a throwaway he has one good scene with alexandra paul who shows she has the ability to act in which he explains his motives but nothing more and rich little is wasted in a small role as a judge theres even some offensive and uncalled for anti-russian jokes but the greatest atrocities are the hard-hammered themes these themes show up in many of the disney channels films but never before have these ultra-conservative messages been pounded so strongly the typical `overworking parent idea is really pushed hard and after delivering it inappropriately in `the ultimate christmas present seeing it again sours my mood family relations are important but disney must stop this endless preaching because working is important to maintaining a workable family too except for cancelling activities thanks to work the father didnt come across as that bad but i found it offensive when the grandmother told him `i dont like what i see just as bad is the preaching of the idea that all single parents must marry if they want to raise their kids right enter alexandra paul whose character while important to the plot is there solely to be the love interest for the father this offensiveness only proves that the disney brain trust lacks the brains to avoid scraping from the bottom of the disney script barrel instead of letting this movie teach your kids how to commit serious fraud wait for the next disney channel movie it has to be better than this zantaras score: 1 out of 10<SEP>0
from the opening scene aboard a crowded train where a ruthless pickpocket is at work richard widmark stealing from a womans purse jean peters pickup on south street is relentlessly fascinating to watch partly its because the acting is uniformly strong from the entire cast the b&w photography is crisp and adds to the starkness of the story and characters and because samuel fullers direction puts him in the same league with the biggies like john asphalt jungle huston in fact it has the same urgency as the huston film about a heist that goes wrong--but the payoff is not quite as strongjean peters is excellent as the hard-edged girl whom widmark describes as being knocked around a lot she gives a lot of raw energy and sex appeal to her role of the not too bright woman carrying a micro-film in her purse for her boyfriend richard kiley something the fbi already knows about theyre on her trail when the theft occursthelma ritter adds realism to her portrait of a woman called moe who buys and sells anything to make a profit and ends up paying for it with her life shes particularly touching in her final scene with kileythis one is guaranteed to hold your attention through its one hour and twenty minute running time good noir from fox and notable for the performances of widmark peters and ritter<SEP>1
this is an excellent film dealing with a potentially exploitative subject with great sensitivity anne reid previously best known in the uk for her tv roles including dinnerladies a victoria wood scripted series on in-company catering workers if youre wondering gives a performance of finely judged understatement as may a late-60s bereaved mother of two chattering class adults in an inner-london borough her husband toots peter vaughan dies on their visit to the male of the latter species bobby and we see the pair being rather casually greeted by bobby and his family mays teacher daughter paula cathryn bradshaw lives nearby however and the relationship between may and paula initially appears closer thus when may decides she cannot live in her own home and comes back to london she is able to stay in paulas house and do some child-minding of paulas more appreciative offspringit is on mays visits to bobbys house that she embarks on an affair with darren a mid-30s friend of bobby who is working on a house extension in what may be the first mainstream british film to so portray it it is may and not darren daniel craig* who initiates the encounter and at least to begin with it seems that the relationship is founded on mutual respect there is no explicit sexual content at least in the dvd i saw: differences in the imdb cast list suggests the existence of other versions and the physical basis of the affair is handled directly but not exploitatively more strongly portrayed is the relationship between may and daughter paula a recent convert to therapy and self-exploration who announces that mummy has never been supportive of her paula is also darrens lover and when she finds mays explicit but rather poor drawings of darren and may together things go downhill in dramatic but controlled fashion only in an english film perhaps could a daughter announce that she is going to hit her mother politely ask her to stand up and duly wallop herin the mean time may is being drawn into a putative relationship with a decent but older of her own generation member of paulas writing group the contrast between the ensuing unwanted intercourse and her affair with darren is clearly made; it is at that point that may starts to acquiesce to paula and darrens worm begins to turn he reveals on cocaine that he may have been after her money if not all along but for some of the ride so may finds herself superfluous to both of her childrens needs and finally does return home but later leaves on a jet plane for pastures newthe films strength is that it portrays with unflinching but sympathetic truth the nature of contemporary adult parent-sibling relationships where bereavement may leave the surviving parent feeling more alone than if they had no-one to care for them this is not new but the openness of the portrayal of sexual need in the over-60s may well be the darkness of the films content from a screenplay by hanif kureishi stands in contrast to the way in which it is lit it seems to be perpetual summer and the overall mood is uplifting - it could so easily have been yet another piece set in a dour and rainy england the ending is perhaps under-written as we dont know where may is going or for how long - perhaps shes shirley valentine with a pension shes certainly no picasso anne reid is however revealed as a fine actor whose professional life will surely have changed forever like julie andrews in torn curtain said by paul newman there goes your mary poppins {read dinnerladies} image for good* yes he: announced oct 2005 as the new james bond<SEP>1
pickup on south street 1953 directed by movie maverick samuel fuller contains a stunning opening that establishes a double complication subway rider candy susan peters collides with pickpocket skip mccoy richard widmark dipped in shades of sinatra cool shes unaware that she carries valuable microfilm; mccoy is unaware of grifting it both are unaware of being observed by two federal agents thus the grift sets in motion a degree of knowledges candy is doubly watched skip and the police and therefore doubly naive; skip the overconfident petty thief is singularly unaware trailed by federal agents; the feds all knowing are ultimately helpless they cant stop the passing of government secrets or the spread of communism<SEP>1
one of scorseses worst an average thriller; the only thing to recommend it is de niro playing the psycho the finale is typically of this genre ie over-the-top with yet another almost invincible immune-to-pain villain i didnt like the 60s original and this version wasnt much of an improvement on it i have no idea why scorsese wasted his time on a remake then again considering how bad his recent movies have been im referring to his dull buddhist movie and all the ones with his new favourite actress the blond girl di caprio this isnt even that bad by comparison and considering spielberg wanted to do the remake could have been far worse<SEP>0
i first came across my tutor friend accidentally one or two years ago while tv surfing prior to that id never watched any korean films before in my whole life so mtf was really the first korean film ive ever watched and- what a delightful surprise! i was thoroughly amused from the beginning to end and had a great time laughing its comic style is quite different from those of the hong kong comic films which ive been to used to all my life and hence tired of as well breathing fresh air into my humdrum film viewing experience i thought therere quite a few scenes and tricks in mtf that are pretty hilarious witty and original tooi watched mtf the second time a few days ago and having watched it once already the surprisecomic effect on me kind of mitigated that has however by no means affected negatively my opinion of the film instead something else came through this time- it moved me- the story about how two young seemingly enemies whore utterly incompatible get thrown together and how they gradually resolve their differences and start caring for each other without realizing the feelings themselves reminds me of the long gone high school days to me su wan and ji hoon are actually compatible as they both have something that is pure and genuine inside them a quality that separates them from people like say ji hoons sassy girlfriendthe film is divided into two distinct parts- the 1st part deals with the fight between su wan and ji hoon and is more violent and faster in pace after ji hoon gets a pass in his final examination and su wan dances the in ji hoons opinion provocative dance things start to change the pace slows down and ji hoon suddenly realizes he cares for su wan more than he could ever imagine so the 2nd part deals with the development of their mutual feelings leading of course to a happy ending accompanied by a final showdown with the gang bossjust one last comment i find this to be a bit unbelievable- the fact that a 21-year-old self-proclaimed bad boy would feel embarrassed being almost naked in front of the girl he bullies and loses his cool is just a little odd i guess that shows that ji hoon is just a boy pure at heart and isnt really what his appearance seems btw kwong san woo ji hoon does have a sexy body and perfect figure! ;- mtf is definitely on my list of top 10 favorite films of all time<SEP>1
homelessness or houselessness as george carlin stated has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school work or vote for the matter most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism the war on iraq pressuring kids to succeed technology the elections inflation or worrying if theyll be next to end up on the streetsbut what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home the entertainment sets a bathroom pictures on the wall a computer and everything you once treasure to see what its like to be homeless that is goddard bolts lessonmel brooks who directs who stars as bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival jeffery tambor to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries; if bolt succeeds he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings the bets on where bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he cant step off the sidewalk hes given the nickname pepto by a vagrant after its written on his forehead where bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly lesley ann warren an ex-dancer who got divorce before losing her home and her pals sailor howard morris and fumes teddy wilson who are already used to the streets theyre survivors bolt isnt hes not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where its fight or flight kill or be killedwhile the love connection between molly and bolt wasnt necessary to plot i found life stinks to be one of mel brooks observant films where prior to being a comedy it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles young frankenstein or spaceballs for the matter to show what its like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they dont know what to do with their money maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly moneyor maybe this film will inspire you to help others<SEP>1
much underrated camp movie on the level of cobra woman etc photographic stills resemble rembrandt prints sometimes subtle dialog and hidden literate touches found throughout<SEP>1
no redeeming features this film is rubbish its jokes dont begin to be funny the humour for children is pathetic and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next i couldnt enjoy the film at all although my child for whom the dvd was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new dvd neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again unlike with monsters inc finding nemo jungle book lion king etc which all get frequent requests for replays<SEP>0
while the premise behind the house where evil dwells may be intriguing the execution is downright pathetic im not even sure where to begin as ive got so many problems with this movie i suppose ill just number a few of them: 1 the acting  when you see that edward albert doug mcclure and susan george and her teeth are the stars of your movie you know youre in trouble not that it matters much to me but these are hardly a-list names susan george may have been in a couple of movies i enjoy but ive never considered her the greatest actress ive ever seen and in this movie her acting is embarrassing as for the other two the less said the better2 the ghosts  the ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me quite a bit of the ghosts in the haunted mansion rideat disney world and they are about as frightening and why did they have to be so obvious subtlety is not a characteristic of the house where evil dwells3 the plot  how predictable can one movie be the outcome of this movie is painfully obvious once you meet the three main characters if you couldnt see where this movie was headed after about 15 minutes you need to see more movies4 the convenient priest  what are the chances that the haunted house you buy just happens to be across the street from a group of japanese monks not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and comes over knocks on the door and asks if you need help removing evil spirits absurd is a word that comes to mind5 everything else  its very difficult for me to think of any positives to write about i suppose ill give it a point for the opening scene and a point for the houses architecture thats a sure sign of a winner  noting the architecture as a highlight of any film doesnt say much about the actual movieill stop you should be able to get the idea from what ive already mentioned and i havent even mentioned the annoying little girl or the invasion of the crabs or a multitude of other problems be warned this thing is horrible<SEP>0
i dont quite know how to explain darkend room because to summarize it wouldnt really do it justice its a quintessentially lynchian short film with two beautiful girls in a strange mysterious situation i would say this short is definitely more on the mulholland drive end of the lynchian spectrum as opposed to the elephant man or the straight story its hidden on lynchs website and well worth the search<SEP>1
freddys dead: the final nightmare starts as dream demon freddy krueger robert englund leaves a teenager shon greenblatt on the outskirts of springwood with no memory of himself who he is or why he is there the local police pick him up & take him to a youth centre where child psychiatrist maggie burroughs lisa zane interviews him she finds a newspaper cutting in his pocket which leads the two to elm street in springwood where they discover that no children live there & therefore no victims for freddy kill anyone it all turns out that its an elaborate plan by freddy to find his daughter & use her to escape springwood when maggie realises what freddy is up to her & some kids decide they have to kill freddy once & for alldirected by rachel talalay this was made with the intention of being the final a nightmare on elm street film which by this time had reached five of course as any horror film fan knows if theres still money to be made from a franchise or a character then theres no way in hell freddys dead: the final nightmare was going to be the last one which of course it wasnt the a nightmare on elm street series has been a franchise of diminishing returns as the films dropped in quality as the series progressed until we got here & freddys dead: the final nightmare which for my money is probably the worst out of the lot of them the film moves at a reasonable pace & its rarely boring but its so silly childish & feels like some sort of live-action cartoon with some awful set-piece horror scenes that seem a million miles from wes cravens suspenseful & effective early 80s original the sequence where stoner spencer is trapped inside a video game being played by freddy is terrible on its own but then we are treated to shots of his body back in reality bouncing around the house from wall to wall & floor to ceiling which is quite the most ridiculous thing ive seen in a while or maybe the early scenes when the john doe kid falls from a plane down to the ground just like the coyote cartoon character in the road runner cartoons or the absurd sight of freddy threatening the deaf carlos with pins that he intends to drop to the floor to make a loud noise or when he eventually kills him by scraping his knives across a blackboard you cant take this seriously & i was just sitting there not quite believing what i was seeing when they do finally try to kill freddy the hero is given a secret powerful special weapon yeah thats right a pair of cardboard 3-d glasses! the characters are poor the dialogue is poor & the plot is confusing it doesnt really stick to the elm street continuity & overall the film is a bit of a mess the best thing i can say about it is that it has quite a bit of unintentional humour & you can certainly laugh at itthe film has major tonal problems as it tries to be dark scary & sinister yet its so silly & simply looks ridiculous at times that any attempt at being serious falls completely flat theres not much gore in this one theres some cut off fingers some stabbings someone falls on a bed of nails & thats about it the body count is extremely low here with only three deaths the final twenty or so minutes of freddys dead: the final nightmare was in fact shot in 3-d although the version i saw presented this part as normal so i cant comment on how well this does or doesnt work but you can definitely see shots which are meant to be seen in 3-d which take advantage of the process the special effects vary some are quite good actually while others are terrible & freddys burnt make-up this time looks quite poorthis apparently had a budget of about $5000000 it had an opening weekend box-office take of $12000000 & the film has a few nice visual touches & gags which makes the thing feel even more cartoony than it already is the acting is really poor from the main leads although there are a few odd cameos including tom arnold & roseanne johnny depp & rocker alice cooperfreddys dead: the final nightmare is probably the worst of the entire series & apart from some unintentional laugh value theres not much here to recommend or enjoy fans of the series will probably like it & defend it but for me this is about as far from wes cravens original classic shocker as it gets followed by new nightmare 1994 which tried to take freddy krueger & the series in a new & different direction<SEP>0
i took a flyer in renting this movie but i gotta say it was very very good on all fronts: script cast director photography and high production values etc proves eva longoria parker is head and shoulders in romcom above bad actors such as kate hudson and jennifer aniston who mug and call it acting whoda thunk itparker and isla fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to hold out for projects as good as over her dead body lake bell is excellent too and this is the first time i have seen her and finally paul rudd gets to shine in a really good movie instead of lesser filmsa movie like this never gets its dues from close-minded males its too bad as other imdb reviewers here have noted there is nothing lame about this gem --no hack writing or acting and its depiction of contemporary la and california in general makes every scene look bright beautiful clean and otherwise outstanding in every way never before has a movie made la look so good ah what a little talent and a lot of caring can do for a moviei wont divulge the plot but as a long-time and hard-core atheist i was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme in order to enjoy an excellent and light-hearted piece of entertainment it reminds me very much of the old topper movies which were also so enjoyablethis movie exposes popular but otherwise hackneyed movies like ghost for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap fests they are we already know the public taste leans heavily toward the mediocre some of us save our praise for the truly worthy howeverif you have enjoyed other overlooked gems such as into the night with michelle pfeiffer jeff goldblum and clu gulager blind date with bruce willis and kim basinger american dreamer with jobeth williams chances are with robert downey jr christopher mcdonald and cybil sheppard making mr right with john malkovich etc youll enjoy this a first-rate job all around even if its kinda hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years but even that plot device doesnt detract from the movies overall excellence<SEP>1
this is the kind of movie hollywood needs to make more of no extravagant props no car chases no clever one-liners just people dealing with being peoplewilliam macy plays an unlikely hitman who works for his father donald sutherland macy is the dutiful son sutherland is the domineering father son wants out of the business father wont let him macy loves his own son played beautifully by david dorfman the ring he also starts to fall in love with neve campbell a girl he meets in the waiting room of his psychiatrists officeits an interesting juxtaposition of characters and the film follows the reluctant killer as he balances his own needs with those of his family there are many touching scenes especially between macy and his little boy and as youd expect in a film with william macy in it theres a bit of humor tooexcellent job all around actors and director nice to know they can still make a good film in hollywood on a small budget<SEP>1
i went to see this one with much expectation quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest even a child can see the missing logic to characters behaviors todays kids need creative stories which would inspire them which would make them daydream about the events thats precisely what happened with movies like et and star wars a decade ago how many kids imagined about becoming jedi knights and igniting their own lightsabers seriously dont waste your time & money on this one<SEP>0
i borrowed this movie because not only because its gay theme but the thought of role playing really intrigued me i was pleasantly surprised that it was shot in san francisco since i live near sf and of course it was nice to see shots of the castro district although the castro to me really caters more to gay male than female but other than that i cant really recommend this movie the characters arent really developed for me to care and when they finally started to get to the role playing i was already bored out of my mind and the role playing scenes that i did see were a bit embarrassing to watch the acting leaves something to be desired needless to say i didnt finish the movie id skip this one<SEP>0
i enjoyed this film it was funny cute silly and entertaining had a fine cast and really got hammered by some critics for reasons that i truly dont understand no it wasnt the grapes of wrath or casablanca or even moonstruck but it was an enjoyable filmjulia was excellent playing the psychotic man behind the man the story is a little silly to be sure but it this isnt high drama folks i happened to see a review of the film probably the only good one it got and then ran into it one night when looking for a movie i never heard it was supposed to stink until after i saw it and im glad i saw it eventually bought the vhs tape on the bargain pile and i watch it a couple times a year<SEP>1
having watched 10 minutes of this movie i was bewildered having watched 30 minutes my toes were curling - i simply couldnt believe it: the movie is really awful in fact it is so awful that i had to watch all of it just to be convinced! during this i came to realize that it reminded me of a bunch of danish so-called comedies from the 60s and 70s the pattern is as follows: take one extremely popular comedian make a script putting this comedian in as many grotesque situations as possible add a bunch of jokes especially one-liners and spice it up with a couple of beautiful young girls - film that and you have a success! i wouldnt know if this movie was a success but unlike the danish tradition which died quietly with a few great comedians it seems that there is a market for this kind of movie in the us<SEP>0
watching this film for the action is rather a waste of time because the figureheads on the ships act better than the humans its a mercy that anthony quinn couldnt persuade anyone else to let him direct any other films after this turkeybut it is filled with amusement value since yul brynner has hair lorne greene displays an unconvincing french accent and the rest of the big names strut about in comic-book fashion<SEP>0
[***possible spoilers***] this movies reputation precedes it so it was with anticipation that i sat down to watch it in letterbox on tcm what a major disappointmentthe cast is superb and the production values are first-rate but the characters are without depth the plot is thin and the whole thing goes on too long for a movie that deals with alcoholism family divisions unfaithfulness gambling and sexual repression the movie is curiously flat prosaic lifeless and cliche-ridden one example is the portrayal of frank hirschs unfaithfuness: his rather heavy-handed request to his wife to go upstairs and relax a bit followed by her predictable pleading of a headache leads - even more predictably - to his evening liaison with his secretary hey nancy ive got the blues tonight lets go for a drive all according to well-worn formula we dont feel these are real people but cardboard cutouts acting in a marionette play also the source of the obvious friction between frank and dave hirsch is never really explored or explained daves infatuation with the on-againoff-again gwen is inexplicable in light of her fatuous inability to defecate or get off the pot his subsequent marriage of desperation to the shirley maclaineginny character is from the moment of its being presented to this viewer anyway obviously doomed to fail and it was clear - by the conventions of this type of soap opera - that it could only be resolved by someone being killed the moment the jealous lover started running around with the gun i started a bet with myself as to who - dave or ginny - would get killed the whole thing was phony with a capital p having said that maclaines performance and that of dean martin are the standouts here but on the whole i find the movies interest to be purely that of a period piece of hollywood history<SEP>0
this enjoyable minor noir boasts a top cast and many memorable scenes the big distraction is the complete disregard for authentic accents the spanish characters in the film are played by a frenchman boyer a belgian francen a greek paxinou and a hungarian lorre! and to top it all off bacall is supposed to be an english aristocrat! despite these absurdities the performances are all very good - especially those of paxinou and lorre but the scene in which boyer paxinou and lorre meet and talk in wildly different accents is a real hoot! and i guess seeing as how they were alone that they should actually have been speaking in spanish anyway! it seems pretty weird that the brothers warner couldnt find any spanish speaking actors in los angeles! of course hollywood has often had an any old accent will do policy - my other favorite is greta garbo swedish as mata hari dutch who falls in love with a russian soldier played by a mexican ramon novarro maybe they should have got novarro for confidential agent - he would have been great in boyers role or at least in francens which would have saved greatly on the dark make-up budget<SEP>1
this is an amazing movie from 1936 although the first hour isnt very interesting for the modern viewer the stylish vision of the year 2036 that comes afterwords makes up for it however dont plan on being able to understand all of the dialog - the sound quality and accents its american - but 1930s american make it difficultbasically the story is a sweeping 100 year look at a fictional us town called everytown it spans from 1936 when a war is on the horizon to 2036 when technology leaps forward and creates its own problemsthe first one hour is a bit slow - although its tough to tell what audiences back then would have thought the events suspense and visuals are pretty low-key in todays terms however when it gets to the future its just plain fun to watch the large sets and retro sci-fi look of everything is hard to beatunless you have great listening abilities this movie is hard to listen to i think i understood only 80% of the dialog it could use closed-captioningif youre a sci-fi fan this is one of the genres classics and is a must see well at least after the first hour for the average viewer wait until theres a closed caption version and then watch it if youre comfortable with movies of this time period<SEP>1
yuck i thought it odd that their ancient book on curses was made using a common script font instead of hand written the acting is so apathetic at times and so over-dramatic at other times why would a demonico kill the two suspiciously quiet doctors who helped make him immortal just for the heck of it and is it really necessary to show liliths motorcycle whenever shes out somewhere we get it! you spent a little bit of money to rent some third rate crotch rocket it doesnt mean you have to show it all the time! the faiths lair looks like an old school battlestar galactica set with some last minute changes there is a scene where we are introduced to a few people on a talk show for about 30 seconds before they are killed without apparent reason and without importance everyone is a throwaway character forgettable characters and an even more forgettable plot make this one of the most ill-conceived movies ive seen the scifi channel come out with stay away unless youre into bad movies<SEP>0
for your own good it would be best to disregard any positive reviews concerning this movie this flick stinks now i like at least in theory low budget horror movies but this one makes the worst mistake a low budget flick can make: it takes itself way too seriously and unfortunately thats not its only problemits the story of the murderous beane clan of the british ilses transposed to modern times an interesting premise but there are two things that are immediately perplexing about this film once you start watching it#1- why is the biggest name on the cd box jenna jameson shes a below average looking woman who cant act and she has a minor role answer: shes apparently a well known porn star as you no doubt read in other reviews so i guess this is a cameo appearance for her shes giving the film much needed name recognition it seems her top billing isnt any indication of her talent though its an indication of how untalented the rest of the cast is#2- how can film makers be so stupid to think canada can be passed off as ireland it doesnt even remotely look like ireland and the house that the guestsvictims stay in is this great big north american wood frame edwardian thing they should have skipped the whole beane theme and developed a story that took place in na also if youre going to make a movie that takes place in ireland its probably best to have more than one character with an irish accent and that was a really really really bad irish accent nowthis wouldnt have been so bad if the director wasnt trying to make the next night of the living dead but it seems he was too bad he could have had some fun with it in fact some of the scenes werent far from being unintentionally comedic as they werelike the infamous gutting scene were the woman is chained to the table stripped naked and then sliced open and eviscerated thats funny you ask well in the deleted scene version the mutant killer pulls out mile after mile after mile of intestines its actually funny after awhile and what self respecting cannibal eats intestines anyway do we eat the intestines of cows and chickens heck no we eat hams and ribs and drumsticks oh wellsome of the other cast who were annoying: the whiny creepy howard rosenstein im not sure but i think he was supposed to be cast as a stud in fact hes as big a loser and goof ball as his name would imply which would explain why the character played by the equally annoying gillian leigh fell for himi checked gillian leigh on her link on imdb and apparently its important to know that she graduated high school with honors i cant decide if its more amusing or pathetic to know that only a couple years after graduation the honor student is doing nude soft-core porn scenes in a shower with a guy named howard rosenstein wonder if her former classmates have seen this movie if they have hopefully theyll get the message: avoid this fate! go to college!!! i could go on and on but why if you like gore youll find something redeeming in this flick but not much more<SEP>0
a very young ginger rogers trades quick quips and one liners with rival newspaper reporter lyle talbot in this 1933 murder mystery from poverty row film maker allied productions the movie opens with a wealthy businessman taking a header from the roof garden of a high rise apartment house or was it from a lovers apartment rogers actually has two identities at the films outset that of miss terry the dead victims secretary along with her newspaper byline of pat morgan mistakenly phoning her story directly to ted rand talbot instead of her papers rewrite desk she gets fired for her efforts when her boss learns hes been out scoopedheres a puzzle - its revealed during police inspector russells purnell pratt investigation of harkers death that terrymorgan had been employed as his secretary for three weeks why exactly was that after the fact it would make sense that she was there for a newspaper story but before clues are dropped regarding harkers association with a known mobster conveniently living in the same apartment building but again that association isnt relevant until its all linked up to janitor peterson harvey clark and whos making up all the calling cards with the serpent effecting a hsss with the words you will hear it cut and pasted beneath apparently the hissing sound of a snake was the sound made by the apartment houses radiator system which peterson used to transmit a poisonous gas into the rooms of potential victims such as mrs coby in the apartment below harker but in answer to a question posed to inspector russell about mrs cobys death he replied apparently to the cause of strangulationits these rather conflicting plot points that made the movie somewhat unsatisfying for me the revelation of janitor peterson as the bad guy of this piece comes under somewhat gruesome circumstances as we see him stuff the unconscious body of miss morgan in the buildings incinerator furnace! however and score another point against continuity we see miss morgan in a huge basement room as peterson ignites the furnace; she made her getaway but how and still pretty as a picture and who gets to make the collar off screen if none other than milquetoast police assistant wilfred arthur hoyt who in an opening scene fell over his own feet entering a roomsorry but for all those reviewers who found a shriek in the night to be a satisfying whodunit i feel that any charlie chan film of the same era is a veritable the usual suspects by comparison if you need a reason to see the film it would be ginger rogers but be advised she doesnt dance<SEP>0
this is a very good made for tv film it depicts trouble in suburbia circa 1970s and the sort of neighbors one certainly does not want to have around the worst & most upsetting part of the film was when the punk teenagers killed the family dog the teens do everything to annoy and harass this poor family but boy! does the lead character take vengeance on those punk teenagers in the end the fatherhomeowner surely does not take all of the aggravation from the punk teens lightly and is quick to retaliate after lack of help from the police that is he stands up to them and protects his home and his family a very good actori might addi watched this on tv when i was like 8 or 9 i have never seen it again on tv and would like to definitely a good one! its the sort of movie one may catch on a weekday night very late at night and cant stop watching or an afternoon film on a weekend its the kind they just dont show anymoreit is definitely worth seeing!<SEP>1
i did not watch the entire movie i could not watch the entire movie i stopped the dvd after watching for half an hour and i suggest anyone thinking of watching themselves it stop themselves before taking the disc out of the casei like mafia movies both tragic and comic but corky romano can only be described as a tragic attempt at a mafia comedythe problem is corky romano simply tries too hard to get the audience to laugh the plot seems to be an excuse for moving chris kattan corky from one scene to another corky himself is completely overplayed and lacks subtlety or credulity - all his strange mannerisms come across as contrived - chris kattan is clearly acting rather than taking a role - it bounces you right out of the story each scene is utterly predictable the comedic event that will occur on the set is obvious as soon as each scene is introduced in comedies such as mr bean the disasters caused by the title character are funny because you can empathise with the characters motivations and initial event and the situation the character ends up in is not telegraphed corky however gives the feeling that he is deliberately screwing up in a desperate attempt to draw a laugh from the audienceif chris had not played such an alien character who never really connects with the other characters in the movie and whose behaviour is entirely inexplicable except for trying to draw laughs and the comedy scenes werent so predictable and stereotyped - all the jokes seemed far too familiar this movie could have been watchable but it isnt dont watch it<SEP>0
ghost town starts as kate barrett catherine hickland drives along an isolated desert road her car suddenly breaks down & she hears horses hoofs approaching deputy sheriff langley frank luz of riverton county is called in to investigate kates disappearance after her father reports her missing he finds her broken down car & drives off looking for her unfortunately his car breaks down too & he has to walk langley ends up at at a deserted rundown ghost town much to his shock langley soon discovers that it is quite literally a ghost town as its populated by the ghosts of its former residents & is run by the evil devlin jimmie f skaggs who has kidnapped kate for reasons never explained & its up to langley to rescue her & end the towns cursethe one & only directorial effort of richard governor this odd film didnt really do much for me & i didnt like it all that much the script by duke sandefur tries to mix the horror & western genres which it doesnt do to any great effect have you ever wondered why there arent more horror western hybrid films out there well neither have i but if i were to ask myself such a question i would find all the answers in ghost town because its not very good the two genres just dont mix that well there are plenty of clichés on the western side of things theres the innocent townsfolk who are to scared to stand up to a gang of thugs who are terrorising them the shoot-outs in the main street saloon bars with swing doors & prostitutes upstairs & horror wise theres plenty of cobwebs some ghosts an ancient curse talking corpses & a few violent kills i was just very underwhelmed by it i suppose theres nothing terribly wrong with it other than its just dull & the two genres dont sit together that well there are a few holes in the plot too why did devlin kidnap kate i know she resembled his previous girlfriend but how did he know that & what was he going to do with her anyway we never know why this ghost town is full of ghosts either i mean whats keeping them there & what caused them to come back as ghosts then theres the bit at the end where devlin after being shot says he cant be killed only for langley to kill him a few seconds later i mean why didnt the bullets work in the first placedirector governor does alright theres a nice horror film atmosphere with some well lit cobweb strewn sets & the standard hollywood western town is represented here with a central street with wooden buildings lining either side of it i wouldnt say its scary because it isnt theres not much tension either & the film drags in places despite being only just over 80 odd minutes in length forget about any gore there a few bloody gunshot wounds an after the fact shot of two people with their throats slit & someone is impaled with a metal pole & thats itid have imagined the budget was pretty small here its reasonably well made & is competent if nothing else credit where credits due the period costumes & sets are pretty good actually the acting is alright but no-ones going to win any awardsghost town is a strange film im not really sure who its meant to appeal to & it certainly didnt appeal to me anyone looking for a western will be annoyed with the dumb horror elements while anyone looking for a horror film will be bored by the western elements its something a bit different but that doesnt mean its any good worth a watch if your desperate but dont bust a gut to see it<SEP>0
i have not read the other comments on the film but judging from the average rating i can see that they are unlikely to be very complementaryi watched it for the second time with my children they absolutely loved it true it did not have the adults rolling around the floor but the sound of the childrens enjoyment made it seem soit is a true mel brooks farce with plenty of moral content - how sad it is to be loved for our money not for whom we are and how fickle are our friends and associates there are many other films on a similar subject matter no doubt many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults its hard for me to imagine such an impact on the junior members of the family howeverhence for the children a 910 from me<SEP>1
i had a lot of hopes for this movie and so watched it with a lot of expectations; basically because of kamal hassan he is an amazing actor who has marked his foot steps in the sands of time forever but this movie proved to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen after watching this the movie the brutality and violence in tenebra and clockwork orange looks far better the protagonist raghavan is a very daring police officer who is assigned to a investigate brutal serial murders raghavan efficiently finds the connecting thread in this case and is close to solve the murders and put the psycho killers two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students behind bars but they escape and again get into a killing spree finally raghavan kills them both after sparing many innocent livesthese two psycho-killers are the ones who are going to keep the audiences from going to the theaters the murders and sexual harassments and rapes are shown very explicitly which the movie could have survived without to even imagine that teenagers and kids are going to be watching this movie in the theater and kind of picture it is bound to paint in their minds are certainly not pretty the director gautham should realize that he also has some obligation to the society and his audiencecertainly i am never going to the movies looking like gauthams name on the production list<SEP>0
this show is totally worth watching it has the best cast of talent i have seen in a very long time the premise of the show is unique and fresh i guess the executives at abc are not used too that as it was not another reality show however this show was believable with likable characters and marvelous story lines i am probably not in the age group they expect to like the show as i am in my fortys but a lot of my friends also loved it late 30s - mid 40s and are dying for quality shows with talented cast members i do not think this show was given enough time to gain an audience i believe that given more time this show would have done very well once again abc is not giving a show with real potential a real chance with so many shows given chance after chance and not nearly worth it! they need to give quality shows a real chance and the time to really click and gain an audience i really loved the characters and looked forward to watching each episode i have been watching the episodes on abc videos and the show keeps getting better and better although i think they owe us one more episode number 13 we want to watch what we can! bombard abc with emails and letters and see if its possible to save this show from extinction it certainly worked for jerico some things are just worth saving and this show is definitely one of them sign the online petition to abc at: http:wwwpetitiononlinecomgh1215petitionhtml<SEP>1
when people ask me whats the worst movie ive ever seen its this one its not even close to mst3k level riffing or midnight viewing at a theatre or even as disney channel late night filler the only time ive ever wanted to jump off a ride at disney world or disneymgm studios in this case was to grab dick traceys jacket off the mannequin rip it to shreds and ram it down the tour guides throat saying eat this! eat this unholy coat of darkness!!! ive never been so mad at a movie not even nutty professor ii: the klumps or flash gordon you want pretty colors and cinematography aint here babe reviewers keep saying oh but its too look like a comic book well to me its the color of a gordito after several weeks in the sun about as enjoyable too beatty wanders around this landscape jumping around and talking to his watch himself and occasional at the other actors hoping someone will tell him what time the sequel will begin shooting to be fair i have only seen this movie once but my pain threshold is that of a man not a god<SEP>0
the melting mana tragic victim of the space race he perished meltingnever comprehending the race had long gone by!a man burr debenning burns his hand on the kitchen stove but instead of screaming something a normal person would scream he shouts something that sounds like aaaaatch-kah!! this movie youve popped inisnt a normal movie youve just taken your first step into the incredible melting man the famous late-70s gore film featuring rick bakers wonderful makeup effects baker was just on the edge of becoming a superstar and did this at the same time as his famous cantina aliens in star wars for some strange reason star wars became a household name and incredible melting man did not it might have something to do with the fact that this movie is just mind-numbingly awful from the opening credits starring alex rebar as the incredible melting manthats really what it says! to the chubby nurse running through a glass door to the fishermans head going over a waterfall and smashing graphically apart on some rocks this film provides many many moments of sheer incomprehensibility why did theybut how come hewhy are they after a while you give up wondering why and watch it as what it is--a very entertaining piece of garbagean astronaut returns to earth in a melting radioactive condition; he escapes and his mind disintegrating as well as his body begins a mad melting killing spree the authorities quickly decide that the melting man must be stopped but probably not wanting to cause a panic want him captured as quietly as possible so they send one guy with a geiger counter after him wowstorywise surprisingly little happens during the movie the melting guy wanders around killing people a doctor searches for him with a geiger counter various characters are introduced ask questions and leave eventually the doctor catches up with the melting man but is shot by a security guard for no reason after he explains that hes dr ted nelson the melting man wanders off and finally dissolves into a big puddle of goo the endits so brainless that it somehow ends up being a lot of fun despite a fairly downbeat ending supposedly a widescreen dvd release is planned a very special movie<SEP>1
i must admit im a little surprised and disappointed at some of the very negative comments this film seems to provoke i think its a great horrorsci fi film colonel steve west alex rebar returns to earth after an historical space flight to saturn while in space he contracted some bizarre and unknown disease he wakes up in a hospital bed he looks in a mirror and before his very eyes his face is melting! escaping the hospitals supervision he hides out in some local woods surrounding a small town unfortunately he starts to develop a rapidly growing hunger that can only be satisfied by eating other people he must feed on human flesh and drink the blood of others to survive! stalking human prey he begins his reign of terror! its up to his old friend dr ted nelson burr debenning to find him and try and help him he has to work alone as his boss general perry myron healey wants it kept ultra quiet nelson cant even tell his wife judy ann sweeny however sheriff blake micheal alldredge becomes suspicious as general perry turns up just as some of the local townspeople start turning up half eaten i dont really understand why this film gets such negative reviews what do people expect anyway i really like this film the star of the film are unquestionably rick bakers special make-up and gore effects which for the most part are excellent and the fact their all prosthetic effects and no rubbish horrible cgi makes them even better writer and director william sachs isnt afraid to use them either we get some nice long lingering close up shots of the incredible melting man and they hold up very well even now photography music and direction are a little bit dull but professional enough the script manages to create some sympathy for the the monster shots of him looking longingly into ted nelsons house or when he sees his own reflection in some water and reacts violently the ending set in a large factory of some sort is pretty downbeat so dont expect any happy ending which surprised me also the script doesnt really do anything with the premise he just walks around melting and killing with his friend trying to stop him maybe a bit too simple personally i think the worst bit of the film is near the start when the fat nurse runs down a hospital corridor in slow motion her screams are also portrayed in slow motion too it looks and sounds totally ridiculous! you need to see it to believe it! i like this film a lot and recommend it to 70s and 80s horrorsci fi fans a bit of a favourite of mine<SEP>1
in europe its known as who dares wins; in america its known as the final option but under any title this ludicrous sas action flick asks the audience to put their disbelief to one side for around two hours i find it incredibly hard to comprehend how lewis collins the hero here was almost chosen as roger moores successor in the bond films this guy is so expressionless hed struggle to get a job in a waxwork museum as a waxwork!!! luckily judy davis is on hand to partially redeem the affair with a meaty performance as a hard-line lady terrorist and theres a climactic ten minute action sequence that is quite competently orchestrated by director ian sharp let it be added that its a very very very long wait for these closing excitements to come around and i cant honestly say that a near two hour wait for a bit of decent action was worth the effortsas hard man peter skellen lewis collins goes undercover among a group of peace protesters who would like to see the end of nuclear weapons stock-piling he meets their leader frankie judy davis a strong-talking and opinionated woman who might just be capable of taking extraordinary measures to achieve her goals frankies dedicated bunch violently lay siege to the american embassy in london demanding that a nuclear missile be fired at a naval base in scotland she believes that when the world witnesses a nuclear blast for real everyone will be so appalled that they will join her campaign for disarmament unfortunately for frankie she makes the mistake of taking skellen on her little embassy raid and he plans to thwart their plan from inside with a little well-timed outside help from his sas comradesthe film is inspired - quite obviously - by the awesome sas assault on the iranian embassy in 1981 someone who saw that event on the news apparently thought it would be good to devise a film along similar lines unfortunately the film is rather banal with too much stupid dialogue and a heck of a lot of embarrassingly bad scenes the arch-bishops debate which descends into a riot anyone frankies idea to bring about peace by instigating a nuclear blast is ridiculous anyway so she becomes a laughable figure just when the audience is on the verge of viewing her as an interesting villain who dares wins tries to be a celebration of the military legend that is the sas but at the same time it dips into clumsy action clichés and ill-thought-out plotting the result is a well-intentioned but wholly ineffective slice of boys own absurdity<SEP>0
i saw this directors woman on the beach and could not understand the good to great reviews this film is much like that one two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest to anyone else like his other films you have to want to listen to vacuous dialog wade through very little and become enchanted with underwritten pretty uninteresting characters if you feel you can like this film dont let my review stop you i do like minimalism in films but i feel tsai ming-liangs films are far superior he has a fairly terrific actor in lee kang-sheng in his films there is nothing here i wish iu liked it but i dont oh well<SEP>0
after viewing whipped at a distributors screening at the afm the other night i have to say that i was thoroughly impressed the audience was laughing all the way through unfortunately every territory was already sold so i did not have the opportunity to purchase the film but i truly believe that it will be a big hit both domestically and over seas i agree with the comment that whipped should not be pitched as a male sex and the city mainly because unlike sex and the city whipped is a satire about dating that never takes itself too seriously whipped pokes fun at relationships in a way that most sex comedies wouldnt dare also the film that i screened at the afm had more of a plot and story than swingers clerks and sex and the city combined whipped never slowed down for a beat and provided the audience with non-stop comedy the performances of amanda peet and the rest of the cast were all rock solid which only made the film more impressive considering the budget<SEP>1
although i didnt like stanley & iris tremendously as a film i did admire the acting jane fonda and robert de niro are great in this movie i havent always been a fan of fondas work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time de niro has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold he gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he cant care for him anymore that will break your heart i wouldnt really recommend this film as a great cinematic entertainment but i will say you wont see much bette acting anywhere<SEP>1

this wonderful 1983 bbc television production not a movie as others have written here of the classic love story jane eyre starring timothy dalton as rochester and zelah clarke as jane is the finest version that has been made to date since it is the most faithful to the novel by charlotte bronte in both concept and dialogue a classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons; when film producers start to meddle with a classics very lifeblood then that classic is destroyed thankfully the producers of this jane eyre approached the story with respect and faithfulness towards the original which results in a spectacularly addictive concoction that is worth viewing multiple times to enjoy its multi-layers of sweetness and delight and suspense the performances are delightful the music is just right even the gothic design of the house and outdoor shots are beautiful and set the right tone for the production my only criticism though slight is that this version like every other version ever made of jane eyre ignores the christian influences that built janes character and influenced her moral choices in todays modern world a woman in janes situation wouldnt think twice but to stay with rochester after finding out he had an insane wife and was still married to her oh just get a divorce she would say to her man or she would live in sin with him but jane eyre knew she couldnt settle for this course in life and respect herself why this decision was based on the foundations of the christian faith she had been taught since childhood not from the brutal calvinist lowood institution but from the christian example of a true friend helen burns who was martyred rather than not turn the other cheek someday i would like to see some version depict these influences a little more fully in an adaptation a classic novel that ends with the heroine writing even so come lord jesus! should not have the foundations of that faith stripped out of it<SEP>1
do you know when you look at your collection of old videotaped movies and realize that there are some that youve only seen once or twice and you cant remember if theyre worth the time it takes to see them the alibi iswas one of those films; i found it not long ago and decided i might as well give it a chance im not entirely sure if im happy with my decision on one hand the film is really really bad on the other now i have another free tape yeah you get it the plot is predictable and not in any way original the pacing is bad the acting is bad but thats not really surprising seeing as the two leads are former soap-opera stars theyre used to overact the characters are poorly written clichés the film even manages to screw up the easiest damn way to impress methrough film: court scenes even those dont elicit one single emotion for or against any of the cardboard-thin characters the film just has no real redeeming qualities whatsoever even the dialog is bad the thing is its so full of clichés that its laughable and thats the one thing that lifts this above a rating of 110: thealbeit unintentionally so comic relief of the many clichés and stereotypes i didnt pay very much attention to the film but just about every time i looked at the screen there was something to laugh at one final note: i considered using the line tori spelling cant act as a one line summary but i guess everyone knows that so i opted for the current one seeing as its more informative all in all a thoroughly bad film but not the worst if youve got nothing else to do and if its on tv good for a few laughs if you can sit through it 310<SEP>0
this movie was absolutely ghastly! i cannot fathom how this movie made it to production nothing against the cast of the movie of course this is all the fault of the writing team you take the old average plot - lets dance our way out of being poor and destitute - or step in this case but this one lacks any semblance of a true plot - or at least one that anyone would care about with canadian speaking actors in what is supposed to be an american setting - this film falls very flat on a positive note the directing was pretty good and cinematography was pretty decent as well looks like the production budget was very generous as well my only request is that this team leave the writing alone and go find actual screenwriters to help them bring words alive on film net result - how she move is how she sucks<SEP>0
i must admit at first i wasnt expecting anything good at all i was only expecting a cheesy movie promoting gackts and hydes image but im glad to say it has much more to offeryes the acting is not that great but it doesnt suck either all the casts well disciplined and they bring enough strength to their characters effects lack consistency but action scenes are satisfying enoughwhat really hooked me up was the essence of the storyline although it merges fantastic elements it also displays a crude reality the developing of the characters their doubts and their feelings really got on to me and i think thats the key of this movie it puts you to think and it does well transmitting all the angstit fulfills any expectations for a good drama i would definitely recommend it to everyone<SEP>1

a true wholesome american story about teenagers who are interested in launching their own rocket in a rural west virginia coal mining town after the launch of sputnik in 1957through trial tribulations and perseverance beyond belief they are ultimately able to achieve their goalsjake gyllenhaal as the leader of the group is excellent in the title role as his motivating science teacher laura linney is quite good but her southern accent is over the topthere is a standout supporting performance by chris cooper a head miner who wants his son to follow in his footsteps but gradually comes around at films endwhat makes this film so unusual for our times is that there are no bed-hopping scenes and no profanity whatsoever it is the epitome of an american story that is well donebesides the science angle we have the father-son disagreement football scholarships as a way to escape coal mining and the loving spirit of familywhy arent pictures like this recognized more at award times<SEP>1
there have been some low moments in my life when i have been bewildered and depressed sitting through rancid aluminium was one of thesethe warning signs were there no premiere even the stars didnt want to attend and no reviews in magazines the only reason i sat through the film was in the hope that i might catch up on some sleepnothing in the film was explained the narration was idiotic i cheered at one point when the lead of the film appeared to have been shot then to my growing despair it was revealed that he hadnt really been shot dampening my joy i sincerely hope all involved in the film are hanged for this atrocity there were some positive aspects mainly unintentional moments of humour for example the scene in which the main character for some unknown reason feels the need to relieve himself manually in a toilet cubicle while telling the person in the next cubicle to put his fingers in his earsmy words cannot explain the anger i feel so i shall conclude thusrancid aluminium: for sadists wastrels and regressives only who want to torture themselves<SEP>0
what begins as a fairly clever farce about a somewhat shady security monitoring company turns almost instantaneously into an uninteresting and completely inane murder mystery david arquette and the great stanley tucci try mightily to make this train wreck watchable but some things are just not humanly possiblewhat for instance causes gale to turn suddenly from a sweet motherly figure into a drunken shrew at tommys parents house why would heinrich although admittedly a sleezebag want to destroy the business to which he devotes his life by robbing and possibly murdering his customers why does the seemingly sensible tommy believe that heinrich could be a murderer based almost entirely on a dream and even if that were believable why wouldnt he go to the police and why didnt gale activate the alarm when she got home especially after scolding howie about it being off of course all of these events are necessary for the plot and i use the term very very loosely to unfold and it might be forgivable if it resulted in even the slightest bit of comedy but everything from howies description of his date rape to the coroners misidentification of gale to the final joke about gale and howie still being dead is more tasteless and pathetic than anything elsei checked the box indicating that my comments contained spoilers but theres nothing more i or anyone else could do to spoil this thing that already stinks to high heaven<SEP>0

currently this film is listed on imdb as the 42nd worst film ever made--which is exactly why i rented it from netflix however i am saddened to report that the film while bad is no where near bad enough to merit being in the bottom 100 films ever made list i have personally seen at least 100 films worse than this one hardly a glowing endorsement but it just didnt meet the expected level of awfulness to be included on this infamous listthe film begin with stewart moss and marianne mcandrew on their belated honeymoon by the way they are married in real life as well hes a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists they go to a nearby cave once there they behave very very very stupidly hallmark of a bad film and are soon bitten by a bat according to this film bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the us--both of which are not true at alloddly after being bitten the man doesnt even bother going to the hospital!! the first thing on anyones mind especially a doctor is to get medical help immediately but not this boob soon hes having seizures--yet he still isnt interested in seeking help! again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history!! after a while he eventually goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital but by then its too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins killing people to suck their blood when its totally obvious to everyone that the man is a crazed killing machine the wife who like her husband has a grapefruit for a brain refuses to believe hes dangerous--even after he attacks people steals an ambulance and runs a police car off the road!! now most of the time moss is going through these episodes his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal person oddly however a couple times he develops bat-like hands and towards the end they used some nice prosthetics on him to make him look quite bat-like had this been really cheesy the film would have merited a 1in the very end in a twist that hardly made any sense at all the wife inexplicably turned into a crazed bat lady and had a swarm of bats kill the evil sheriff how all this was arranged was a mystery as was moss and mcandrews belief that this film would somehow help their careers--though they both have had reasonably long careers on tv playing bit roles since 1974overall very dumb the plot is silly and makes no sense and strongly relies on people acting way too dumb to be real not a good film at all but not among the worst films of all time eithernote: for some reason imdb shows the graphic for the three dvd set for its alive and its two sequels of the web page for the bat people while the bat people has been seen with the title its alive the two movies are not at all related its easy to understand the mistake--especially since they both came out in 1974 but the movie i just reviewed starred stewart moss and marianne mcandrew and the other film starred john ryan and sharon farrell<SEP>0
mark frechette stars as mark a college radical leftist mark is accused of killing a cop during a campus riot and he flees all the way to the desert he does so by stealing a small plane at the local airport and flies it himself once out flying over the desert mark spots a car from the air a young woman named daria steps out and sees mark circling in the plane mark swoops the plane very low several times causing daria to duck or get hit when he lands he becomes acquainted with daria who is strangely charmed by marks aerial highjinks after engaging in soulful conversation for hours mark and daria get naked and make love in the sand but with mark evading the law they realize that he needs to keep running so mark and darias brief tryst is quite poignant because it doesnt get to develop into a full-blown romancezabriski point was the eraserhead of the early 70s both films have a rambling vague quality along with complicated meanings and characters frechette was as reckless in person as his character was in this film a few years after making zabriski point frechette robbed a bank in real life while serving his prison sentence mark died an ignoble death he was killed by a 150 lb weight which fell on him when he was weightlifting the best thing about this movie was the splendid cinematography and special visual effects the incredible slow-motion scenes of debris floating in the air after an explosion were a stroke of genius although not as ground-breaking a film as easy rider was zabriski point still resonated with the early 70s counterculture i recommend it for those who like avant-guard films which showcase the upheaval of the youth rebellion during the early 70s<SEP>1
it was a painful experience the whole story is actually there so i wont go into that but the acting was horrible there is this part in the very beginning when the scientist brother goes to work he actually wears a white coat at home before leaving to work i thought working with biohazard material meant that you should wear sterilized clothes in a controlled environment and the lab itself looks like a school lab there is this monitor on top a file cabinet that has nothing to do with the whole scene its just there to make the place look technical and a scientist is actually having breakfast in the lab and next to him is a biohazard labeled jar and his boss walks in on him and doesnt even tell him anything about itnot to mentioned bad acting very bad cant get any worst than that my advice dont watch and i thought nothing could be worse than house of the dead apparently uwi bolls movies look like classical shakespeare compared to this!<SEP>0
this two-part tv mini-series isnt as good as the original from 1966 but its solid the original benefited from a huge number of things---it was all in black and white it had a great jazz score and it was filmed at the real locations including the home of the doomed clutter family that was important because in the book and in the original movie the home is very much a character itselfthis remake was filmed in canada which i guess doubles okay for kansas the story tries to be as sympathetic to perry as it dares to and eric roberts plays him as a somewhat fey person his homosexuality barely hidden the gentler take by roberts doesnt quite work in the end though because its hard to believe that his version of perry smith would just finally explode in a spasm of murder whereas robert blakes take on smith left you no doubt that his perry smith was an extremely dangerous characteranthony edwards was excellent as the bombastic big-mouthed and ultimately cowardly dick hickcock the brains of the outfit his performance compares very well to scott wilsons role in the original moviesince this is a longer movie it allows more time to develop the clutter family and in this regard i think the 1996 movie has an advantage the clutters are just an outstanding decent family theyve never harmed another soul and it is just inexplicable that such a decent family is ultimately massacred in such a horrifying way it still boggles my mind that after the clutters were locked in the bathroom that herb clutter didnt force out the window so at least his children would have a chance to escape this movie has the thought occur to him but too late from what i read about the real home which is still standing the way the bathroom is configured they couldve opened the counter drawers and effectively barricaded the door which wouldve forced the killers to blast their way in but it mightve bought time for some of the clutters to escape why the clutters didnt try this i have no ideafans of the book will recognize that this movie takes a lot of liberties with how the crime is committed but not too serious still its distracting to viewers like me who have read tons about the case the actors playing the cops led by sam neill and leo rossi are uniformly excellent much better i think as a group than the actors in the original movie they know that to secure the noose around the necks of both of them they have to get them to confess and the officers come to the interview impeccably prepared they had already discovered the likely alibi the phony story of going to fort scott and had debunked every jot of it the officers then let smith & hickcock just walk into their trap hickcock is a bs artist who figures he can convince anyone of anything and the officers respectfully let him tell his cover story but when they lower the boom on him he shatters very quickly its very well filmed and acted and very gratifying to watch because the viewer naturally should loath hickcock in particular by this point a cowardly con-man who needs the easily manipulated smith to do his killing for him supposedly hickcock later stated that the real reason for the crime wasnt to steal money from the clutters but to rape nancy clutter at least she was spared that degradationthe actors playing the clutters are very good kevin tighe as herb clutter in particular the story sensitively deals with mrs clutters emotional problems most likely clinical depression and mrs clutter displays remarkable inner strength when she firmly and strongly demands that the killers leave her daughter alone from what ive read the clutters surviving family was particularly bothered by how bonnie clutter was portrayed in the book claiming it was entirely untrue but as an aside both of the killers related to the police how mr clutter asked them to not bother his wife because of her long illness capote might make up that fiction to make the character of bonnie more interesting but certainly the killers had no reason to falsely portray mrs clutter and no doubt much of the conversation in the book duplicated in the movies is right off the taped confessions of the killers so it wouldve been nonsensical for herb to have said that and not have it be true<SEP>1
this movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that ive spent in a very very long time if you knew how often i went to the movies youd probably say thats hard to imagine but never-the-less its true! after seeing the trailer for this movie i knew that i had to see it! if youre a fan of horror mystery and suspense why wouldnt you the trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting; unfortunately the movie is none of thesefrom the cinematography to the script to the acting this movie is a complete flop if youre reading this planning to go to the movie expecting some thrills mystery action horror or anything other than a waste of an hour and forty-five minutes im afraid you are in for disappointmentwhy is it so bad you might be asking yourself let me tell you the movie was neither mysterious nor suspenseful nothing about the movie made me the least bit on edge frightened or curious the script was at best laughable there were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous i began to write it off as comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it wasnt the acting was absolutely dreadful i like nicholas cage but this was a miss without exception every performance in this movie was incredibly below average the cinematography was awful with not one moment of suspense or mystique finally the story is completely transparent you can see the end of this movie coming a mile awayi am not usually a very harsh critic frankly when i go to see a comedy i want to laugh and when i go to see a mysterysuspensehorror i just want to be surprised this movie was boring poorly acted poorly written and an overwhelming disappointment do yourself a favor and go see something else<SEP>0
i cherish each and every frame of this beautiful movie it is about regular people people we all know who suffer a little in their life and have some baggage to carry around just like all of us robert deniro ed harris and kathy baker breathe life into their portrayals and are all excellent but harris is especially heartbreaking and therefore very real you would swear he really is a trucker who drinks so he wont have to feel anything baker as his put-upon sister also has some delicate moments - when deniro gives her flowers in one scene it seems like she was never given flowers before and probably wasnt very worthwhile<SEP>1
im so glad i happened to see this video at the store i was looking for some happy movies and this one turned out to be a true gem i loved that the movie a love story of sorts wasnt about some beautiful twenty-somethings; rather its a story of some beautiful sixty-somethings who used used to be twenty-somethings its a good well written and wonderfully acted story with fabulous wwii band music thrown in as well its also got a delightful surprise in it for scottish castle lovers it left me smiling and ready to watch it again which i did a couple more times before i turned it in i highly recommend it<SEP>1
it surprises me that i actually got the courage to watch the bio flick or flicks che: parts 1 & 2 why because if my cuban exile parents would ever found out i saw this movie about this despicable mass murderer of the cuban revolution i would be grounded for life hey wait i am an adult they cant ground me no mas director steven soderbergh and newbie commie sorry steven but i had to take soder shots here divides the movie in two partes on commander ernesto che guevaras revolutionary life che: part 1 presents how che in the mid 1950s joined fidel castros guerilla crew in their revolutionary quest to overthrow cuban president fulgencio batistas regime; which as we all know was a revolutionary success for them but a gargantuan guerilla disaster to many cubans as it revolted into communism che: part 2 presents che trying to revolutionize the t-shirt industry by pitching t-shirts with his appalling bearbado face to t-shirt manufacturers ok i am che-chatting a lot of crap towards your way! i meant to say the che: part 2 focuses on che in the late 60s trying to bring back the revolution this time to a poverty-stricken bolivia but with far different results in fact che ended up being dead meat enchelada when he was captured and killed by the bolivian militia in 1967 soderbergh does not include the in-between time of those two instances in ches life when he commanded the despicable la cabana fortress prison in cuba where he mass murdered many cubans who opposed communism that is where i think soderbergh executed a cinematic injustice by not showing the viewers how atrocious guevara really was i did decide to see che in hopes that soderbergh would not glamorize him but instead present how disturbed he really was unfortunately soderbergh did not do the latter and sadly decided to present guevara as a revolutionary hero which he was not he was a sick man who thank god is now probably at the bottom of the devil barrel now i do have to be an objectivistic reviewer and must admit that benicio del toros performance as che was extremely commanding and worthy of merit and that demian bichir was a haunting dead-ringer as fidel castro in his meticulous performance but the rest of the cast of che was primarily comprised of mediocre performances of actors portraying guerilla soldiers and as much as i do admire matt damon why did sodebergh throw him in the revolutionary mix in a spanish-speaking cameo performance portraying a bolivian delegate soderbergh did not have to present this biopic which is mostly too much talk and not enough action in 4 hours and 30 minutes we have had too much of che already even posthumously with those ridiculous t-shirts so why give us too much more of him but i guess when you have the del toro by the horns as you did here steven i guess it is your saving grace for not totally executing che: parts 1 &2 *** average<SEP>1
man the ending of this film is so terribly unwatchable and dated that my entire film aesthetics class laughed like crazy now most of the rest of the film was okay it had a few unintentionally funny scenes but had a few real good camera shots and editing yes alderich is a great director who made flight of the phoenix and whatever happened to baby jane among others the problem isnt with direction acting or anything technical the movie is just destroyed in the third act why the murders twists turns and characters have all been revolving around nuclear material what the heck was the writer smoking when he came up with that the way it just comes out of nowhere may have been the biggest deus ex machina in history for all the complaints about burtons planet of the apes the life of david gale or notorious i think this is the worst ending ever what a let down<SEP>0
baba - rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life this is the movie which caused his downfall it was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the losses incurred soon after its release he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably its a very bad movie with horrible acting bad-quality makeup and pathetic screenplay throughout the movie rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease im one of the unfortunate souls who saw baba first day first show in theatre the audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission sorry ill not recommend this one to anyone<SEP>0
dennis hopper and jt walsh steal the show here cage and boyle are fine but what gives this neo-noir its juice is hoppers creepy violent character and jt walshs sneakinessa drifter gets mistaken for a hit-man and tries to make a little dough out of it but gets in over his headi found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie when cage walks into a trailer in wyoming to get drilling work with the help of his buddyand the opening scene in brokeback mountain when the character does the same thing! but thats another storydennis hopper is at his best herecocky one-step-ahead villainous seething and explosively violent jt walsh rip is also great as the man with a dark past trying to live legitimately well almostthere are only 4 real characters of note here with the exception of the hard-working deputy in the town of red rock wyoming the first twist hits early on and from there its a nice neo-noir adventure in some sleepy little town satisfying 8 pts<SEP>1
the message of this movie is personality is more important than beauty jeanine garofalo is supposed to be the ugly duckling but the funny thing is that shes not at all ugly actually shes a lot more attractive than uma thurman the friend who looks like a modelnow would this movie work if the ugly duckling was really unattractive when will hollywood stop with this hypocrisyin my opinion despite the message that it wants to convey this movie is simply ridiculous<SEP>0
i loved this movie first because it is a family movie second because it offers a refreshing take on dealing with the news of hiv in a family with far less hysteria than what i have normally seen in the movies the brothers are very close yet are not judgmental their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble but not needed in the end i understand that leos choice on how to deal with his treatment may not have been the most popular one with people but i believed it was the right choice for him i cant believe that this was a french television programme it had great production values i gave this movie a ten and i think you will too once you have seen it<SEP>1
this week i just thought it would be fun to catch up with corey haim with just having seen the two lost boys films last week and all not that im a fan-boy - not by far - but i did like those two coreys in some films back in my early teen daysso i prepared myself for three films starring him unfortunately i picked dream machine as a first never seen it before and it was so godawfully horrible i just decided to lock corey back in my closet and let him sober up again first before i pop in something else of his but i managed to struggle my way through this film first i had the impression it desperately wanted to play in the same league as ferris buellers day off 1986 but got caught up in its own delusions practically the whole film it wants to be a comedy and near the end it hopelessly tries to be a thriller the only good thing about dream machine is the premise: a dead body in the trunk of a porsche all the rest fails so badly its embarrassing even the most for haim i can dig him being his young enthusiastic self but at least when he comes with some form of directorial guidelines this clearly wasnt the case in dream machine so we have a perfect car yes that black porsche haims perfect girlfriend just a blonde chick who hardly has any lines in the film the perfect murder almost some dude that falls flat on his ass as the villain of the film trying the whole movie to steal the body back out of the trunk never really succeeds and then at the end of the film thinks hes michael myers minus the white william shatner mask and mistakes corey haim for jamie lee curtis dont think they could have made this flick any lamer if they tried a stupid unfunny film with a story that leads to nowhere directed by a director that doesnt know how to direct his cast great accomplishment!one last question for mr haim: whos idea was it to have you smile directly into the camera in that last shot of the movie yours or the directors so not done<SEP>0
by all the fawning people have been doing over miike and his work i sat through this flick tonight i figured if its half as good as ringu as i assumed from these comments it might be than it will be worth my timeno such luckim all for finding the next great director or writer but i dont think miike is the one i dont have an nyu masters of fine arts but i do know this much: a horror movie has to have pacing it also has to give the viewer more credulity than this movie doesthis films pacing had me shaking my head some of the scenes near the end dragged so badly i went to the fridge and lingered there while kou shibasaki stared at the camera for seemingly minutes on end eyes wide and mouth agape a famous director once made the claim and im paraphrasing a movie could be made by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and letting it roll kou is not a good enough actress to make that work she stares paralyzed at the undead girl for more scenes than i care to remember and she isnt the only one doing an impersonation of a deer in headlights; other cast members apparently feel the need to imitate this non-performance the script gives them little room to do much else for far too much of the timei like asian cinema hong kong action flicks from the last 30 years korean horror like phone and koma ang lees work some of the trashy but fun filipino movies with gratuitous sex and fighting as well as others chakushin ari i could have done without<SEP>0

man was i disappointed1 adam arkin is more whiny than ross geller from friends 2 a great cast is wasted kenneth mars alan arkin ed mcmahon pat morita louis nye with this amateurish script3 the movie suffers from horrible pacing it jumps around through in a jumbled confusing manner4 the story doesnt even make sense why does he want to break the football streak what about the stupid violin music none of it is explained5 its not even funny its like a bunch of accountants trying to do improv saying lookit me! lookit me im being funny! this was a bad attempt at making another love at first bitei like larry cohen movies but man he failed here i couldnt wait for the credits to roll horribly disappointed<SEP>0
a glacier slide inside a cavernous ice mountain sends its three characters whoosh down a never-ending wet-slide tube that has enough kick to dazzle kids the same way mature audience may be dazzled by the star gate sequence that closes 2001: a space odyssey miles apart in vision but it is a scene of great rush and excitement nonetheless a magnificent opening sequence also takes place where a furry squirrel-like critter attempts to hide his precious acorn youve probably seen this scene in the trailer but as it takes place he starts a domino effect when the mountain starts cracking and results an avalanche the horror just keeps going as the critter tries to outrun the impossible the movie traces two characters a mammoth named manfred ray romano and a buck-toothed sloth john leguizamo as they try to migrate south they find a human baby they adopt and then decide to track the parent figures down to return to them they are joined by a saber tiger named diego denis leary whose predatory intentions is to bring the baby to his tiger clan by leading the mammoth and the sloth into a trap diegos meat-eating family wants the mammoth most of all but diegos learned values of friendship make easy what choice to ultimately make at the end there are fatalistic natural dangers of the world along the trip including an erupted volcano and a glacier bridge that threatens to melt momentarily that is reminiscent of the castle escape in shrek characters contemplate on why theyre in the ice age while they could have called it the big chill or the nippy era some characters wish for a forthcoming global warming another great line about the mating issues between girlfriends: `all the great guys are never around the sensitive ones get eaten throwaway lines galore whimsical comedy and light-fingered adventure makes this one pretty easy to watch also food is so scarce for the nice vegetarians that they consider dandelions and pine cones as `good eating the vocal talents of romano leguizamo and leary make good on their personas while the children will delight in their antics the adults will fancy their riffs on their own talents there is some mild violence and intense content but kids will be jazzed by the excitement and will get one of their early introductions of the age-old battle of good versus evil and family tradition and friendship are strong thematic ties the animators also make majestic use of background landscapes that are coolly fantastic<SEP>1
freeway killer is a madman who shoots people on the freeway while yelling a bunch of mystical chant on a car phone the police believe he is a random killer but sunny the blond heroine played by darlanne fluegel detects a pattern so does the ex-cop played by james russo and they join forces and bodies in the search for the villain who has done away with their spouses also starring richard belzer this movie has its moments especially if you like car chases but its really not a good movie for the most part check it out if youre really bored and have already seen the hitcher joy ride or breakdown otherwise stay away from the freeway<SEP>0
this movie features an ok score and a not bad performance by david muir as dr hackenstein the beginning and end credits show along with the most of the actors and the special effects that this is a low budget movie there is nothing in this movie that you could not find in other mad scientist horrorcomedy or low budget movies not special for any nude scene buffs or bad movie lovers either this movie is simply here anne ramsey and phillis diller are nothing to get excited about as well if you are curious as i was and can actually find this you will realize the truth of the one line summary<SEP>0
i love the book jane eyre and have seen many versions of it all have their strong points and their faults however this was one of the worst i have seen i didnt care about jane or mr rochester charlotte gainsbourg jane was almost tolerable and certainly looked the plain part but she had no emotion in any of her lines i couldnt imagine what mr rochester saw in her that brings us to mr rochester william hurt had even less emotion than jane if that were possible how two such insipid people could fall in love is a mystery but it certainly didnt hold my attention perhaps the director zeffrelli fell asleep during the productionthe timothy dalton too handsome for mr rochester! version is far more faithful to the book but ciaran hinds plays the perfect mr rochester in the 1997 ae version which is not all that true to the booktrying to find something positive about this movie: geraldine chaplain was perfect in her role<SEP>0
im not a regular viewer of springers but i do watch his show in glimpses and i think the show is a fine guilty pleasure and a good way to kill some time so naturally im going to watch this movie expecting to see jerry springer uncensored first of all jerry appears in approximately twenty minutes of the films running time the other hour and twenty minutes is spent building up this pseudo-farce about trailer-trash jealousy incest and deception jaime pressley who looks hot as hellll is a trailer-trash slut who sleeps with her stepfather a very unusual-looking chain-smoking drunken michael dudikoff who finally strays from his action hero persona the mom finds out about the affair they get into a fight they want to take it to the jerry show thats right no springer and then we have a parallel story with an african-american couple they take it to the jerry show the characters collide blah blah freakin blah! trash has rarely been this borrringg!!!! i was wondering why the hell springer has millions of fans yet none of them checked out his movie well now its totally obvious!! whether you love him or hate him you will hate this movie! how can i explain its a total mess of a motion picture if thats what you call it its so badly edited with scenes that just dont connect and after a period of time the plot virtually disappears and its simply all over the map! just imagine a predictable soap opera transformed into a comic farce with seldom laughs my only positive note is a hot girl-girl scene thats as risque as it gets dont get me wrong the scenes pretty risque but if you look at the overall film comparing it to the material on springers program--this disastrous farce seems extremely sanitizedmy score: 3 out of 10<SEP>0
this is a fair little show about the paranormal although it feels as if art bell and his ilk figured out how to carve a career out of the attitude that carl kolchak exemplified of course there probably wouldnt be an x-files if this show hadnt prepped this audience for it so well darren mcgavin is not exactly the super-heroic type but he is a plausibleenough guy to deliver heroic deeds check out his work on some of those old alfred hitchcock presents here he is the main attraction there doesnt seem to be a girlfriend or wife whos a distraction in fact there isnt a whole lot of sex appeal to the show something im noticing as well is that the pacing isnt really suspenseful in a typical way theres a lot of throwaway humor to this show sometimes its just pokey to get to the climax theres a thread from this show coming all the way up to the present mad men show in terms of style not that david chase writes mad men but the people that worked under him on the sopranos definitely have emulated and inherited his serio-comic tone<SEP>0
this film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in california she thought it was wonderful because it was so real just the way people in the ohio valley are! im from the area and i experienced the film as just the way people in california think we are! ive lived in marietta and parkersburg and worked minimum wage jobs there we laughed a lot we bonded with and took breaks with people our own age; the young people went out together at night the older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families the area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere elseaside from the if you live in a manufactured home you must be depressed condescension the story lacked any elements of charm mystery or even a sense of dreadmarthas character was the worst drawn its doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church but if she had she probably would have made friends there ive read reviews that seem to assume martha was jealous of rose because rose was younger prettier and thinner but if this is the case it isnt shown all we actually see is martha learning to dislike rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender we see martha feeling left out during smoking sessions left out of the loop when social plans are made used but not appreciated and finally disrespected and hurtjust one more thing: are we supposed to suspect kyle of murder because he had once had a few panic attacks please this takes stigma against mental illness to a new level<SEP>0
the word classic is thrown around too loosely nowadays but this movie well deserves the appelation the combination of neil simon walter matthau possibly the worlds best living comic actor and the late lamented george burns make for a comic masterpiece it is interesting to contemplate what the movie would have been like had not death prevented jack benny from playing george burns part as had been planned as it is the reunion scene in matthaus apartment is not likely to be surpassed as a sidesplitter definitely one of my desert island filmsenter!!!!!!!!!<SEP>1
the horror channel plays nothing but erotic soft porn gothic flicks each night from 10pm till about 4 in the morning but their scare factor is very limited if one exists at all in fact i am sure i will find a multi-million pound lottery win more scary than anything this channel has to offerthe bloodsucker leads the dance deserves special mention because it is i feel the undisputed low of a channel full of lows i cannot even begin to tell you how bad this film is but for the purpose of completing the minimum 10 lines demanded by this site i will at least give it a gofirstly the title is misleading and bears no resemblance to the action on the screen in fact the film might as well have been called toothbrush or wallpaper for all it has to do with the plot at least they used toothbrushesat least they had wallpaperthere are no bloodsuckers for miles around and whats even worse there are no dances not one im sure they were making two different films by mistake herea more suitable title would have been horny italian count leads five people to a scary castle and bores us silly for ninety minutes yes that fits betterthe acting is terrible and and the dubbing appalling and that guy who plays seymour was almost as wooden in his walk as he was in his characterabysmalthe only saving graces of this film are a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene two small and very interesting heterosexual sex scenes and the added attraction in that every single female character gets her kit off bonusotherwise steer a wide birth away from this one no vampires no dancing no scenes of a brutal or gruesome nature and no way on gods earth i will ever ever ever watch this one againno word of a lie this film could put you off motion pictures for life<SEP>0

remember when harrison ford was the biggest star in hollywood because he made great movies those days are feeling like a more and more distant memorywhile hollywood homicide is by no means terrible it is a routine and surprisingly boring buddy cop movie its a comedy thats not particularly funny and an action movie thats not especially exciting an overabundance of subplots cannot mask the weakest of the central storylineford at least appears to be enjoying himself more than is his last few projects and he is able to carry the film most of the time hartnett is adequate but he and ford arent exactly newman and redford as far as chemistry is concernedall in all hollywood homicide is a reasonably amusing diversion but just barely take out ford and its not even that<SEP>0
i wanted so much to enjoy this movie it moved very slowly and was just boring if it had been on tv it would have lasted 15 to 20 minutes maybe what happened to the story a great cast and photographer were working on a faulty foundation if this is loosely based on the life of the director why didnt he get someone to see that the writing itself was loose then he directed it at a snails pace which may have been the source of a few people nodding off during the movie the music soars but for a different film not this onefor soap opera saga possibly there were times when the dialogue was not understandable when armin meuller stahl was speaking i was not alone because i heard a few rumblings about who said what to whom why cant hollywood make better movies this one had the nugget of a great story but was just poorly executed<SEP>0
this movie is a touching story about an adventure taken by 15-year-old darius weems darius has duchenne muscular dystrophy a still un-curable disease that took the life of his brother at age nineteen and is the number one killer of babies in the united states him and a few close friends travel across the country to los angeles with the goal of getting his wheelchair customized on mtvs pimp my ride one of his favorite shows the journey begins in georgia where darius grew up and has never left the gang head west for a trip that all its participants will never forget darius gets to ride in a boat for the first time ride in a hot air balloon swim in the ocean and visit sights hes always wanted to see like the grand canyon and new orleans the filmmakers here clearly have an emotional connection to the material they make no money from sales of the $20 dvds $17 goes toward researching the disease and $3 goes toward making more copies the film has won over 25 awards at festivals and i agree with the quote given to the film by variety certain to stir hearts<SEP>1
wrestlemania 14 is not often looked as one of the great wrestlemanias but i would personally put it in my top 5 if not the top 3 it has so many great things and it truly signified the birth of the attitude era which was wwes best era in my opinion hbk has the heart of a lion and him putting over austin like he did on his way out was pure class on his part it has one of the hottest crowds you will ever see and it has jr and the king at their announcing best! matches15  team battle royal loud pop for lods return im not a fan of battle royals and this is yet another average one very predictable even when you 1st see it its obvious lod would win looking at sunny for 8 or so minutes though definitely helps 25wwf light heavyweight championshiptaka michinoku|c| vs aguilataka gets a surprising pop with his entrance fast high-flying and very exciting if these two had more time they would have surely tore the roof off with their stuff taka wins with the michinoku driver3 12 5wwf european championshiptriple h|c| vs owen hart stipulation here is chyna is handcuffed to slaughter nice pop for owen mixed reaction for trips a really really underrated match that ranks among one of my favorites for wrestlemania actually the two mixed together very well and owen can go with anybody trips wins with chyna interference45mixed tag match marc mero&sable vs goldust&luna defining pop for sable unheard of that time for woman sable actually looks hot and the crowd is just eating her up! constant sable chants and them erupting almost every time she gets in the ring not bad for a mixed tag match it had entertaining antics and passed the time well sables team wins when sable hits the tko2 12 5wwf intercontinental championship ken shamrock vs the rock|c| before i review the match id like to note the rock showed off his immense potential with his interview with jennifer flowers before his match nice pop for shamrock big time heat for the rock too disappointingly short and i thought the ending was kinda stupid though shamrocks snapping antics were awesome to see and the crowd went nuts for it rock keeps the title when the ref reverses the decision25dumpster match for the wwf tag team championshipcatcus jack&terry funk vs the new age outlaws the outlaws are not as over as they were gonna be at this time crowd is actually somewhat dead for this but i thought it had some great hardcore bits with some sick looking bumps cactus and terry win the titles in the end35the undertaker vs kane big time ovation for the undertaker much better than there outing at wrestlemania 20 and for a big man vs big man match this was really good it was a great all out brawl with the undertaker taking a sick looking bump through the table wwe was smart by making kane looking strong even through defeat after 2 tombstone kick outs taker finally puts him away with a 3rd one3 12 5wwf championship special guest enforcer mike tysonhbk|c| vs steve austin big heat for tyson crowd goes ape sh*t for austin definitely one of the biggest pops i have heard mixed reaction for hbk this is truly a special match up one of the greatest wrestlemania main events in history you can tell when jr is even out of breath hbk gives it his all in what was supposed to be his last match and austin has rarely been better the animosity and electricity from the crowd is amazing and its as exciting as it gets austin wins with the stunner with tyson joining 3:16 by knocking out michaels austins celebratory victory is a wonder to behold with one of the nosiest crowds you will ever see king said it right they were going nuts55bottom line wrestlemania 14 is one of the greatest for real it has everything you want in a wrestlemania and truly kick started the attitude era this is very special to me because it was the 1st wrestlemania i ever saw back in 98 the austin era has begun!9 12 10<SEP>1
seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie i figured that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that wasnt quite meant to be i watched the first two fight scenes listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by lungren and all of the other thrown-in oriental actors and i found the movie so awful that it was funny then brandon lee enters the story and the one-liners start flying the plot falls apart the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out its welcome as it turns into the worst action movie everlungren beats out his previous efforts in the punisher and others as well as all of van dammes movies seagals movies and stallones non-rocky movies for this distinct honor this movie has the absolute worst acting check out tia carreres face when she is in any scene with dolph thats worth a laugh with the worst dialogue ever brandon lees comment about little dolph is the worst line ever in a film and the worst outfit in a film dolph in full japanese attire picture tango and cash with worse acting meets commando meets friday the 13th because of the senseless nudity and lungrens performance is very jason voorhees-like in an hour and fifteen minute joke of a moviethe good how about not awful performances go to the bad guy who still looks constipated through his entire performance and carrere who somehow says her 5 lines without breaking out laughing brandon lee is just there being lungrens sidekick and doing a really awful job at thatan awful awful movie fear it and avoid it if you do watch it though ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most non-underwater shots speaking of the underwater shots check out the lame water fight scene with the worst fight-scene-ending ever this movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with short attention spans and to fill-in between the flashes of nuditya bad bad movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<SEP>0
dont listen to fuddy-duddy critics on this one this is a gem! young rich joan and her brother find themselves penniless after their father dies - and now they have to work for a living! she naturally becomes a reporter and he just as naturally a driver for the mob! by wild co-incidences their careers meet head on thanks to gangster clark gable in the meantime there is the chance for a moonlight underwear swim for a bunch of pretty young things and for joan to do a couple of risque dance numbers with all the grace of a steam-shovelbut none of this is supposed to be taken seriously - its all good fun from those wonderful pre-code days when hollywood was really naughty joan looks great and displays much of the emotional range that would give her career such longevity thank god she stopped the dancing! gable is remarkable as a slimy gangster - he wasnt a star yet and so didnt have to be the hero great to see him playing something different and william bakewell is excellent as the poor confused brother and there are some great montages and tracking shots courtesy of director harry beaumont who moves the piece on with a cracking pace - and an occasional wink to the audience! great fun!<SEP>1
the actors play wonderfully especially kenneth branagh himself its good that robin williams got the comedy role of osiric otherwise it could be a bit strange to see him in such a production it is really great that kenneth decided to use the fullest version of the text this happens definitely not too often thanks to that the viewers can see the whole not the chosen - by the director - parts also - thank god that the film is in a classical form; no to surrealistic fanfaberies ! although tytus andronicus was impressive nevertheless but still hamlet is a different story at least thats my point of view<SEP>1

and the time came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom - anais nin marcel proust says the real voyage of discovery lies in not seeing new landscapes but in having new eyes author and screenwriter antwone fisher joined the us navy to see new landscapes but the demons of his past prevented him from seeing the world through new eyes based on his autobiography finding fish written many years after the events his story is dramatized in the film antwone fisher denzel washingtons first directorial effort it is a heartfelt if somewhat formulaic look at the painful process of moving from being consumed by ones past to being able to live life in present timerequired to attend therapy sessions after several outbursts of anger at the base the painful aspects of his childhood are shown in flashback as the grown up antwone derek luke recounts his life in sessions with navy psychiatrist jerome davenport denzel washington he is at first unwilling to talk but when he begins the floodgates are opened after his father was shot to death by a girlfriend and antwone was abandoned by his mother after being released from prison he was placed in a foster home where he lived for fourteen years suffering humiliation and sexual abuse according to antwone the treatment by his foster mother mrs tate novella nelson who referred to him only as nigga and by his cousin nadine yolonda ross was in fact much worse than shown on the screenthe only friend he has is a local by named jesse jascha washington who later in the film only adds to his feelings of abandonment it is difficult to build a film around psychiatric sessions but it was done successfully in ordinary people and good will hunting with a great deal more dramatic interest but it succeeds here because of the dominant performances of washington and luke though the films attempt to compress eleven years into a few months seems a bit too facile davenports humanity and warmth however allows fisher to feel safe enough to discuss his difficult past and cheryl joy bryant his new girlfriend who is also in the navy supports him in his struggle to achieve a breakthroughwith cheryls help and dr davenports counseling antwone develops enough self-esteem to return to cleveland and begin the journey to try and find his mother in order to complete the past what comes through in derek lukes incredible performance is antwones longing for acceptance dramatized in a heartbreaking dream shown at the beginning of the film in which he is the guest of honor at a banquet filled with people who love him comedian mort sahl once said that people just have to remember what were all here for: to find our way home antwone fisher touches not only on the longing of one young person to find his way home but reaches all those who have cried themselves to sleep not knowing the joy of being loved<SEP>1
like freddys revenge this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and doesnt go to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it basically alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends this has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise-cracks are quite poor so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy ive not alot to say about this its moderately interesting to see the characters of alice and dan returning from four but not worth watching a movie over uninspriring and unenjoyable possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series<SEP>0
an allegation of aggravated sexual assault along with some other unpleasant peccadilloes including improper use of a broom are made against half a dozen or so of the most popular high-school jocks in glen ridge new jersey by a mildly retarded student heather matarazzo the investigation and building of the case are handed over to the das office where ally sheedy and eric stoltz are put in chargerumors about the case spread through glen ridge an upper-middle-class suburb where the jocks are adored by everyone in the community one of their fathers is a police lieutenant nobody believes matarazzo our boys would never take a slut like that down to the basement rape her and subject her to such sexual humiliation the question is whether sheedy and stoltz will ever be able to shape a sufficiently cogent case that they can bring the jocks to trial matarazzo is not an ideal plaintiff shes desperate for love and friendship and that makes it easy for faux friends to mislead her into making false statements a slimy reporter says you can trust me but it turns out the reporter cant be trusted at all another student a very popular girl in school pulls a linda tripp on matarazzo pretending to be her bosom buddy but all the while asking her leading questions about the incident -- and taping the results! as a consequence watching this story unfold is like being on a roller coaster at first it looks like a good case for sheedy and stoltz but then oops the community organizes against the law then it looks good again but then the reporter interferes then that obstacle is no sooner overcome than linda tripp pokes her big nose into the investigation and makes public the tapes that seem to indicate matarazzo was lying well actually she was lying -- but she was lying to her interrogator in order to please her then thats overcome but matarazzo objects to taking the stand because she doesnt want to be characterized as retarded eric stoltz is fine in the part of the prosecutor i say that for the simple reason that he and i lived in pago pago around the same time i hope he wasnt the kid i had that altercation with at the bar of the seaside club if he was i take back my compliment ally sheedy is a strange actress and hard to characterize she did a marvelous self-restrained job in fine art but i didnt sense any particular effort being put into this role which was rather formulaic anyway i mean neither she nor stoltz nor anyone else could give a bravura performance in whats essentially a comic book storythe producers and director had the good sense to choose heather matarazzo for the role of victim the very worst thing they could have done is cast an ethereally lovely neotenous blond instead matarazzo without being at all ugly looks rather plain and this ordinary quality is complemented by her grooming and make up nor have the writers turned her wistful and gentle she has a temper and is sometimes irritating to listen to which is all for the goodmatarazzos character is the best drawn in the film the jocks are stereotypes pure evil they think themselves above the law barge in on some nice girls party in east orange trash the place during a party far worse than la dolce vitas climactic orgy and leave without explanation or apology they deserve to get it in the neck -- and they doi referred to this as a comic book story and thats pretty much what it is it challenges none of our prejudices it reaffirms out belief that the world can be divided into good and evil and we dont have a moments doubt about whos who what im waiting for -- not really thats just rhetorical -- is a movie almost exactly like this one and a dozen others but in which the victim is lying in order to get her name and photo in the papers and garner all those sympathy chips from right-thinking folk like the rest of usthe film is based on a true story as are so many others weve all seen and even more fictional features eg the accused some are good some are strictly routine okay fair enough now when do we get to see a film about the tawana brawley case in which the teen-aged girl disappeared on a whim for a few days then had her friends strip her tie her up and smear her with dirt so she could claim shed been abducted and raped by the police now that would be a challenge in a way this one simply is not<SEP>0
dark angel rocks! the best show i have seen in ages damn those people who took it off! me and my friends have gatherings to watch every da episode! takes like 4 days but it is worth it! it finished before it finished what it wanted to say and that annoys the hell out of me!<SEP>1
ive seen this movie at least fifty times and after watching it last week for the first time in a long time i still felt itthe story itself was incredible but came alive by spielbergs expertise and the fabulous cast including whoopi goldberg oprah winfrey danny glover and margaret avery akosua busia deserved an oscar nomination for her short but powerful portrayal of nettieyoull experience every human emotion while watching this film i laughed cried and got angry like most great movies it was looked over by the academy with a host of nominations but no wins but this movie without a doubt is definitely one of the best films of all time<SEP>1
i am a big fan of stephen kings work and this film has made me an even greater fan of king pet sematary is about the creed family they have just moved into a new house and they seem happy but there is a pet cemetery behind their house the creeds new neighbor jud played by fred gwyne explains the burial ground behind the pet cemetery that burial ground is pure evil jud tells louis creed that when you bury a human being or any kind of pet up in the burial ground they would come back to life the only problem is that when they come back they are not the same person theyre evil soon after jud explains everything about the pet sematary everything starts to go to hell i wont explain anymore because i dont want to give away some of the main parts in the film the acting that pet sematary had was pretty good but needed a little bit of work the story was one of the main parts of this movie mainly because it was so original and gripping this film features lots of make-up effects that make the movie way more eerie and frightening one of the most basic reasons why this movie sent chills up my back was in fact the make-up effects there is one character in this film that is truly freaky that character is zelda this particular character pops up in the film about three times to be precise zelda is rachel creeds sister who passed away years before but rachel is still haunted by her the first time zelda appears in the movie isnt generally scary because she isnt talking or anything but the second time is the worst and to be honest the second time scares the living **** out of me there is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie it is almost perfect pet sematary delivers great scares some pretty good acting first rate plot and mesmerizing make-up this is truly one of most favorite horror films of all time 10 out of 10<SEP>1
this was a wonderful little american propaganda film that is both highly creative and openly discusses the nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed while late 1944 and into 1945 would reveal just how evil and horrific they were this film unlike other hollywood films to date is the most brutally honest film of the era i have seen regarding nazi atrocitiesthe film begins in a courtroom in the future--after the war is over the film was made in 1944--the war ended in may 1945 in this fictitious world court a nazi leader is being tried for war crimes wilhelm grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal grimms life since 1919 in a series of flashbacks at first it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how grimm was pushed to join the nazis however after a while it becomes very apparent that grimm is just a sadistic monster these episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate dramaall in all the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second-tier actors there are many compelling scenes and performances--especially the very prescient jewish extermination scene towards the end that cant help but bring you close to tears it was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super-creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first overall its a must-see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good filmfyi--this is not meant as a serious criticism of the film but hitler was referred to as that paper hanger this is a reference to the myth that hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper this is in fact not true--previously hed been a starving artist homeless person and served well in the german army in wwi a horrible person yes but never a paper hanger!<SEP>1

a difficult film to categorize i was never giving it 110% concentration & consequently as simple as the plot appeared i couldnt say for certain exactly who was doing what amongst the american fbi characters & what their roles were nor could i take the irwins seriously as film characters when their lines & scenes were all in the style of one of his shows not acted outthis is nothing more than a glorified episode of a discovery tv show with a largely insignificant sub plot going on which just seemed to get in the way however as any irwin show is always worth a watch this film is well worth a look too but not on christmas day talking of which ive better things to do too than be on herea high 410<SEP>0
what about dahmers childhood- the double hernia operation which is believed to have sparked off his obsession with the inner workings of the human body what about infinity land - the game he invented as a child which involved stick men being annihilated when they came too close to one another suggesting that intimacy was the ultimate danger what about the relationship between his parents and the emotional problems of his mother that were far more relevant than just his own relationship with his father his feelings of neglect when his brother was born what about his fascination with insects and animals how he would dissect roadkill and hang it up in the woods behind his homewhat about focusing more on his cannibalism and what about his parents divorce these are all things that should have been included in the film instead the film maker chose to give us a watered down snapshot from a night or two in his life and combine it with series of confusing and at times unnecessary flashbacks to events that werent even particularly relevant to our understanding of dahmerwhy didnt the film maker show how dahmer was interested in people as objects rather than people he could have made this point many times particularly in the scenes in which he drugs his victims whilst he has sex with them which actually took place in a health club not a night club instead he just shows him ramming away at them from behindwhilst i appreciate there is only so much information you can cram into 90 minutes or however long but why spend such a large part of the film examining his relationship with luis pinet known as rodney in this film my only guess is that the director was trying to build up pinets character to try and make us fear for or empathise with him but this film is supposed to be about jeffrey dahmer so why couldnt he have spend those forty five minutes on something else if the scene and their relationship was important enough to warrant such time then fair enough but it wasnt the scene in which he kills steven hicks his first victim is a vital part of the jeffrey dahmer story because it was the first killing and because of the effect that killing had on the rest of his life unfortunately the film doesnt explain that it was his first killing or that he didnt kill again for nine years we assume because his hair style is different and he is wearing glasses that this is a flashback but to when and why what about the shrine he made in his sitting room towards the end of his career-one of the most important clues we have towards understanding dahmer and his motivationssome people may find my need for accuracy in fact and detail a bit anal but having studied jeffrey dahmer in depth it is plain to see that this film has very little in common with the person he was and the crimes he committed why bother to spend the time making a film loosely based on jeffrey dahmer rather than tackle the real issues behind his descent into madness and the carnage that ensuedfinally a film with subject matter as repellent as this should carry an 18 certificate not a 15 we needed to see his perversion in more depth to understand just how detached he was from the rest of us that doesnt mean showing the drill actually entering konerak sinthasomphones head for instance but at least an indication of the amount of people he killed and what his modus operandi was when actually killing anyone watching this film who doesnt know the story of dahmer might come away thinking he had only killed a few people he actually killed seventeen menaside from the facts and lack of depth the film isnt all bad there is some nice cinematography and good performances from the two main characters id like to see this done again by a film maker who has more knowledge more energy and a better reason for making the film in the first place<SEP>0
a beautiful film touching profoundly up the simple yet divine aspects of humanity this movie was almost perfect and seeing as nothing in this world can be truly perfect that is pretty good the only minor thing i subjectively object to is the pacing at some points in the middle of the story the acting is also very good and all the actors easily top actors in high-profile films the actual directing seems to have been well thought through and the script must have been amazing there are some truly breathtaking moments of foreshadowing and a quite gorgeous continuing circular composition of the storythe moment in the movie when the main character achieves that feeling of being in heaven is the perfect ending to a truly brilliant yarn<SEP>1
the movie was very moving it was tender and funny at the same time the scenery was absolutely beautiful! peter faulk and paul reiser gave award winning performances olympia dukakis was great i understand due to the story line her part had to be brief but i did wish i could have seen more of her-she is a true proyou will be able to recall experiences from your own life hopefully in a positive way after seeing this movie we were fortunate to see paul reiser at a q and a after the viewing he is a wonderful man clever eloquent and a real person it was truly an enjoyable night out!this is a must see movie you will be so grateful you went<SEP>1
usually when we use the word escapist we mean it negatively; warren beattys big screen version of dick tracy proves that escapist can be good this is truly one entertaining movie as the eponymous yellow-clad fearless title character beatty creates a detective to whom we can all relate: ready for action but not without his weaknessesfrom there the rest of characters are almost a world unto themselves tess truehart glenne headly is as glamorous as one would expect the hubby of any crime fighter to be; breathless mahoney madonna is possibly the most perplexing person imaginable; big boy caprice al pacino is the average villain: ruthless but cool other characters include the speech-challenged mumbles dustin hoffman the over-musical 88 keys mandy patinkin and the kid charlie korsmo charles durning james caan dick van dyke estelle parsons catherine ohara seymour cassel paul sorvino and kathy bates also staroh wait a minute i havent even explained the plot! the plot involves tracy trying - and failing so far - to find some way to nab big boy simultaneously some very bizarre events have been going on in town the answers to which may or may not be closer than everyone thinksof course the main thing about this movie is that its fun to watch if warren beatty was having trouble acting his age then he made good use of that here dick tracy is one cool movie<SEP>1
after dark my sweet is a great modern noir filled with seedy characters dirt roads and of course sweaty characters it seems that most of the truly great noirs of the last two or three decades have taken place in the south where the men glisten and the ladies um glisten too why because its hooooottttttttttt and because everyone looks better wet at least the men do - sweaty women leave me clammy anyway - there might be some spoilers in here this film is a wonderful example of everything a noir should be - steady pacing though some with attention disorders refer to it as slow clearly and broadly drawn though not simple characters and tons of atmosphere noir if anything is about moods and attitudes thats why the great ones are not marked by your traditional definitions of great acting look at bogart mitchum hurt and nicholson - they and their characters were anything but real - but they had style and sass and in a crime movie thats exactly what you want or quickly paced adventures again all great noirs seem to be on slow burn like a cigarette great noirs create an environment and you just inhabit it with the characters for a couple hours after dark my sweet lets you do that - and it lets you enjoy the company of some very interesting and complex characters uncle bud and collie are intriguing - never allowing the audience to know what really makes them tick - and patric and dern i love bruce dern by the way are pitch perfect dern especially see previous comment they take the basic outlines of a character and give them depth and elicit our sympathies the story itself is also interesting therere better plots in the world of noir hardly any mystery here - mostly its suspense but this one is solid if anything the simply okay plot has more to do with jim thompsons writing than anything else with thompson plots are almost secondary; he eschewed the labyrinthine tales of hammett and chandler for simpler stories with stronger more confusing characters look at a novel like the killer inside me and and youll see right away from the title what its all about when it comes to thompson its not what its about its how its about it to quote roger ebert so really the relatively simple plot of a kidnapping is not the point and if you dont like it well the jokes on you why this is an 8star movie rather than a 10star one is because of the female lead shes not bad per se but shes not angelica huston or anette benning see the adaptation of jim thompsons the grifters if you dont know what im talking about - besides its a better movie and you should start there for contemporary noir - its the best of the 1990s and challenges blood simple for the title of best since chinatown she simply doesnt have the chops or the looks for that matter and though she and patric have some chemistry i dont have it with her so there<SEP>1
perhaps the biggest waste of production time money and the space on the video store shelf if someone suggests you see this movie run screaming in the other direction unless of course youre into self-abuse<SEP>0
this is why i so love this website ! i saw this film in the 1980s on british television over the years it is one i have wished i knew more about as it has stayed with me as one of the single most extraordinary things i have ever seen in my life with barely a few key words to remember it by i traced the film here and much information including the fact its about to become an off-broadway musical !interestingly unlike the previous comment maker i do not remember finding this film sad or exploitative on the contrary the extraordinary relationship between the mother and daughter stuck in the mind as a testimony of great strength honour and dignity ironic you may think considering the squalor of their lives maybe its because i live in britain where fading grandeur has an established language in the lives of old money where squalor is often tolerated as evidence of good breeding; i saw it as a rare and unique portrayal of enormous spirit deep and profound humour whose utterly fragile and delicately balanced fabric gave it poise and respect in a way i was sorry to see it being discussed as a cult over the years as it faded in my mind it shone the brightest above all others as a one off brilliant & outstanding televisual experience it was such a deeply private expose it seems odd to think of it becoming so public as to be a new york musical but perhaps somewhere the daughter will be amused by such an outcome it is she who will have the last laugh maybethey made a musical out of her before you jackie o<SEP>1
the days is a typical family drama with a little catch - you must relate to the characters emotions in every way possible in order for you to truly appreciate the show[possible spoilers for those who are unfamiliar with the show]the story obviously for all the people who has watched the show is the world of cooper day the middle child of the family he records his days with his family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer one day because of his observations his family includes a mother a father a perfect sister and a genius-little-brother the first episode which is going to sound a bit stupid since john scott shepard has created this situation - both the sister and mother gets pregnant thats the first situation the writer hits then the father quits his job at the law firm the youngest son gets a panic attack the middle child gets in a fight with the sisters boyfriend this is all in a days work[spoilers]i admire this show i dont know its a bit crappy but i like it first i thought the camera-work was a ripoff but then i got used it and started to like it i liked the quiet conversations under a dark light i liked the intimate feeling of the show i liked the low-budget style i liked the acting i admire the story then i find myself wanting a second season of the days i slowly became a fan of it as the 6-episode airing on abc came to an end its a really good show and its nothing like the oc the two have nothing in common so i hope fans will stop comparing themand if you can relate to either abby jack natalie cooper or even nate youll like this show a lot<SEP>1
i honestly had no idea that the notorious big bert i gordon the director; not the murdered rapper was still active in the 80s! i always presumed the deliciously inept empire of the ants stood as his last masterful accomplishment in the horror genre but that was before my dirty little hands stumbled upon an ancient and dusty vhs copy of the coming a totally obscure and unheard of witchery-movie that actually turned out a more or less pleasant surprise! what starts out as a seemingly atmospheric tale of late dark ages soon takes a silly turn when a villager of year 1692 inexplicably becomes transferred to present day salum massachusetts and promptly attacks a girl in the history museum for you see this particular girl is the reincarnation of ann putman who was a bona fide evil girl in 1692 and falsely accused over twenty people of practicing witchcraft which led to their executions at the state the man who attacked loreen lost his wife and daughter this and wants his overdue revenge but poor and three centuries older loreen is just an innocent schoolgirl or is she burned at the stake unfolds like a mixture between the exorcist and witchfinder general with a tad bit of the time machine thrown in for good measure way to go bert! the plot becomes sillier and more senseless with every new twist but at least it never transcends into complete boredom like too often the case in other contemporary witchcraft movies like the dunwich horror and the devonsville terror the film jumps back and forth between the events in present day and flashbacks of 1692; which keeps it rather amusing and fast-paced the ann putman girl is quite a fascinating character reminiscent of the abigail williams character in the more commonly known stage play the crucible also depicted by winona ryder in the 1996 motion picture there are a couple of cool death sequences like the teacher in the graveyard or the journalist in the library that are committed by the ghost of malignant reverend who made a pact with ann putman and perhaps even the devil himself the film gets pretty spastic and completely absurd near the end but overall theres some good cheesy fun to be had plus the least you can say about bert i gordon is that he definitely build up some directorial competences over the years<SEP>0
quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathoma group of top quality actors in the main well cast with a couple of notable exceptions who give pretty good performances penelope keith is perfect as aunt louise and equally good is joanna lumley as diana all do well with the scripts they were givenso much for the good the average would include the sets nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book although bizarrely the house they use for the dower house looks remarkably like it it is clear then that the dower house is far too big in the later parts the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the uk presumably to save money although with a little imagination i have no doubt they could have recreated ceylonnow to the bad the screenplay this is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it edward does not die in the battle of britain but survives blinded he makes a brief appearance then commits suicide - why loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with gus to a sensible farmers wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear less emotional than brief encounter gus a man besotted and passionately in love is prepared to give up his love without complaint walter mudge in the book turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who wont speak aunt biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification the dower house is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with jess who has a fear of armed soldiers whilst miss mortimers breasts are utterly delightful i could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward the delightfully named nettlebed becomes the mundane dobson the word limit prevents me from continuing the listthere is a sequel which i lost all interest in watching after this nonsense and i wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story it is difficult to image that rosamunde pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book; presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased<SEP>0
there is no greater disservice to do to history than to misrepresent it this takes the easiest and most shallow route simply portraying him as a monster only showing his negative sides and exaggerating them those who are ignorant of the past doom us to repeat it he was a human being that may prove tough to some people to accept but an important part of life is facing that which we dont want to rather than demonizing the man we ought to try to understand him otherwise we stand little chance of preventing anyone similar in the future or possibly even the present from succeeding at anything of remotely comparable scope as far as damage and misery goes hate him and what he did dont make him into something mythical intentionally or otherwise frankly far too much of this mini-series could play dumb dumb *duuum*! after or during scenes the whole thing nods nudges and winks at the audience with a clear message of was this guy evil or what incorporating every single bad traitas well as making up several that go directly against who and what he was letting them appear more or less out of nowhere and having them be constant throughout his life not something he came to believe or claimed to this should never be used to educate use der untergangdownfall in english and maybe point out the few inaccuracies of that instead this this is disrespectful to the actual events that took place and to any and all survivors not to mention those who died the cinematic quality top-notch its well-done through and through excellent production values a solid arc to the well-told plot what characterization does occur is strong and credible dialog and script are great all acting performances are masterfulcarlyle looks and behaves the role as it was written perfectly the music is well-composed cinematography and editing are flawless and creative and this is definitely dramatic entertaining and riveting they get dates and many occurrences and do them justice if i had been offered to work on this and did not feel i could be objective enough to have hitler appear as a fully fleshed-out person i would have declined citing that as the reason i dont blame anyone for loathing him how can you forgive what he did and are we sure that we should that is not what i am suggesting finally let me point out that as i write this we are in a world-wide economic crisis that has lasted for about two years and that is not terribly dissimilar to the stock market crash of 1929 the two reasons it hasnt led to a depression of the new millennium are as follows: governments are giving money to the banks to keep the market going and the majority of the countries is now friendly towards one another apart from that the lesson hadnt been learned hopefully it has now back to this my suggestion read a book non-fiction dealing with the subject there are plenty of informative smart ones the dvd holds a trailer i recommend this only to those who know better and vehemently urge anyone who has watched it to seek out the truth 810<SEP>1
this is a really stupid movie in that typical 80s genre: action comedy conceptwise it resembles rush hour but completely lacks the action the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie let it be known that i enjoy jay leno as a stand-up and as a talk show host but he just cannot act he is awful when he tries to act tough - he barely manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while saying his one-liners which by the way arent very funny and seeing him run even back then is not a pleasant sight in addition i have a feeling that pat morita - at least by todays standards - doesnt give a very politically correct impression of the japanese dont even get me started about the story i give it a 2 out of 10<SEP>0
add to the list of caricatures: a southern preacher and congregation a torch singer sophie tucker a dancing chorus and the mills brothers -- it only makes it worsecontemptible burlesques of negro performers who themselves often appear in films to be parodying themselves and their race though the negro comedy may have been accepted in its day its extremely offensive today and i doubt that it was ever funny though i wouldnt have been offended i dont think that id have laughed at the feeble attempts at humor as an 11-year-old white boy however i might not have understood some of it<SEP>0
i love dracula but this movie was a complete disappointment! i remember lee from other dracula films from when i was younger and i thought he was great but this movie was really bad i dont know if it was my youth that fooled me into believing lee was the ultimate dracula with style looks attraction and the evil underneath that or maybe it was just this film that disappointed me but can you imagine dracula with an snobbish english accent and the body language to go along with it do you like when a plot contains unrealistic choices by the characters and is boring and lacks any kind of tension then this is a movie for you! otherwise - dont see it! i only gave it a 2 because somehow i managed to stay awake during the whole moviesorry but if you liked this movie then you must have been sleep deprived and home alone in a dark room with lots of unwatched space behind you maybe alone in your parents house or in a strangers home cause not even the characters in this flick seemed afraid and i think that sums up the whole thing!or maybe you like this film because of its place in dracula cinema history perhaps being fascinated by how the dracula story has evolved from nosferatu to what it is today cause as movie it isnt that appealing it doesnt pull you in to the suggestive mystery that for me make the vampyre myth so fascinating and furthermore it has so much of that tacky 70ies feel about it the scenery looks like cheap theatre and i dont say that rejecting everything made in the 70ies cause i can love old film as well as new<SEP>0
how many minutes does it take to paint a poem in this film much too long it tells the story about the impact of a first love between two schoolboys the boys cant withhold touching each other and making love after a while one gets distracted by a brief encounter with a sensual guy in the disco and that raises doubt: exploration fantasy longing lust and feelings of loosing grip on your love are themes that are all extensively painted with music close-ups and silent scenes like telling a poem but it really takes too long annoying long shame the effort was promising<SEP>0
this has to be one of the best if not the best film i have seen for a very very long time had enough action to satisfy an fan and yet the plot was very good i really enjoyed the filmand had me hooked from start to finishadded blood and gore in there but brought the realistic nature of what happens to the front of the film and even had a tear jerker ending for many people i should thinkit is a must watch for anyone seen many reviews slating the film but to be fair most the films that get bad reviews turn out to be some of the best this proves it once againrent this film buy this film just go out and watch this film you will not be disappointed<SEP>1
this is a slow moving story no action no crazy suspense no abrupt surprises if you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about lovey-dovey romance dont waste your time and money on the other hand if youre into dialog masterful story telling thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie i recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert though because the pace the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolgathering mood its truly fantastic i really mean thatethan hawke and julie delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but thankfully the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural warm and tender they act and feel each other out from the very beginning making you feel as an intruderin their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner i thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but i may be underestimating their intelligence still it did not ruin the moviethe overall story is very simple which i think gives the movie its charm and ultimately its powerbottom line: the movies flow is slow the dialog is fascinating the story builds gently systematically and substantive the build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding<SEP>1
ettore scola one of the most refined and grand directors we worldly citizens have is not yet available on dvd its summer 2001 right now mysteries to goggle the mind this grand classic returned to the theaters in my home-town thanks to a sophia loren - summer-retrospective and to see it again on the big screen after all these years of viewing it on a video-tape it is a true gift to avoid a critique but nonetheless try to prove a point: i took my reluctant younger brother with me to see this film he never saw the film before and doesnt like those italian oldies like all the others in the theater he was intrigued by this wonder even during the end-titles the theater remained completely silent this special day is truly special a wonder of refinement and a big loss if you havent seen it yet<SEP>1
if you loved pulp fiction and like hand held cameras you should love this film i liked the quirky story even though i feel that pulp fiction was the most over-rated movie since the english patient and found the characters unrealistic but interesting its not on the waterfront or citizen kane and is burdened by european pretentiousness but the worst part by far is the hand held camera it is so distracting and annoying i found myself waiting desperately for the movie to end i dont know why new directors think this method of filming is so great if you are prone to motion sickness stay away the hand held camera will have you nauseous in about 10 minutes<SEP>0
i have seen a couple movies on eating disorders but this one was definitely my favorite one the problem with the other ones was that the people with the eating disorders towards the end just automatically get better or accept the fact that they need help and thats it this movie i thought was more realistic cause in this one the main character lexi doesnt automatically just get better she gets better and then has a drawback i think this movie shows more than the others that ive seen that getting better doesnt just happen its hard work and takes time its a long path to recovery i think this movie shows all of that very well there should be more movies like this<SEP>1
a delightful gentle comedic gem until the last five minutes which degenerate into run of the mill british tv farce the last five minutes cost it 2 points in my rating despite this major plot and style flaw its worth watching for the character acting and the unique cornwall setting many fine little bits to savor like the tense eternity we all go through waiting for the bank approval after the clerk has swiped the credit cardmade more piquant when were not - quite - sure the card is not maxed<SEP>1
yes this is an ultra-low budget movie so the acting isnt award winning material and at times the action is slow-paced because the filmmakers are shooting longer sequences and not a million instants that then get edited into a movie this film makes up for that with an outstanding script that takes vampirism seriously explains it and develops a full plot out of it aside from the vampire story we get detailed genetics info legal and law enforcement martial arts action philosophical musings and some good metal music kudos go to dylan oleary the directorwritermain actor it is beyond me how this man could have fulfilled all these roles and do them so well i think to appreciate this movie you have to be well-versed in all sorts of themes to see that the writer did a lot of research and knows about all these things there are some great camera work too interesting camera angles and one underwater vampire attack- something i havent seen before but which pays homage to the underwater zombie attack in fulcis zombi the casting is good in so far as the sexy female is sexy indeed the main vampire also looks perfect for the role the female victim looks vulnerable my only complaint is that for a low budget horror flick there should have been more nudity if you want to see an original vampire movie with a great story this flick is for you im looking forward to seeing future projects by mr oleary<SEP>1
i loved watching sea hunt back in the day i was in grammar school and would get home do my homework and by 4:30 would be ready to watch sea hunt and mike nelson in his underwater adventures i loved it ! he took to you a place not very accessible at that time under the great blue sea pre thunderball or even before cousteau became common there was mike nelson sparking the imagination of kids id be willing to wager that more than a few kids developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the sciences from watching this show underwater photography also progressed the fascination for exploration is easily stimulated thru watching this show watch and enjoy !!!<SEP>1
in what is a truly diverse cast this show hits its stride on fox it is the kind of sitcom that grows on you if you just watch 1 show you might not like it much but once you watch two or three- you get hookedthis is because some of the jokes hit & some miss depending upon how you view them as is usual today the themes are very mature the humor is usually very mature too often the most funny parts are the parts where the mature themes collide with the innocent onesred kurtwood smith a veteran actor does some very good deadpan type of humor on this show debra jo rupp plays well in this ensemble cast too danny masterson the oldest actor of the kids is very good too laura prepon donna looks better in the earlier shows as a natural redhead who got the idea of making her a blonde she shows very good talent & comedic timing often she looks good without make up toothis is one of the better entries on fox in the sitcom department & its most successful live action one since married with children<SEP>1
enjoyable movie although i think it had the potential to be even better if it had more depth to it it is a mystery halfway through the film as to knowing why elly is such a recluse then when we are finally given an explanation going back to her childhood there still isnt much detail perhaps had they shown flashbacks or somethinganyway it is still a good movie that id watch again 710<SEP>1
johnny weissmullers final film as king of the jungle after 16 years in the role tarzan and the mermaids is bound to disappoint all but the most ardent of his fans at 44 the ex-olympian one of hollywoods most active party animals was long past the slim athleticism of his youth and looked tired although he was in marginally better condition than in his previous entry tarzan and the huntressnot only had weissmuller gotten too old for his role; johnny sheffield the quintessential boy had grown to manhood he was a strapping 17-year old so he was written out of the script under the pretext of being away at school brenda joyce at 35 was appearing in her fourth of five films as jane she would provide the transition when lex barker became the new tarzan in 1949s tarzans magic fountain and was still as wholesomely sexy as everproduced by sol lesser at rko on a minuscule budget the cast and crew took advantage of cheaper labor by filming in mexico while the location gave a decidedly hispanic air to what was supposedly darkest africa veteran director robert florey utilized the country extensively incorporating cliff diving and an aztec temple into the storywhen a young island girl tyrone powers future bride linda christian is rescued in a jungle river by tarzan he learns that a local high priest george zucco one of filmdoms most enduring villains had virtually enslaved the local population threatening retribution from a living god if they dont do his bidding the girl had been chosen to become the gods bride so she fled faster than you can say is this a dumb plot or what the girl is kidnapped by the priests henchmen and returned to the island and tarzan followed by jane colorful spanish character benjy charmingly played by john laurenz who sings several tunes and a government commissioner are off to take on the deity and his priest poor cheeta is left behind after a series of discoveries the god is simply a con man in an aztec mask working with the priest in milking the islands rich pearl beds a bit of brawling action and comic relief and songs by benjy everything reaches the expected happy conclusionremarkably tarzan and the mermaids features a musical score by the brilliant film composer dimitri tiomkin and is far better than what youd expect from this b movie! while the film would provide a less-than-auspicious end to weissmullers time in tarzans loincloth he would immediately go on to play jungle jim a more eloquent variation of the ape man in khakis the talent involved lifted the overall product at least a little above the total mess it could have beentarzan was about to get a make over and become much sexier<SEP>0
this is one really bad movie ive racked my brain and i cannot come up with one positive comment to make the acting is atrocious ive seen more believable performances on cable access the plot is ridiculous stolen diamonds secret recordings of the president and a shark that attacks anything that gets near it should have made for cheesy fun at the worst night of the sharks isnt even so bad its good the dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written seconds before its filmed and to top it off night of the sharks has the worst soundtrack ive ever heard im surprised my ears didnt start bleeding from the 80s techno synthesized sounds that someone actually bothered to recordfrom everything ive read the italian film industry was dead by 1987 night of the sharks is like a final nail in the coffin<SEP>0
my wife and i took our 13 year old son to see this film and were absolutely delighted with the winsome fun of the film it has extra appeal to boys and men who remember their childhood but even women enjoy the film and especially hallie kate eisenbergs refrain boys are so weird its refreshing to see a film that unapologetically shows that boys and girls are indeed different in their emotional and social makeup boys really do these kinds of strange things and usually survive to tell the story and scare their mothers silly! we enjoyed the film so much that my son and an 11 year old friend myself and my daughters 23 year old boyfriend went to see the movie the next day for a guys day out we had even more fun the second time around and everyone raved about it its clean and delightfully acted by a pre-adolescent cast reminiscent of the tv classic freaks and geeks we all feel it will become a sleeper hit not unlike the freaks & geeks which didnt survive its first season but sold-out its dvd release do see it especially if you have boys and youll find it stimulates conversation about fun and safety! girls will love it because of the opportunity it affords to say boys are so weird! dont miss it<SEP>1
i love this movie my only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changedits true that frank sinatra does not get a chance to sing as much in this movie but its also nice that its not just another frank sinatra movie where its mostly him doing the singingi actually thought it was better to use marlon brandos own voice as he has the voice that fits and i could not see someone with this great voice pulling off the gangster feel of his voicestubby kayes sit down youre rockin the boat is a foot-tappin sing-a-long that i just love he is a hard act to follow with his version and i still like his the bestvivian blaine is just excellent in this part and adelaides lament is my favorite of her songsi really thought jean simmons was perfect for this part maybe i would not have first considered her but after seeing her in the part it made sensemichael kidds choreography is timeless if it were being re staged in the year 2008 i would not change a thingi find that many times something is lost from the stage version to the movie version but this kept the feel of the stage even though it was on filmi thought the movie was well cast i performed in regional versions of this and its one of my favorites of that period<SEP>1
this movie is likely the worst movie ive ever seen in my life -- surpassing the previous most god-awful movie spawn of slithis which i saw when i was about 10bad acting stilted and ridiculous dialog incomprehensible plot mishmashed cut scenes even the music was annoying did i leave anything out well the special effects werent bad -- but cgi does not a decent movie makei cant believe i actually spent money to see this movie if anyone has the contact info for hyung-rae shim the director please forward it to my user name at gmail and ill contact him to personally demand a refund<SEP>0
bill mahers religulous is not an attack on organized religion its an attack on christianity and islam apart from ridiculing a bunch of rabbis inventing warped machines to get around sabbath regulations he really doesnt attack judaism and seems enraged when a rabbi actually challenges the existence of the state of israel if bill maher followed his hypothesis to its logical conclusion he would realize that the very creation of israel in the palestinian territories is based on the so called holy books of organized religion this is evidence of his complete and utter lack of objectivity or focus in the creation of this filmi find it really hard to believe that the man is atheist or even all that intelligent anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs but what do you have to offer them in return nowhere does he actually tell them why he thinks theyre stupid what makes him the rational person in the room in a way it reflects how he really isnt and in the process ends up looking just as stupid as those peopleif you want to watch a good moviedocumentary about the actual evils of religion and how religion can actually be detrimental to the human civilization watch richard dawkins root of all evil it is a brilliantly researched documentary clearly outlining what it hopes to achieve and howbill mahers religulous is not funny poses no interesting questions nor does it provide any insight on so controversial a topic it seems to be the rantings and ravings of an old man disgruntled with his catholic upbringing i almost feel sorry for him<SEP>0
i was thinking that the main character the astronaut with the bad case of the runsin his case his skin hair muscles etc could always get more movie work after hed been reduced to a puddle all he has to do is get a job as the blob the premise of this flick is pretty lame an astronaut gets exposed to sunspot radiationi think and so begins to act like an ice cream cone on a hot day not only is this a puzzler but apparently he has to kill humans and consume their flesh so that he can maintain some kind of cell integrity huh have you ever noticed that whenever any kind of radiation accident or experiment happens the person instantly turns into a killing machine why is thatthe astronaut lumbers off into the night from the secret facilitywhich has no security whatsoever shedding parts of himself as he goes apparently he retains just enough memory to make him head for the launch pad maybe because he wanted to return to space thus begins the part of the movie thats pretty much filler with a doctor wandering around with a geiger counter trying to find the melting man by the buzz he gives off he kills a stupid bill gates look-alike fisherman scares a little girl a la the frankenstein monster movie and finishes off a wacky older couplepunishing them karmically for stealing some lemons then theres a short scene where he whacks his former general and a very long scene where he kills a young pothead and chases his girlfriend around youd think that after she cuts his arm off and he run away the scene would shift but nowere treated to about ten minutes of the woman huddled into a corner panting and screaming in terror even though the monster is gone all i could think wasdirectors girlfriend anyonethe end of the movie is even lamer than the rest of it the melting man finishes turning into a pile of goo and thennothing thats it thats the end of the movie well at least that meant that there was no room for a sequel<SEP>0
an excellent movie superb acting by mary alice phillip m thomas and a young irene cara tony king was very realistic in his role of satin this movie was one of the last predominately all black movies of the 70s and unlike the blaxploitation movies of that era this movie actually had a plot and was very well done the movie soundtrack sung by aretha franklin was popular on the r&b charts at the time<SEP>1
one of the best films ive ever seen robert duvalls performance was excellent and outstanding he did a wonderful job of making a character really come to life his character was so convincing it made me almost think i were in the theater watching it live i give it 5 stars<SEP>1
one has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film ascript existed that made any sense was the rough cut 3 hourslong and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives why would anyone finance this mess i will say that tomwlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he canwith the dialogue and dramatic situations he is given butcharacters come and go for no apparent reason continuity isnon-existent and the acting cinematography and direction are toput it politely amateurish not one sleeps is an unfortunatechoice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyoneactually attempt to actually watch this film<SEP>0
written and directed by steve gordon running time: 97 minutes classified pgit was the quintessential comedy of the decade it won sir john gielgud the academy award it was even featured in vh1s i love the 80s and it looks just as good today as it did upon its initial release arthur is the acclaimed comedy classic about a drunken millionaire played with enthusiasm and wit by dudley moore in an oscar-nominated performance who must choose between the woman he loves and the life hes grown accustomed to while the basic plot is one big cliche theres nothing trite about this congenial combination of clever dialogue and hilarious farce arthur bach is essentially nothing more than a pretentious jerk but you cant help but like him especially when he delivers lines such as dont you wish you were me i know i do! hes also a delineation from the archetypical movie hero: unlike most wealthy characters we see on the silver screen hes not ashamed of being filthy rich in one scene a man asks him what does it feel like to have all that money to which he responds it feels great moore lends such charisma and charm to a character that would otherwise be loathed by his audience and gielgud is simply perfect as the arrogant servant addressing his master with extreme condescension in spite of the fact that his salary depends on him arthur is one of those movies that doesnt try to be brilliant or particularly exceptional: it just comes naturally the screenplay -- which also earned a nod from the academy -- is saturated with authentic laugh-out-loud dialogue this is the kind of movie that when together with a bunch of poker buddies you quote endlessly to one another it also looks at its characters with sincere empathy there have been a number of comedies that attempt to dip into drama by including the death or illness of a principal star including both grumpy old mens but few can carry it off because we just dont care when this movie makes the dubious decision to knock off the butler it actually works because we genuinely like these people why should you see arthur the answer is simple: because its an all-around non-guilty pleasure at a period in which films are becoming more and more serious arthur reminds us what it feels like to go to the movies and just have a good time**** - classic<SEP>1
overall performance :- at last the long waiting aag hits the screens unfortunately it couldnt set progressive fire in the audience the first best thing to talk about the movie is the idea of remaking the mighty sholay and varma made a nice choice of changing the total backdrop of the movie if he repeated the same ramghad backdrop people will again say there is nothing new in this different background is appreciative but the way he presented it is not worthy right from the start of his career with siva in telugu he had been using the same lighting and kind of background i seriously dunno this guy varma considers about lighting or not or may be he has no other lighting technique other than like gordon willis godfather its all dutch dutch dutch dutch why would some body use so many dutch angles and extreme closeup shots!!!!!!! the shot division is lame characters couldnt carry an emotion performances are not to their mark storytelling is worse background is really really terriblebabban:- amitabhz been over prioritized to his job varma produced great villains like bikumatre bhavtakur das mallik bhai but this time he failed in carving the all time best characters of hindi cinema theres no comparison of gabbar with babban babban is a more psycho rather than a villain still he has a soft corner for his brother its a gift in this movie amitabhz performance is not to his mark his appearance itself is pathetic the scar on his nose symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white cinema what ever they worked on babban is not successful babban is no comparison with gabbarnarsimha:- the first best thing about this character is not to put audience in suspense about his hands if varma did that it would be like teaching abcd to a bachelor degree holder itz good he opened the secret early but the flashback is pathetic varma couldnt use a great actor like mohanlal to his markdurga:- the only character with betterment this character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the storyheroo raj ghunguroo:- no body bothers or at least considers these character the utter failure of movie starts when director could not work on the close friendship between our heroz these characters carry nothing to this movieramgopalvarma:- his quality is degrading diminishing aag totally can be treated as a c grade movie sholay is a fire of revenge problem of a town meaning for true friendship and highly appreciated nuisance and fun by dharmendra aag never carried an emotion with its characters storytelling is too weak that it could not make audience feel sympathy for the characters dont compare aag with sholay still u will not like itif you dare watch this movie you will be burnt alive in ramgopal varma ki aag<SEP>0
strangler of the swamp was made by low budget studio prc and is certainly one of their best movies ive seena man who was hanged for a murder he didnt commit returns as a ghost for revenge on the people who accused him he uses a rope to strangle his victims and after several deaths including the old man who operates the ferry across the swamp he disappears the old mans granddaughter takes over the ferry herself and also falls in love with one of the local men and they decide to get marriedthis movie has plenty of foggy atmospheres which makes it very creepy toothe cast includes rosemary la planche blake edwards and charles middleton flash gordon as the stranglerstrangler of the swamp is a must for old horror fans like myself excellentrating: 3 and a half stars out of 5<SEP>1
i missed the entire season of the show and started watching it on abc website during the summer of 2007 i am absolutely crazy about the show i think the entire cast is excellent its one of my favorite show ever i just checked the abc program lineup for this fall and did not see it on the schedule that is really sad i hope they will bring it back maybe they are waiting until bridget moynahan has her baby or is it only my wishful thinking i read some of the comments posted about the show and see so many glowing remarks similar to mine i certainly hope that abc will reconsider its decision or hopefully another station will pick it up<SEP>1
lame plot and two-dimensional script made characters look like cardboard cut-outs needless to say this made it difficult to feel empathy for any of the characters especially the fiancé; he looked and acted more like a cartoon in summary i guess you could say it was on par with your typical made for tv drama it uses just about every cliché in the book the tortured classical musician who wants to break-out and play salsa the free-spirited fiancée engaged to a bean counter personality she doesnt love i wont list them or else it would be a spoiler because id be giving away the whole plot the dancing was ok but nothing special ive seen worse 3 stars for good music the band was really tight i saw it on youtube thankfully i didnt pay good money to see it at a theater im still a little shocked at how many great reviews this movie has garnished<SEP>0
now let me tell you about this movie this movie is my favorite movie!!! this movie has excellent combat fighting this movie does sound like a silly story line about how jet li plays a super hero like spider-man or etc but once youve seen this movie you would probably want to see it again and again i rate this movie 1010<SEP>1
ive read one comment which labeled this film trash and a wasteof time i think this person got their political undies tugged a bittoo muchi just rented the new criterion dvds of both yellow and bluethese films--although hardly great--have at least become ofhistorical interest as to the so-called radical studentpolitical-social movementof the late 60si hadnt seen either picture and from their notorious reputation iwas expecting some real porn there isnt any there is frontalnudity including the still verboten frontal male nudity automaticnc-17--the orwellian-x in the us but i wasnt expecting the filmsin-your-face democratic socialist message though it tends to the simplistic i thought it occassionally madeits points well both films occassionally had me laughing out loudand the directors commentary made it clear there was plenty ofparody in the film especially the supposedly pornographic sexscenes the first such scene is very realistic the lead couple isclumsy inept funny and endearing in their first copulation scenethe second--which caused the most complaints--has fakedcunnilingus and fellatio and the last is the end of an angry fightthat is believablethe extras include an informative introduction to the film aninterview with the original american distributor and his attorneyexcerpts from trial testimony in the us and a diary commentaryby the director on some scenesthis is the film that blue noses wouldnt let alone and led to thepivotal prurient interest with no social redeeming value standardthat thankfully still standsthose with an interest in the quirks of history will find this a mustsee<SEP>1
this movie is not that interesting except for the first ten minutes the pace and editing are a perfect introduction in an ensemble piece even better than say gosford park then it inexplicably slows down loses focus and starts resembling a traditional french movie only to regain focus in the end with the love relation between antoine depardieu and cécile deneuve in the middle there are too many sidelines and loose ends in the story several threads started are not ended*******spoilers ahead the main story is the relation between antoine and cécile he has been loyal to her after his relation with her many years ago despite her remarrying and setting up home in morocco as builder he now rebuilds his own life and recovers hers by taking the mask of céciles marriage having accomplished this he is buried after a freak accident literally and becomes a comatose he wakes only after she has burned their old picture as indication that theyve reconciled with the past and can properly start their lives again together *******end of spoilersit remains unclear what vision this director wants us to see us because there are so many other stories here: illegal immigrants want to enter europe there are frequent radio broadcasts about the overthrow of iraqs former regime céciles child is bisexual and is bitten by dogs loyalty once he meets his boyfriend whereas the girl he lives with seems to be sick of that her sister is traditional islamic and enters a relation with céciles husband it portrays morocco as unnecessary backward despite all the building there is a strange colonial vision shining through that almost glorifies the past it portrays islam as backward and prone to extremism which may sometimes be true but certainly not in general in the end it can all best be described as adding some couleur locale and lart pour lartdeneuve and depardieu are great with this material they are so familiar they are able to spin something extra in every scene: lifting an eyebrow body language radiating pride awkward behavior the movie itself is disappointing and only confirming the limited role of french cinema in the world nowadays with some notable exceptions of course<SEP>0
in the very first episode of friends which aired 22 sept 1994 the one where monica gets a roommate there is a song playing as rachel sits in the window towards the end of the show the line that plays is: if you ever need holding does anyone know the artist singing or the title of the song it is seems as if it is a great songi would love to get a copy of it thanks for the assistance i am looking for the albumcd it is on so i can purchase it i have the shows which are available for purchase and enjoy this show over and over again it just seemed to be believablethanks for the hours of entertainment you have provided over the years<SEP>1
ive read a few books about bonnie and clyde and this is definitely more accurate than the beattydunaway version in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang particularly well done is the death of buck barrow and the capture of his wife blanche this actress looks looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of blanche grieving over her dying husband however this movie is still hollywood and our anti-heroes stay pretty to the end even after being shot full of holes in life bonnie was badly burned in an auto accident the year before their famous ambush and did not look like a perky cheerleader at the time of her death the script is tedious and the acting is poor particularly the leads very disappointing stick with beatty and dunaway theirs may not be the true story but its a great film<SEP>0
silverlake life is a documentary and it was plain and straightforward actually it was more like a home movie and if you want dramatic illuminations see something else and its by no means a tearjerker but i mean that in positive ways it shows two men who love each other and how being afflicted with aids is affecting the quality of their every-day lives its almost difficult for me to say whether this was a quality film or not because it was so undressed that i had to look for other ways to respond its an admirable film actually one of the most admirable sincere documents ive ever seen these two men have incredible integrity as their lives are reduced to the most basic parts it makes hollow-wood productions on aids seem hip and heartless these men made this movie for themselves which is one of the best reasons to create something the scene where tom sings you are my sunshine to mark and tells him goodbye is the real thing<SEP>1
if youre at all interested in pirates pirate movies new orleansearly 19th century american history or yul brynner see this film for yourself and make up your own mind about it dont be put off by various lacklustre reviews my reaction to it was that it is entertaining well acted for the most part has some very witty dialogue and that it does an excellent job of portraying the charm appeal and legendary fascination of the privateer jean lafitte while not all the events in the film are historically accurate can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this i feel the film is accurate in its treatment of the role lafitte played in new orleans history and the love-hate relationship between the respectable citizens of new orleans and this outlaw who was one of the citys favorite sons dont worry about what the film doesnt do but watch it for what it does do ie for its study of one of new orleans and americas most intriguing historical figures<SEP>1

nintendo!!! you #%$@ers!!! how could you do this to me i cant believe itthis movie is actually worse than the first one i went to see this at the theatre with my brother because my mother forced me to tag alongoh godwhere do i even begin the plot sucked the voice acting sucked the animation sucked the ending really sucked if you liked this movie you suck too and to futuramafan1987 who said this was the greatest movie ever you are a tool plain and simple this isnt a movie for anyone but crack-addled ten-year olds with game boys who think pikachu is god im still cry to this day thinking about that horrible turd of a movieand then there was pikachus adventuredont even get me started on that horrible mess of a film it is in all truth one of the most boring experiences of my entire life dont go watch this at any costsbottom line: go out find every copy of this movie that you can and burn it burn them all and then proceed to rent a good movie like aliensor bowling for columbineor even back to the future!<SEP>0
this is a decent endeavor but the guy who wrote the screenplay seems to be a bit in the dark as to what exactly makes a zombie movie cool no it isnt cgi bugs and software companies actually im not sure whether it was a software company - i saw it without subtitles so i had to guess what theyre talking about anyway my point was - instead of wasting your time animating some dumb-ass bug why not throw in more zombies and more action 23 of the 20 minutes consist of news bulletins bugs some guys yelling about something and to makes matters worse more boring most of the deaths occur off-screen i realize thats all too common for no-budget movies but then there were some very impressive effects well kind-a of which left me wondering why did the director or screenwriter whatever chose to focus on how the epidemic started - its a short nobodys gonna care anyway<SEP>0
this wasnt what i wanted to see i bought this on dvd and under the movie i found myself irritated and turned off the movie for a momentheres what i didnt like:1 they were shooting at the father2 the tribes was really annoying3 the dinosaurs mostlylooked to faked4 the bad scientist well he was annoying5 the picture quality on the dvd was really badwhat i did like: 1 the music by jerry goldsmith this music is really great i have the bootleg soundtrack from this movie sadly the sound quality is not good but its ok for its time2 the first time we see the dinosaurs they inspire a sort of awe3 baby is kinda cute when he is in the water and is playing4 that funny scene with the tent 5 the children who sees this film would hopefully learn that evil always loses<SEP>0
i guess if a film has magic i dont need it to be fluid or seamless it can skip background information go too fast in some places too slow in others etc magic in this film: the scene in the library there are many minor flaws in stanley & iris yet they dont detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible the hardest to fix both characters are smart yet stanley cant understand enough to function because he cant read; he cant read because hes had too much adventure in his childhood iris although well-educated hasnt had enough adventure and so cant understand how to move past the u-turn her life took in both their faults and strengths the characters compliment each other it may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an iris would wind up working year after year in a factory or that a stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better-paying job and while these mysteries are explained in the course of the story their unfolding seems somewhat contrived i assume no one took the time to rethink the script even so its a good moviejust imagine what de niro fonda and plimpton would have done on screen if someone had!<SEP>1
this was awful andie macdowell is a terrible actress so wooden she makes a rocking horse look like it could do a better job but then remember that turn in four weddings equally as excruciating another film that portrays england as full of chocolate box cottages and village greens i mean that school how many schools apart from maybe hogwarts look like that the twee police station looked like the set from heartbeat a nauseating british series set in the 60sthis film just couldnt make its mind up what it wanted to be- a comedy or a serious examination of the undercurrents in womens friendships if it had stuck to the former then the graveyard sex scenes and the highly stupid storming of the wedding might just have worked i say just but those scenes just didnt work with the tragedy in the second half i also find it implausible that kate would ever speak to molly again after her terrible behaviour a final note- what is a decent actress like staunton doing in this pile of poo not to mention anna chancellor macdowell should stick to advertising wrinkle cream<SEP>0
this wasnt the major disaster that i was expecting but that is about as positive as i can be in my description of the movie im not sure what was meant to be funny about this movie but i suppose its all a matter of taste personally i dont find it funny to watch morons living their idiotic lives or making fools of themselves on television but then again im not a fan of jerry springers pathetic daytime talk show i didnt get too bored watching this but i was definitely never enjoying it either if youre in the mood to see a bad movie but one that isnt too painful to sit through this is a good choice<SEP>0
this is a film exploring the female sexuality in a way not so often used almost every other film with this kind of sexual scenes always becomes rated x and so seen as a pornographic movie here is a kind of romantic horror story combined with the females own satisfaction needa very good film!<SEP>1
howling ii 1985 was a complete 180 from the first film whilst the first film was campy and creepy the second one was sleazy and cheesy the production values on this one are pretty bad and the acting is atrocious the brother of the anchorwoman werewolf from part one wants to find out what happened to his sis the scene from the first film was badly re-created a skinny plain looking woman accompanies bro reb brown to the old country romania to uncover the mystery to her sisters murdertransformationdeath christopher lee appears and disappears over now and then as sort of a sageguide to the two sybil danning and her two biggest assets appear as stirba the head werewolf of the romania she also suffers from a bad case of morning face ewww!bad movie theres nothing good about this stinker im surprise philippe mora directed this picture because hes usually a good film-maker the film is so dark that you need a flashlight to watch it no not the content but the film stock itself to round the movie off you get a lousy punk performance from a damned wannabe babel maybe if they forked over a couple of extra bucks they couldve got the real deal instead of an imitationbest to avoid unless youre desperate or you lost the remote and youre too lazy to change the channel<SEP>0
elvis presley plays a half-breed native american indian who has to defend his reservation from nasty business tycoons everyone likes to get drunk fight and make children fighting wrestling and punching out each other replace the stereotypical hand-raised expression howalthough he does have make-up on its obvious elvis is healthier than he appeared in prior films; possibly he was getting ready for his famous comeback it couldnt have been because this movies script was anything to get excited about joan blondell trying to seduce elvis and burgess meredith in war paint should be ashamedthe best song is stay away actually green sleeves with different lyrics the most embarrassing song is elvis love song to the bull dominic there are some surreal scenes but it never becomes trippy enough to succeed in that genre; though stay away joe might provide some laughs if youre in the right moodotherwise stay away ** stay away joe 1968 peter tewksbury ~ elvis presley burgess meredith joan blondell<SEP>0
this show was great it wasnt just for kids which i thought at first it is for the whole familythe first season was mostly about the father looking after is two daughters and son he sadly passed away in season 2 i could believe it when i heard iti am clad they carried on with the show as that what would really happen in really life and i need to mention the goodbye episode it was so well made it must of be so hard for them to film this you could tell they were real tears in theirs eyes i am 24 year old male and this episode did make me cry me as i know how they felt as my father died when i was 13 years too just like royseason 2 and season 3 had great comedy in there also season 3 had some of my favorites such freaky friday secretsi still think the show was strong enough to go on i was disappointed that it ended it was one the best no it was the best family comedy show ever since home improvement and it could have been the next friendsit should never have ended but still love watching the repeats everyday<SEP>1
this batman movie isnt quite as good as batman mask of the phantasm and batman and mr freeze subzero but it is still a good installment to the batman cartoons i say it is equally good as batman beyond the movie this movie is good for all the same reasons the storyline is good not quite as good as the other ones but still pretty good it has lots of action in it the cartoon effects are good the voice of actors are really good such as kevin conroy as batman bruce wayne tara strong as barbra gordon efrem zimbalist jr eli marienthal as robin the villains are good such as kyra sedgwick as batwoman david ogden stiers as the pequin hector elizondo as bane so i am sure you will not be disappointed with batman mystery of the batwomen so make sure that you rent or buy batman mystery of the batwoman the movie because it is really goodoverall score: ******* out of ********** *** out of *****<SEP>1
i remember back when i was little when i was away at camp and we would campout under the stars there was always someone there that would have a good story to tell that involved the woods that surrounded us and they would always creep me out well when i found wendigo at the library i checked it out hoping to be one of those films that had a supernatural being haunting people in the woods much like the stories that were told at camp well much to my dismay i was so far from the truth wendigo is really bad the story starts of when a family of three is driving to their winter cabin which looks like your normal suburban home and nothing like a cabin in the woods and they run into a deer well it seems the local rednecks were actually hunting this particular deer and are pretty upset at our city folk the movie spends far too much time following the families everyday activities instead of getting to the point of the film it wasnt until about the last 15 minutes that we actually have some action involving the wendigo my suggestion is that you stay very far away this film it will leave you wanting your hour and a half back<SEP>0
skip mccoy richard widmark pick-pockets candys jean peters wallet which contains an important microfiche that is intended for the communist cause she is being followed by 2 federal agents that are waiting to pounce once she hands the microfiche over to her contact however skip steals the purse on the subway under everyones noses and so starts a hunt for him by both the police and joey richard kiley and candy who want the microfiche back skip can only be traced through moe thelma ritter who sells information on criminals it is made clear to skip that what he has stolen is important and both sides want the film but he intends to hold out for a high price this leads to joey hunting after him and a conflict between joey and jean who has fallen in love with skip joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to his boss its a well-acted film and it has a good beginning that gets you involved straight away its a bit unrealistic how jean peters immediately falls in love with widmark but this point is necessary as otherwise why would she later hold out from joey its a good film<SEP>1
yes it was a little low budget but this movie shows love! the only bad things about it was that you can tell the budget on this film would not compare to waterworld and though the plot was good the film never really tapped into its full potential! strong performances from everyone and the suspense makes it worthwhile to watch on a rainy night<SEP>1
i should have known when i looked at the box in the video store and saw lisa raye - to me shes the female ernie hudson aka le kiss of death for *any* movie its almost *guaranteed* the movie will be bad eg congoif hudson is in it with the exception of the ghostbusters films which were intentionally campy and bad despite my instincts and the fact that i just saw civil brand yet another cinematic tour de force starring lisa raye i rented it anyway after all i ignored my hudson instinct on oz and ended up watching a very quality series so i figured id give this movie a chanceif you are a lover of bad movies this is a definite must see! this has got to be the most unintentionally funny movie ive seen in a loooong time the plot is fairly straightforward: racheals monica calhoun sister is killed by a band of brigands led by bobby brown! and like many an action movie before this she straps on her guns one last time and vows to avenge her sisters death to do this she reassembles the titular gang of roses supposedly based on a true story of a female gang and they go out and exact revenge and along the way theres some subplot or something or other about some gold that might be buried in the town one nice thing i will say about this movie is that from what i could tell the stars did their own riding and they looked great gallopingthe funniest albiet unintentionally funny scenes look for when they introduce stacy dashs character or when calhouns character rescinds her vow not to strap on her guns replete with a clenched fisted cry to the heavens or lil kims character joking with lisa rayes character or stacy dashs character being killed or lil kims character convincing lisa rayes character to rejoin the gang or the asian chick or macy greys character talking bout the debt is paid etc with the exception of calhouns racheal and bobby browns left-eye i cant even remember the names of the other characters cuz i was laughing so hard when they were introducedif the director had gone for parody and broad comedy this would have been a great movie unfortunately he tries to take it seriously seemingly without first taking exposition sound design in his defense hip-hop is notoriously difficult to work into a period piece set design script writing nor period historical research was it meor were these the cleanest people with the whitest teeth in the old west seriously usually when i see a movie thats not so good i ask myself could you have done any better this is the first time in a long time where the answer is an unequivocal yes!<SEP>0

here was no effort put into valentine to prevent it from being just another teenage slasher film a sub-genre of horror films of which we have seen entirely too many over the last decade or so ive heard a lot of people complaining that the film rips off several previous horror movies including everything from halloween to prom night to carrie and as much as i hate to be redundant the rip off is so blatant that it is impossible not to say anything the punch bowl over poor jeremys head early in the film is so obviously taken from carrie that they may as well have just said it right in the movie `hey everyone this is the director and the following is my carrie-rip-off scene enjoy! but thats just a suggestionspoilers the film is structured piece by piece exactly the same way that every other goofy teen thriller is structured we get to know some girl briefly at the beginning she gets killed people wonder in the old oh-but-that-stuff-only-happens-to-other-people tone and then they start to get killed the problem here is that the director and the writers clearly and honestly want to keep the film mysterious and suspenseful but they have no idea how to do it take jason for example here is this hopelessly arrogant guy who is so full of himself and bad with women that he divides the check on a date according to what each person had and as one of the first characters seen in the film after the brief history lesson about how bad poor jeremy was treated he is assumed to carry some significance besides that and more importantly he has the same initials as the little boy that all the girls terrorized in sixth grade and the same initials that are signed at the bottom of all of those vicious valentines day cards it is not uncommon for the audience to be deliberately and sometimes successfully misled by the behavior of one or more characters that appear to be prime suspects and jason is a perfect example of the effort but not such a good example of a successful effort sure i thought for a while that he might very well be the killer but thats not the point we know from early on that he is terrible with women which links him to the little boy at the beginning of the film but then in the middle of the film he appears at a party smiles flirtatiously at two of the main girls and then gives them a hateful look and walks away disappearing from the party and from the movie with no explanation we already know he is a cardboard character but his role in the film was so poorly thought out that they just took him out altogether when they were done with himon the positive side the killers true identity was in fact made difficult to predict in at least one subtle way which was also unfortunately yet another rip-off early in the film when shelley stabs the killer in the leg with his own scalpel he makes no sound suggesting that the killer might be a female staying silent to prevent revealing herself as a female rather than a male as everyone suspects but then for the rest of the film we just have this stolid relentless unstoppable killer with the emotionless mask and that gigantic butcher knife director jamie blanks who with all due respect looks like he had some trouble with the girls himself in the sixth grade mentions being influenced by halloween this is of course completely unnecessary because its so obvious from how badly he plagiarizes the film the only difference between the killer in valentine and michael meyers is that michaels mask was so much more effective and he didnt have a problem with nosebleeds this stuff is shameless at the end there is a brief attempt to mislead us one more time as to who the killer is complete with slow and drawn out `and-the-killer-is mask removal but then we see adams nose start to bleed as he holds kate his often reluctant girlfriend and we know that hes been the killer all along nothing in the film hinted that he might be the killer until the final act and these unexplained nosebleeds were not exactly the cleverest way to identify the true killer at the end of the film valentine is not scary i watched it in an empty house by myself after midnight and i have been afraid of the dark for as long as i can remember and even i wasnt scared and the characters might be possible to care about if it werent so obvious that they were just going to die i remember being impressed by the theatrical previews although the film was in and out of the theaters faster than battlefield earth but the end result is the same old thing<SEP>0
there are many reasons to watch this movie: to see the reality that whips latin america with regard to the kidnappings thing the police corruption at continental level among so many realities that we live the latins the performance of denzel wahington was brilliant this guy continues being an excellent actor and that it continues this way dakota fanning just by 10 years an excellent actress has become and i congratulate her the rest of the movie was of marvel i have it in my collection i hope that they are happened to those producing of hollywood to make a movie completely in venezuela where they show our reality better with regard to the delinquency the traffic of drugs or the political problems they have been few the movies that they play venezuelan land for example: aracnophobia jungle 2 jungle dragonfly they should make more as well as they make in mexicothe song una mirada i hope that it leaves in the soundtrack it is excellent my vote is 1010<SEP>1
i think cliff robertson certainly was one of our finest actors he has a half dozen classics to his credit he does fine here as the heavy but the direction is so bad and the pacing so tiresome it never gets off the mark the story starts off well although it makes me wonder how he could count on his wife hanging herself still he mugs well and carries things along the death knell is twofold first of all if we were to take the amount of time characters spend walking from one room to another or one part of the house to another it would eat up about a third of the movie add to that robertsons character sitting up in bed in the blue light looking confused that might add another chunk i agree with those that said a half hour shorter would have made it a pretty decent though insignificant film the biggest weakness is just a convoluted plot that when all is said and done leaves incredible questions im not putting in spoilers but when it ends dont think too much i can come up with ten what-ifs without raising a sweat it would have been better if it had remained a ghost story<SEP>0
whether you want to spend nearly 2 hours of your life watching this depends how you like your horror movies if you like them so god damn awful theyre hysterical watch away jigsaw is without a doubt the worst movie ive seen in my life and ive seen long time dead and i say this as a fan of the low-budget horrorgore genre and having seen a good few to compare it to im not even going to go into the specifics of what makes this movie was bad as it is the only good thing about it is its so so terrible its one of the funniest things ive seen in years if you can find this to rent cheap its definitely worth watching if you were involved in making it - shame on you :o imdb need to introduce a 010 ranking especially for this movie it thoroughly deserves it<SEP>0

during the cheap filmed in video beginning of crazy fat ethel ii i wondered if it was the same film that was on the cover unfortunately it was the story itself is mindlessly simple ethel a homicidal maniac with an eating disorder is released into a halfway house because of hospital overcrowding she is by far the most sane resident watching while one man puts dead flies into anothers soup ethel is then teased by one of the halfway house employees with a chocolate bar after he hits on the cost cutting measure of feeding the residents dog food ethel retaliates by strangling him with a wire noose on the stairs and thenwell you get the idea if this all sounds like fun it isnt this film was poorly made with cheap effects and even worse acting the characters are so wooden when delivering their lines that they should be standing out in front of a cigar store to make matters worse half of the film consists of flashbacks to the first ethel movie criminally insane which is little better a very poor effort<SEP>0
casting unknown michelle rodriguez as diana was a stroke of genius shes perfect her acting inexperience actually works in her favor weve never seen her before so it really feels like her story she also brings across genuine toughness this works against her though because we never doubt her you never have to cheer for her to win because she never goes up against any fighter we dont think she can beat so as a boxing movie it failsthen again this isnt really a boxing movie how do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer that isnt a boxing movie you dont but karyn kusama has anyway like many indie films girlfight defies classification or genre and stands on its own as folklore that could darn near happen in real lifediana is doing poorly in school she beats up people she doesnt like all the other girls in her school for example she doesnt fit in her father is forcing her kid brother tiny to learn to box so he can defend himself when things get tough he gives tiny money for his boxing sessions and gives diana nothing as if she has no need to defend herself nor anything worthwhile to make of her life tiny wants to go to art school cliche yuck so he gives up his boxing allowance to diana who actually wants to box things get complicated when diana falls for another boxer adrian santiago douglas whos looking to turn pro from there the story winds down toward the inevitablethe two meet in the amateur title fightwhat left me cold was that i never found any of this all that interesting its all just a bit too believable kids with tough lives growing up in rough urban areas fall back on sports a lot of professional boxers have risen from these circumstances the mental and physical toughness this upbringing requires lends itself to a game like boxing where anger is your friend so this time its a girl big dealor theres another position to take: finally a boxing movie about a girl womens boxing has been around a long time the brutality we usually see in boxing films is replaced here by discussions of peoples their lives and their feelings the whole fighting thing is used as a platform from which to paint a larger picture respect overcoming adversity self-discoveryi recommend girlfight because it has a good spirit and is an example of some great work by a first time director the dialogue never rises above soap opera quality but the story itself actually changed my view on some things yes the world now seems like a better place a film did thatgrade: b-<SEP>1
the guy did a lot of title design for a bunch of movies and i guess one day he said; i should pick a cheap scenario try to put as much title in it as a can cause after all im a title designer and try to persuade people that this is in fact a movie one of the worst ive even seen thats for sure if you fell the urge to see nice titles go check out some posters dont waste your time watching thisit kinda ironic dont you think did you saw the poster the only part of his project that should had title work done have almost none !<SEP>0
there is nothing unique in either the tv series nor the movie which is a prequel to the tv show that isnt found everywhere else in life and entertainment both before david lynches disgusting style of story telling and after from the moment the body of a poor misguided girl washed up on the beach and being introduced to some of the most mind numbing shady immoral character of the twin peaksto the mind numbing almost pedophilia disgusting way the movie seems to romantically tell of the destruction of a human life through some random psychedelic phenomena in the movie twin peak:fire come walk with me i watched it all just to make sure i wasnt missing anything i didnt its is simply one mans obvious sexual fetish extended over long series fallowed by a ridiculous overly pornographic movie save your self the agony the suspense and watch anything else that at least has the ability to tell a story rather then seduce you into some kind mental porn moviei have heard a lot of reviews rants and raves about how great david lynch because of his ability to define misery and and tragedy and making it into some kind of a wonderful thing this is not life imitating art as much as it is some sick twisted version of art doing its best to inspire complete mindless lifedo yourself a favor and avoid this garbage<SEP>0
spoilers all too often hollywoods shakespeare adaptations entertaining pieces of cinema beautifully shot they are well performed and faithful to the text films including branaghs henry v and 1993s much ado about nothing are powerful pieces of work watching loves labours lost therefore its such a huge disappointment for expectation to be so hideously thrown to waste sadly loves labours lost is awful! the king of navarre alessandro nivola and his friends have forsaken drink and women for three years to focus on their studies plans begin to fall apart however when the enigmatic princess of france alicia silverstone and her entourage arrive soon love is in the air and philosophy is off the princes mindfrom the start you realise that this film is not quite shakespeare cleverly relocated into a 1930s musical by ken branagh the plot is still there and the script remains but now it has been sacrificed in favour of dire musical taste classics like the way you look tonight lets face the music and dance im in heaven are all destroyed by weak singing and a strong feel that they just dont belong hereaside from weak singing we are also treated to an increasingly large number of awkward performances by regular stars ken branagh and friends might enjoy making this film but they provide us with a stomach turning collection of rolesthe main eight actors four men & four women are all equally dire and the only positive on their behalf is a vast improvement on the truly dreadful timothy spallin fact only one individual leaves the film worthy of any praise and thats the consistently magnificent nathan lane lane has proved over the years that he is a comedy genius and in this feature he once again adds an air of humour to the jester costardtheres little else to be said really loves labours lost deserves mild praise for branaghs original take on an old tale unfortunately though thats where the positives end weakly acted performed sang and constructed loves labours lost is perhaps the weakest shakespeare adaptation of the last forty years it should be avoided like the plague and should never have been made a poor disappointing choice by branagh and heres hoping his next effort is better<SEP>0
i came to new port south expecting a surrogate movie about the columbine school massacre similar to gus van sants elephant and certainly the synopsis in the tv guide stating that a student sociopath rebels against the system did give me that impression but this is a very boring movie where little happens so consider yourself warned the story is about maddox a chicago high school student who decides to strike back at what he perceives to be an authoritarian regime the major problem is that the character is underwritten and the actor who plays him blake shields is unable to embellish any script deficiencies you have the gut feeling that maddox should have the evil charisma of hitler saddam or bin laden but he never comes across as anything more than a petulant truculent teenager and its impossible to believe he could rally any disciples the subtext of you overthrow one manipulative authoritarian regime only to replace it with another manipulative regime is too obvious which means new port south is an entirely unconvincing drama thats not worth going out of your way to see<SEP>0
god i was bored out of my head as i watched this pilot i had been expecting a lot from it as im a huge fan of james cameron and not just since titanic i might add and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality then again he also wrote the leaden strange days but the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration in all that time it barely went beyond its two line synopsis and i would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere on top of that i dont think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular a-team episode as for alba yes she is gorgeous of course but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie pouty and surly makes me also get bored of her gal wit an attitude schtick pretty soon you can count me out of this one mr cameron!<SEP>0
i dont know why some guys from us georgia or even from bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about something they dont understand at all for those who did not watch this movie - watch it dont expect too much or dont put some frameworks just because this is kosturica watch the movie without prejudice try to understand the whole humor inside - people of serbia did actually getting married while bil clinton bomb their villages gypsies in all balkans are always try to f*ck you up in any way they can love is always unexpected pure and colorful and balkans are extremely creative for those who claims this is a bad movie i can see only that the americans sh*t like meet dave get smart etc are much much worse than a pure frank balkan humoristic love story movie as promise me the comment should be useful and on second place should represent the personal view of the writer i think the movie is great and people watch it must give their respects to the director and story told inside it is simple but true it is brutal but gentle and makes you laugh to dead<SEP>1
this movie makes a statement about joseph smith what he stood for and what the lds church believes with all the current media coverage of a certain fugitive people have confused the lds church with the flds church and criminal fugitive warren jeffs jeffs is not associated with the lds church yet media groups internationally have asked for comments about jeffs from the lds church jeffs is not mentioned in the movie at all but i think that it is ironic that this movie with all its points about joseph also point away from the fews of the flds church and their leader at this time in the media world this is a movie about joseph smith and a great one at that some of the most obvious differences between jeffs and joseph is portrayed in josephs humanity acceptance and love jeffs views and opinions differ greatly from joseph smith and the lds church and it is seen in this movie jeffs thinks of the negro as devils joseph smith knew they were children of god and gave up his wifes favorite horse to a african american former slave to buy his sons freedom joseph is shown doing housework for his wife emma and is criticized by a member until joseph tells him that a man may lose his wife in the next life if she chooses not to stay with her husband and that doing chores is a way to help and cherish your wife jeffs brought one of his polygamist wives to her knees in front of a class full of students by grabbing her braid and twisting it painfully till she came to her knees lastly joseph participated with law enforcement and sought aid from the government at all times jeffs thumbs his nose at government and flees at all timesi loved this movie and if you dont know much about joseph smith and what the lds church believes then this is the movie to see and if you had confused the lds church with the flds church then you really need to get your act together we are not much different from anyone who believes in jesus christ the sanctity of marriage and the family as well a patriotic to our homeland and country we are all different as well just like you can find different protestants presbyterians methodist baptist and catholics whats important is our message and what we stand for this movie trys to portray that but there is so much of josephs life that cant be covered in a mere 2 hour movie this was a really great show<SEP>1
a really very bad movie with a very few good moments or qualitiesit starts off with pregnant linda blair who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks im not sure she jumps through a window and wakes up and we see she is very pregnant the degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movieshe and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who i thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies! on the island already are david hasselhoff and his german-speaking virgin girlfriend you know how germans are said to love hasselhoff hes taking photographs and shes translating an esoteric german book about witches i thinkalso traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it and a real estate agent and a woman i thought was their daughter evidently she was an architect and linda blair and the boy are the older couples children i guess they all traveled to the island together but it really seemed like linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them maybe they were filmed separatelythe hotel seems neat certainly from the exteriors but it isnt used to any great effect an old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in german sometimes which he eventually records on his sesame street tape recorderpeople start getting killed either in their dreams or sucked into hell or something some of these gore scenes are ok but not enough to recommend the movie though the copy i watched stated it is uncut on the box cover the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut much of the scene is showing another characters reaction shots since were not seeing anything ourselves the creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messy-looking wound of a mouth rapes someone he looked particularly nasty theres a laughably and painfully bad scene in which linda blair is possessed i wish if a horror movie is going to cast her they would do something original with her role and let her leave exorcist behind her except for the yearly horror conventionsin the weird largely italian tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to this is also aka la casa 4 and ghosthouse 2 that is it is supposedly a sequel to casa 3 - ghosthouse la 1988 - its not thats also a better movie than this one la casa 1 and two were the evil dead 1981 and evil dead ii 1987 - again unrelated to witchery and la casa 3 and much better than those theres also a casa 5 la 1990 aka house 5 which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake la casa series and the series house: house 1986 house ii: the second story 1987 the horror show 1989 aka house iii and house iv 1992 hows the horror show fit in there it doesnt really it claimed to be a sequel thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less or more confusion oddly the horror show is also aka horror house and la casa 5 is also aka horror house 2 does your head hurt yet<SEP>0
absolutely one of the worst movies of all timelow production values terrible story idea bad script lackluster acting and i cant even come up with an adjective suitably descriptive for how poor joan rivers directing is i know that theres a special place in hell for the people who financed this film; prolly right below the level reserved for child-raping genocidal maniacsthis movie is a trainwreckterrible x infinity = rabbit testavoid this at all costsits so bad it isnt even funny how bad it is<SEP>0
this is a strong movie from a historical and epic perspective while the story is simple it is pure and straightforward in truth it is the standard story of a simple honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and wealthier men of the periodpoor vs rich honorable vs dishonorable a classic but well-told tale without much of the glitz of hollywood stinking up the screenextra points just because you can almost smell the people on the screen :<SEP>1
a long film about a very important character from south africa stephen biko he is one of these blacks who did not survive apartheid who actually died a long time before their normal time the already old film though does not show how important biko was what he really represented his life and his teaching is reduced to little at best a few witty remarks the film being from 1987 the objective was to push south africa over the brink that would lead her to liberation so the film aims at showing how irrational the south african supporters of apartheid are in 1987 to show this the film has to look beyond bikos death hence to center its discourse not on biko but on a white liberal journalist and his escaping the absurd system in which he is living his escape is made necessary because of the victimization he is the victim of along with his family and because he wants to publish the first book on biko after his death and that can only happen in england the film shows a way to escape south africa while apartheid is still standing and killing so do not expect this way to be realistic and true it could not be but the film has tremendously aged because it does not show south africa with any historical distantiation the very distantiation that has taken place under nelson mandelas presidency and that is called forgiveness provided those who want to be forgiven speak up and out the film is strong and emotional but that very historical limit makes it rather weak today especially since the film does not mention the third racial community the indians panegyric books or films all have that defect: they are looking at the person they are supposed to portrait from only one point of view that explains why the film has aged so much seems to be coming from so long ago as if nothing had changed at all a remake is necessarydr jacques coulardeau university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines cegid<SEP>1
this is one of the better comedies that has ever been on television season one was hilarious as were most of the following seasons the only reason that i give this show a 910 is because of the unfortunate final season the only good part of the final season was the finale my favorite part of this show was the scenes that cut to peoples imaginations often depicting the characters in famous tv shows or movies from the 70s it is a rare show in that i liked every character with the exception of the final seasontoo late to try to develop a new character and fez wasnt nearly as funny reds foot in your ass comments never got old nor did kelsos stupidity bravo to fox for keeping such a good show so long too long even<SEP>1
if you liked roman polanskis repulsion you should probably check out the tenant since its a similar concept just with polanski stepping in and playing the schizophrenic wacko this is actually one of my favorites of his movies - second after rosemarys baby of course - and is a straight forward journey into the mental collapse of a man who moves into the former apartment of a suicide victim the other residents of the building are all flaky and sticklers on keeping the noise level down - even the slightest titter becomes a big deal and polanski who stars becomes increasingly paranoid and succumbs to his loony hallucinations further and further as the film carries on it gets to the point where he is dressing and acting like the former tenant and you realize its only a matter of time before he decides tor re-enact her fatal leap out the window the film is a bit slow and dawdling for a while but if you have ever seen a roman polanski movie you should know its going to end with a bang and this flick doesnt disappoint its also best if you dont question the intricacies of the premise and just take it as a descent into madness because its pretty trippy surreal at times polanski is very good as the timid deranged resident who somehow attracts the ever illustrious isabelle adjani we also get to see him running around in drag which is disturbing and hilarious all at the same time! damn he makes for one ugly chick! so polanski fans - who can actually look past his thirty year-old pedophile charges - should enjoy the tenant as an entertaining psychological head-trip<SEP>1
back in 1985 i caught this thing i cant even call it a movie on cable i was in college and i was with a high school friend whose hormones were raging out of control i figured out early on that this was hopeless stupid script a bunch of old guys hiring some young guys to show them how to score with women bad acting with one exception and pathetic jokes the plentiful female nudity here kept my friend happy for a while--but even he was bored after 30 minutes in remember--this was a high school boy! this was back before nudity was so easy to get to by the internet and such we kept watching hoping for something interesting or funny but that never happened the funniest thing about this was the original ad campaign in which the studio admitted this film was crap! one poster had a fictional review that said this is the best movie ive seen this afternoon! only grant cramer in the lead showed any talent and has actually gone on to a career in the business no-budget and boring t&a skip it<SEP>0
i hired this movie expecting a few laughs hopefully enough to keep me amused but i was sorely mistaken this movie showed very minimal moments of humour and the pathetic jokes had me cringing with shame for ever hiring it aimed at an age group of 10-15 this movie will certainly leave viewers outside of these boundaries feeling very unsatisfied worth no more than 3 votes highly unrecommended for anyone not wanting to waste 2 hours of their lives<SEP>0
robert forster normally a very strong character actor is lost at sea here cast as a new york family man seeking revenge on the thugs who murdered his son and attacked his wife in a home invasion scary subject matter exploited for cheapjack thrills in the death wish vein it isnt difficult to scoff at these smarmy proceedings: the dialogue is full of howlers the crime statistics are irrevocably dated and the supporting characters are ridiculously over-written particularly a despicable judge who allows an accused murderer to walk right out of the courtroom low-rent production is contemptible in its self-righteousness especially as the violence in our cities has only increased * from ****<SEP>0
cartoon network seems to be desperate for ratings beginning with the cancellation of samurai jack the network seemed hellbent on removing all the shows that made it so popular such as the powerpuff girls dexters lab dragonball z etc when the ratings started to plummet cn began putting up some pretty mediocre shows though total drama islandaction and chowder stand out because of their clever writing and audience-pleasing gimmicks there are plenty of other shows that either terrible remakes george of the jungle or rip offs of other shows such as the marvelous misadventures of flapjack where the title character acts just like spongebob and then theres johnny test which is something of a replacement for dexters laboratory though its much more of a sheer rip off than anythingthe shows characters are clearly derived from dexters lab only this time the focus is on johnny a blonde or fiery-haired character who torments his twin sisters susan and mary who just happen to look just like dexter from the orange hair to the glasses the impossible technology there is even a rival genius named bling bling boy or eugene who appears to be sitting in for mandark then theres dookie johnnys best friend and talking dog one of dextersi mean susan and marys early experimentsdexters laboratory was probably one of the best cartoons on television with its simple but effective art style lovable main character and episodes that dont seem to be a long drag johnny test is a lot different the art style here isnt nearly as eye-pleasing in fact it looks absolutely awful the characters have motivations that make them really annoying or repulsive like how most of the series episodes consist johnny and dookies quest for havoc on the neighborhood girl sissy whom johnny secretly likes or the twins obsession over a boy next door seeing these two geniuses swoon at the sight of abs and the fact that johnny appears to be someone you would never want to associate with there is no real connection between the viewer and charactersone thing the series heavily exploits in its name is that johnny is susan and marys guinea pig for their experiments these range from turning johnny fat ugly monstrous and even into a woman the twins then help johnny in whatever scheme hes planning in return for his services whenever theres an episode involving this kind of winwin deal it usually comes undone at the seems and those that doesnt come completely off the rails never ends satisfyinglythe writing ranges from mediocre to horrid however the fat episode constantly repeats its phat with a ph theres a difference you know which is a line that should never be repeated especially when the episode seems to promote child obesity with johnny becoming a famous star with money and videogames just by becoming fatlets talk about how the show doesnt completely rip off dexters lab the show tosses in a lot of characters from two men-in-black named mr black and mr white a military general who seems to need all his problems solved through johnny and his sisters and lots of super villains though even here the show again steals ideas for other sources like a mr freeze teenage clone an evil cat with a butler who wants cats to rule over man like the evil talking cat from powerpuff girls a bumbling maniac mastermind a trio of evil skater dudes and even a mole man which is probably the most cliché villain in the mediato top it all off alongside its ugly animation and unlikeable characters the voice acting is either passable like the voices for mr black and mr white to just plain ear-splitting johnny dookie and just about every villain in the show the theme song seems to be the only catchy thing to this show but then it was redone just a few episodes with a band that just ruined itso in the end johnny test is not a good cartoon its horrible references and jokes about teen culture will dismantle little childrens interest in the show while its bright coloring ripped-off characters and dragging episodes will ruin the experience for teens its just another one of those crappy shows that cartoon network is over-promoting to trick people to watching it like mtv toward rap if you need a show that will satisfy your children for a half hour youd better stick to spongebob because johnny test is more of a test of patience than anything else<SEP>0
what a shame that a really competent director like andre de toth who specialized in slippery shifting alliances didnt get hold of this concept first he could have helped bring out the real potential especially with the interesting character played by william bishop as the movie stands its pretty much of a mess as asserted by reviewer chipe the main problems are with the direction cheap budget and poor script the strength lies in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept-- characters pulled in different directions by conflicting forces what was needed was someone with vision enough to pull together the positive elements by reworking the script into some kind of coherent whole instead of the sprawling awkward mess that it is try to figure out the motivations and interplay if you can also a bigger budget could have matched up contrasting location and studio shots and gotten the locations out of the all-too-obvious la outskirts the real shame lies in a waste of an excellent cast-- hayden taylor before his teeth were capped dehner reeves along with james millican and william bishop shortly before their untimely deaths few films illustrate the importance of an auteur-with-vision more than this lowly obscure western which in the right hands could have been so much more<SEP>0
knights was just a beginning of a series a pilot one might say the plot i really shouldnt call it that there wasnt any plot wasnt logical at all and there were many mistakes like [warning im summarizing the plot]:in the beginning of the movie someone said that there was only a couple of those cyborgs the bad guys but after the climax nea found out that there were many many more left of them and it was told that cyborgs were hard to kill but after a months training nea could kill them with a single blowthe movie was just pure kicking i wasnt surprised at all when i found out that the leading star was a kick boxerthere was one positive thing in the whole movie: it really gave a great deal of laughter when watching it and talking about it with my friends i recommend watching it if you are in need of laughter<SEP>0
i remember seeing this in a the salem movie theater where i used to attend kiddie matinées almost every saturday in dayton ohio when i was a young boy and have never forgotten it it simply amazed me and my friends i do wish there were some way i could see it again! i have tried to find some compilation of shorts or something like that to no avail i only recently discovered that it was a cousteau film and that blew my mind even more how the heck he accomplished this is beyond my understanding the fish is actually in the cats mouth at one point if i remember correctly! if anyone could help me find a way to see it again i would be extremely grateful!<SEP>1

the movie gung ho!: the story of carlsons makin island raiders was made in 1943 with a view to go up the moral of american people at the duration of second world war it shows with the better way that the cinema can constitute body of propaganda the value of this film is only collection and no artistic in a film of propaganda it is useless to judge direction and actors watch that movie if you are interested to learn how propaganda functions in the movies or if you are a big fun of robert mitchum who has a small role in the film if you want to see a film for the second world war they exist much better and objective i rated it 410<SEP>0
60 minutes in the beautiful christina galbo tries to escape the isolated boarding school shes brought to at the beginning of the movie is she running from some kind of fate too horrible to contemplate a monster black-gloved killer or supernatural evil no shes running from a bunch of bullies for the other 40 minutes that follow various figures walk around the school in the dark holding candelabras and looking alarmed or distraught which doesnt say much in itself perhaps because great movies have been made about just that but if youre going to have characters walking around corridors and staircases you better be alain resnais or you better know how to light that staircase in bright apple reds and purples like mario bava we know a killer stalks the perimeters of the school but his body count is pitiful and sparse and in the absence of the visceral horrors one expects to find in the giallo we get no sense of sinister mysteriesunspeakable secrets festering behind a facade of order and piety and rightness which is the kind of movie la residencia wants to be but doesnt quite know how to do it we know something is off because girls are reported missing but we never get the foreboding mysterious atmosphere that says something is seriously f-cking wrong here man when serrador tries to comment on the sexual repression of the female students he does so with quick-cutting hysterics and detail closeups of eyes and parted lips while high pitched this-is-shocking music blares in the background none of the aetherial beauty and longing of picnic at hanging rock to be found here its all a bit clumsy and aimless with no real sense of urgency or direction a number of people are presented as suspects but theres little reason to care for the identity of a killer that goes unnoticed by the characters inside the movie i like the first kill the image of a knife hitting target superimposed over the anguished face of the victim as a lullaby chimes in the background but the rest is too inconsequential for my taste i have to say serrador did much better with the killing children and paranoia du soleil of who can kill a child<SEP>0
nacho vigalondo is very famous in spain he is a kind of bad showman who can make you feel sick very embarrassing nacho had made some commercials in tv i remember one in which nacho was looking for paul mc carney around madrid the commercial was about a mc carney cd collection this little movie is like a nachos commercial: bad storyline bad directing and awful performances i cant believe that a disgusting movie like this was in the kodak theater poor oscarnacho could made this movie because of his wife the producer of this 7:35 a woman very well connected with spanish tv business men<SEP>0
i would say that this film gives an insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster i would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a familyi found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a multitude of dimensionsthe scary monster although probably not scary to most adults has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might createi found the film to be delightful!<SEP>1
set in the cameroons in west africa in the 1950s claire denis chocolat is a beautifully photographed and emotionally resonant tone poem that depicts the effects of a dying colonialism on a young family during the last years of french rule the theme is similar to the recent nowhere in africa though the films are vastly different in scope and emphasis the film is told from the perspective of an adult returning to her childhood home in a foreign country france dalens mireille perrier a young woman traveling through cameroon recalls her childhood when her father francois cluzet was a government official in the french cameroons and she had a loving friendship with the brooding manservant protée isaach de bankolé the heart of the film however revolves around frances mother aimée giulia boschi and her lovehate relationship with protée that is seething with unspoken sexual tension the household is divided into public and private spaces the white families rooms are private and off limits to all except protée who works in the house while the servants are forced to eat and shower outdoors exposing their naked bronze bodies to the white familys gazes it becomes clear when her husband marc françois cluzet goes away on business that aimée and protée are sexually attracted to each other but the rules of society prevent it from being openly acknowledged in one telling sequence she invites him into her bedroom to help her put on her dress and the two stare at each others image in the mirror with a defiant longing in their eyes knowing that any interaction is taboo the young france cecile ducasse also forms a bond with the manservant feeding him from her plate while he shows her how to eat crushed ants and carries her on his shoulders in walks beneath the nocturnal sky in spite of their bond the true nature of their master-servant relationship is apparent when france commands protée to interrupt his conversation with a teacher and immediately take her home and when protée stands beside her at the dinner table waiting for her next command when a plane loses its propeller and is forced to land in the nearby mountains the crew and passengers must move into the compound until a replacement part can be located each visitor shows their disdain for the africans one a wealthy owner of a coffee plantation brings leftover food from the kitchen to his black mistress hiding in his room another luc jean-claude adelin an arrogant white frenchman upsets the racial balance when he uses the outside shower eats with the servants and taunts aimée about her attraction to protée leading her to a final emotional confrontation with the manservantchocolat is loosely autobiographical adapted from the childhood memories of the director and is slowly paced and as mysterious as the brooding isolation of the land on which it is filmed denis makes her point about the effects of colonialism without preaching or romanticizing the characters there are no victims or oppressors no simplistic good guys protée is a servant but he is also a protector as when he stands guard over the bed where aimée and her daughter sleep to protect them from a rampaging hyena it is a sad fact that protée is treated as a boy and not as a man but bankolé imbues his character with such dignity and stature that it lessens the pain because of its pace western audiences may have to work hard to fully appreciate the film and denis does not in roger eberts phrase coach our emotions the truth of chocolat lies in the gestures and glances that touch the silent longing of our heart<SEP>1
truly this is a heart-warming film it won the george peobody award winning over roots so that may tell you something of the essence of this film i am looking on the internet how to order this movie since my former father-in-law eugene logan the co-writer of this film has been deceased for a few years now so i no longer have the opportunity to receive information from him i would love to have his only grand-daughters my daughters see this film as well as to pass this wonderful story on to his great-grandsons my oldest daughter was seven years old at the time it was aired on television and i since have been looking forward to seeing it again one of my friends said it was her favorite movie i wont spoil this movie for you<SEP>1
henri verneuils film may be not so famous as parallax view 3 days of the condor or jfk but it is certainly not worse and sometimes even better than these classic representatives of the genre action takes place in fictional western state where fictional president has been killed after several years of investigation special government commission decides that president was killed by a lone gunman but one man - prosecutor volney played by yves montand - thinks theres something more to be investigated and so the film starts this movie doesnt deal with some exact theories but it embraces the whole structure of relationship between government and society in todays world such film could be made only in the 1970-ies but it will never lose its actuality furthermore its even a bit frightful how precise are its oracles 10 out of 10<SEP>1
when originally screened in america in 1972 the night stalker became the highest rated made-for-tv movie in history based on jeff rices unpublished novel it told how a fearless investigative reporter named carl kolchak the late darren mcgavin discovered the existence of a vampire in modern-day las vegas when it arrived on british television four years later it did not quite have the same impact but my friends were talking about it at school on monday morning as indeed was i we all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things we had seen i did not know of the existence of the night strangler until it turned up nearly a decade later itv who screened the kolchak movies had apparently decided to pass on the spin-off series; they felt barnaby jones starring buddy ebsen to be more of a draw and anyway viewers might confuse kolchak with kojak! for years my only source of information concerning the show was an article in fangoria magazine i could not even purchase the jeff rice novelsthen something wonderful happened in 1990 bbc-2 put out the show as part of a late-night friday series devoted to the supernatural called mystery train hosted by richard obrian kolchak found himself rubbing shoulders with the likes of the brain eaters and earth vsthe spider the opening titles were trimmed removing kolchaks whistling and the closing creditswell there were nonethe first episode screened was werewolf i cannot say i was overly impressed but stuck with it and am i glad that i did!i really wish id seen it in 1974 my twelve year old self would have adored it creepy humorous exciting no wonder it fired chris carters imagination the shows biggest asset was of course mcgavin unlike the recent kolchak the original was an everyman figure eccentrically dressed rather conservative he was to the supernatural what columbo was to crime the late simon oakland was great too as kolchaks bad-tempered boss tony vincenzo the scripts overflowed with wonderful dry wit i found myself enjoying the programme more for the humour content than the horror when the twenty episodes ended i felt bereftthe x-files came along a few years later and filled the void - but only to an extent i wanted kolchak and vincenzo back i am glad that the show was never revived though without oakland it would not have been the samei have the rice books now and have read them several times i was very surprised when stephen king slated the first in his book danse macabre as it is as good as anything he has written alright so some of the monsters were hardly state-of-the-art but so what the new kolchak totally missed the point of the original what you dont see is sometimes more frightening than what you dobest episode - horror in the heights worst episode - the sentry<SEP>1
i get tired of my 4 and 5 year old daughters constantly being subjected to watch nickelodeon disney and the like it all seems to be the same old tired cartoons rehashed over and over again when my daughters couldnt go to the fair this afternoon because one of them was sick i wanted them to just relax and rest for a while i flipped the tv on and in searching for something different i flipped the channels my finger stopped channel surfing the moment i heard harveys voice i adore every single solitary thing this man has done and when i saw that he was doing voice-over work for a little duck well i couldnt change the channel! my daughters were instantly mesmerized by the cartoon and the more we watched the show together the more i grew to love it along with the message that was being portrayed its not necessarily a proponent for gay rights but rather for anyone who has ever been ostracized as a child for anything i had friends who were picked on for one thing or another too fat too skinny too feminine being a bully not being smart enough only having one parent you name it! kids as a rule can be very very cruel to one another so i was happy to see an entertaining cartoon that actually conveyed a life message to its audience my girls already accept others as they are and dont pick on others for being different my older daughter actually stands up for her friends if theyre picked on one happens to have a single mom and that little girl is picked on quite often -- it warms my heart when kassie stands up for her!so those of you who are condemning this show because you feel that its an advocate for gay rights or are being forced to accept certain views you clearly and completely missed the point of this poignant little cartoonand if you need it explained to you well you need more help than any television show could ever offer<SEP>1
this sad little film bears little similarity to the 1971 broadway revival that was such a nostalgic hit keep in mind that when burt shevelove directed that revival he rewrote the book extensively i have a feeling that this screenwriter wrought as much of a change from the original 1925 version as well i played the innocent philanderer jimmy smith on-stage in 1974 and thought this $1 dvd would bring back memories not a chance even the anticipated delight of seeing topper roland young play my part was a major disappointment three songs from the play remain and are done very poorly even the classic duet tea for two is done as a virtual solo the many familiar faces in this 1940 fiasco do not do themselves proud at all and the star anna neagle just embarrasses herself when i feel gypped by spending a dollar i know the film must be bad another commentator mentioned the doris day version which is actually called tea for two and is about doing the stage play the original of course so those who are seeking the true no no nanette might find a more recognizable version there<SEP>0
i have seen just about all of miyazakis films and they are all beautiful and captivating but this one rises above the rest this movie totally impressed me!i fell in love with pazu and sheeta and their sweet caring friendship they were what made the movie for me of course the animation is also superb and the music captures the feelings in the film perfectly but the characters are the shining point in this movie: they are so well developed and full of personalitynow let me clarify: im really talking about the japanese version of the movie with english subs while the english dub is good mostly it simply pales in comparison to the original language version the voices are better the dialogue everything so i suggest seeing and hearing the movie the way it originally was<SEP>1
now ive seen a lot of bad movies i like bad movies especially bad action movies ive seen and enjoyed all of jean-claude van dammes movies including the one where hes his own clone both of the ones where he plays twins and all three where hes a cyborg i actually own the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durians hey if nothing else hes got a great ass and you almost always get to see it with dvd you can even pause and zoom in! thats why you can trust me when i say that this movie is so bad it makes plan 9 look like citizen kaneeverything about snake eater is bad the plot is bad the script is bad the sets are bad the fights are bad the stunts are bad the fx are bad the acting is spectacularly earth-time-bendingly bad very probably showcasing the worst performance of every so-called actor in the cast including lorenzo lamas and thats really saying something and id be willing to bet everyone involved with this movie is lousy in bed to boot especially lorenzo lamas it does manage to be unintentionally funny so its not a total loss however i recommend that you watch this movie only if you are either a congenital idiot or very very stoned i was able to sit through it myself because i needed to watch something to distract me from rinsing cat urine out of my laundryit didnt help much but it was better than nothing one point for ron palillos cameo as a gay arsonist<SEP>0

shakespeare said that we are actors put into a great stage but when this stage is israel the work that we interpret multiplies for ten and all the actions we do are full of a hard style dan katzir manages to do a spectacular portrait of a part of life in tel aviv but besides katzir manages to penetrate into the heart of the israeli people and this people far from being simple prominent figures they speak to us from the heart katzirs film allows israel escape from dark informative crux in which they live and this wonderful country arises to the light as a splendid bird which is born of his ashes it is very great for me because the reality of state of israel which the europeans only know for the informative diaries or the newspapers appears as a close and absolutly human reality the reality of million people who looking for his place exploring the whole state the whole culture with the only aim to feel part of it katzir constructs an absolutely wonderful documentary and he demonstrates that when a man films with passion the deepest feelings are projected with force and these feelings cross our hearts thank you dan for open our eyes and give us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries of the world<SEP>1
certain elements of this film are dated of course an all white male crew for instance and like most pre-star wars science fiction it tends to take too long admiring itselfbut still no movie has ever capture the flavor of golden age science fiction as this one did even down to the use of the electronic tonalities to provide the musical score robbie the robot epitomized the asimov robots and was the inspiration for all that followed from c3po to datathe plot line of course is shakespeares the tempest morbius is prospero and exiled wizard who finds his kingdom invaded by interlopers it was a movie that treated science fiction as an adult genre perhaps the first<SEP>1
after finally watching walt disneys song of the south on myspace i decided to watch ralph bakshis response to that movie-coonskin-on afro video which i linked from google video in this one during the live-action sequences preacherman charles gordone takes his friend sampson barry white with him to pick up pappy scatman crothers and randy philip thomas years before he added michael for his middle name professionally as the latter two escape from prison during their attempt pappy tells randy a tale of brother rabbit voice of thomas brother bear white and preacher fox gordone and their adventures in harlem as expected in many of these bakshi efforts theres a mix of animation and live-action that provides a unique point-of-view from the writerdirector that is sure to offend some people another fascinating animated character is miss america whos a big-as in gigantic in every way-white blonde woman dressed in skin-tight red white and blue stars and stripes who has a hold on a little black man and has him shot in one of the most sexually violent ways that was shockingly funny to me! there are plenty of such scenes sprinkled throughout the picture of which another one concerning brother bears frontal anatomy also provided big laughs from me theres also a segment of a woman telling her baby of a cockroach she was friends with who left her that was touching with that part seeming to be a tribute to the comic strip artist george herriman i was also fascinated hearing grover washington jrs version of aint no sunshine heard as part of the score most compelling part of the picture was seeing the scatman himself depicted with his head in silhouette during the opening credit sequence singing and scatting to a song that has him using the n-word in a satirical way when i saw a vhs cover of this movie years ago it had depicted brother rabbit in insolent mode in front of what looked like the warner circles with the slogan this movie will offend everybody that is ample warning to anyone who thinks all cartoons are meant for children that said i definitely recommend coonskin to fans of bakshi and of every form of animation<SEP>1
this two-parter was excellent - the best since the series returned sure bits of the story were pinched from previous films but what tv shows dont do that these days what we got here was a cracking good sci-fi story a great big really scary monster imprisoned at the base of a deep pit some superb aliens in the ood - the best new aliens the revived series has come up with a set of basically sympathetic and believable human characters complete with a couple of unnamed expendable security people in true star trek fashion some large-scale philosophical themes love loyalty faith etc and some top-drawer special effectsi loved every minute of this<SEP>1

what a shame that alan clarke has to be associated with this tripe that doesnt rule it out however; get a group of lads and some stellas together and have a whale of a time running this one again and again and rolling around on the floor in tears of laughter great wasted night stuff al hunter homes in on a well publicised theme of the late 80s- that hooligans were well organised and not really interested in the football itself- often with respectable jobs estate agent but how clarke can convince us that any of the two-bit actors straying from other tv productions of low quality grange hill or soon to go on to poor quality drama eastenders can for a nanosecond make us believe that they are tough football thugs is laughable are we really to believe that the icf on whom of course the drama is based would ever go to another town to fight with just six blokesthe icf would crowd out tube stations and the like with hundreds andy nicholls scally needs to be read before even contemplating a story of this nature the acting is appalling and provides most of the laughs- oldman is so camp it is unbelievable most of them look as though they should be in a bubble of bath of mr matey a true inspiration to anyone with a digital video camera who thinks they can make a flick- go for it<SEP>0
do not waste your time or your money on this movie my roommate rented it because she thought it was the other movie called descent the flick about some travelers who get trapped in a cave so we decided to watch it anyways thinking it couldnt be that bad it was i cant believe this movie was actually produced and put out to the public it was so horrible it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away but you just cant make yourself i honestly feel emotionally scarred it went from being a semi-low budget movie in which a college girl gets assaulted by a boy shes dating to an all out porno flick and really not a good one i went from hating the womans rapist to almost feeling bad for him almost all in all an awful movie that was definitely rated nc-17 for a reason dont waste your money and dont let your kids watch it<SEP>0

one of b- and c-movie producer roger cormans greatest cult classics was the ramones vehicle originally designated for cheap trick rock n roll high school its just a simple technically dated story but would serve up extra doses of nostalgia humor considering these were the kind of things that made napoleon dynamite characters funny--see eaglebauers van about teenagers who love rock n rollstudents at vince lombardi high school are met with resistance by the evil principal miss evelyn togar played by cult classic favorite mary woronov who fears that rock n roll turns kids into uncontrollable amoral deviants and vows to make a rock n roll-free zone actually she intends to wipe out rock n roll for all students regardless of whether its at school and she has the cooperation of most of the adults who might make the plan successfulbut not if riff randell pj soles can help it a ramones fanatic she has written some songs including rock n roll high school that she wants to give to the ramones and in trying to do so is rebuffed by miss togar who does all she can to keep her from going to see the ramones play in town it culminates into an ultimate revolt between the obsolete fun-hating adults and the teenagers in an ending that is reminiscent of over the edge somewhat after the years of punk when the fame of garage rockers the ramones and others would mark another shift in music evolution it was great to see a movie that celebrated the fun of it all and in such a humorous exaggerated wayit is mostly mild comedy but a great feel-good comedy nonetheless when youre in the mood for something more laid back to entertain you with jerry zucker of airplane fame and joe dante of gremlins fame both taking part in some of the directing you can get the idea for what kind of humor youre in for and not to mention expect to see dick miller even if only for a few minutes in the films finale the story mustve later inspired and was consequently updated by the mid-90s comedy detroit rock city which some minor character changes in the vehicle for aged glam rockers kizzi would recommend passing on the corey feldman vehicle rock n roll high school forever released nearly a decade later the original is still the best<SEP>1
what could have been an engaging-and emotionally charged character study is totally undermined by the predictable factor fox is ok as nathaniel ayers the julliard trained musician who dreams of playing with the walt disney orchestra until his bouts with schizophrenia drive him into the street and ultimately skid row looking for a good story to boost his flagging career reporter steve lopez {robert rehab downey } gets to know him and tells his story taking every element of the classic how we hit the skids movies borrowing very liberally from a beautiful mind taking the bogus feel good attitude of films like rocky-you pick the sequel number-and whipping up too much 1930s style melodrama all that is left on the screen is a burnt out shell of a movie it is corny trite utterly predictable and plays way too often on our sentiments i hate to say it but this is the kind of movie that if you say you hated it people will give you bad looks i really wish i could say something positive about this film but i really cant the acting redeems it somewhat but not enough for me to give it more than one star strictly made for tv movie stuff not worth your time<SEP>0
i was expecting a very funny movie instead i got a movie with a few funny jokes and many that just didnt work i didnt like the idea of bringing in sherlock holmes and moriartys descendants it was confusing it would have been more funny if they just had someone new instead of moriarty resurrected some of the things were funny burt kwouk was very funny as always mccloud on the horse was funny the mcgarrett from hawaii 5-0 was not even mcgarrett-like connie booth obviously is very good with accents she is from indiana but played english and a new yorker pretty well unfortunately she was not presented much into the script i was expecting a more funny film instead i got a rather confusing movie with a poor script rather ironic since both booth and cleese were together on this one maybe they were about to break up in 77<SEP>0
i dont think ill ever understand the hate for renny harlin die hard 2 was cool and he gave the world cliffhanger one of the most awesome action movies ever thats right you little punks cliffhanger rules and we all know itsly plays gabe walker a former rescue climber who is just visiting his old town when he is asked to help a former friend hal tucker michael rooker assist in a rescue on a mountain peak walker obviously came back at a convenient time because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by eric qualen john lithgow qualen & co have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the us government somewhere in the rocky mountains and they really would like it backessentially cliffhanger is another die hard clone just trade in the confines of nakatomi plaza to the open mountain ranges of the rocky mountains complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal naturally that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough as stallones character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease and slams face-first into several rock faces with no apparent side-effects after all isnt that what action movies are all aboutcliffhanger is one of the most exciting action movies around a showcase of great scenes and stunts one of the early stunts is one of the best stunts ive ever seen in a movie and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning it maintains its action awesomeness john lithgows lead villain is entertaining and one bad dude quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains evercliffhanger is easily one of stallones best efforts definitely renny harlins best effort and a very exciting action movie - 910<SEP>1
well i have to admit this was one of my favorites as a kid when i used to watch it on a home projector as a super-8 reel now there isnt much to recommend it other than the inherent camp value of actors being terrified by replicas of human skulls the special effects are pretty silly mostly consisting of skulls on wires and superimposed ghost imagesbut theres something to be said for the sets the large mansion in which it takes place is pretty creepy especially since its mostly unfurnished probably due to budgetary reasonsit definitely inspires more laughs than screams however just try not to get the giggles when the wife who does more than her share of screaming goes into the greenhouse and is confronted with the ghost of her husbands ex<SEP>0
before watching this film i could already tell it was a complete copy of saw complete with the shack-like place they were in and the black guy wanting someone to break his hand to get out of the cuffs mjhs name on a movie would typically turn me away ugh can we say gross! but i still wanted to give it a trystarting out i was a bit interested the acting is absolutely horrible and i found myself laughing at almost each reaction from the characters especially the man that played sulley mjh was even worst but i continued to watchhowever the ending was the biggest joke of them all! i seriously sat in shock thinking that was the ending! is this a comedy!i thought this pile of crap was funnier than the scary movie spoofs and that is really saying something!<SEP>0
i waited ages before seeing this as all the reviews i read of this said it was horrible! i rented it expecting the worst and while it is hardly the best sandler film out there there are much worse! sandler frequently talks to the camera and the film does not take itself seriously but that is all part of the fun! a great way to waste an afternoon and you might even find yourself laughing once a twice! a good film well worth renting!<SEP>1
what a great gem this is its an unusual story that is fun to watch yes it has singing but it is very nicely crafted into the story and is very melodic to hear it was so pleasant to watch; i enjoyed it from start to finish! the movie takes place in england during world war ii it is about an apprentice witch who is searching for a missing portion of a spell that she needs she uses her rough magic to transport her and 3 children under her care to various destinations to find it they are joined by her correspondence teacher who is surprised to learn that the lessons from his school actually work! although the special effects may seem a little dated at first once you get used to them they become part of the charm of this movie in fact the movie won an oscar for these effects! the movie is innocent and fun - and its hard not to like the tuneful songs the characters are wonderfully interesting to watch i think anyone at any age could find something to like about this movie<SEP>1
the movie wasnt all that great the book is better but the movie wasnt all that bad either it was interesting to say the least the plot had enough suspense to keep me watching although i wouldnt say i was actually interested in the movie itself janine turner and antonio sabato jr are both gorgeous enough to keep you watching :they have a few cute scenes that should appeal to the romantics overall id give the movie a 7 or 8 it wasnt bad just a little lacking plot wise<SEP>1
i was lucky enough to catch this film finally on turner classic films tonight as it is one of the films that won an oscar for special effects in their yearly month of oscar winning films bedknobs and broomsticks is easily a sequel film for the earlier success of mary poppins that film too was a big success and an oscar winner best actress for julie andrews like mary poppins bedknobs has david tomlinson in it in a role wherein he learns about parenting it is a fine mixture of live action and animation it is set in a past period of british history if not the edwardian - georgian world of 1912 london it is englands coastline during the dunkirk summer of 1940 it even has old reginald owen in it here as a general in the home guard whereas formerly he was admiral boom in mary poppins ironically it was owens final rolethe home guard sequences not too many in the film reminds one of the british series dads army dealing with the problems of the local home guard in the early years of the war the period is also well suggested by the appearance of the three rawlins children as war orphans from the bombings in the blitz in london and in typical disney fashion in the musical number portobello road different members of the british army including soldiers from india and the caribbean complete with metal drums yet! appear with scottish and local female auxiliaries in costumeall of which surprisingly is a plus but the biggest plus is that for angela lansbury her performance as eglantine price is finally it: her sole real musical film lead in a noteworthy acting career lansbury never got the real career musical role she deserved as auntie mame in the musical mame that came out shortly after bedknobs did she had been in singing parts in gaslight with her brief up in a balloon boys and in the picture of dorian gray with little yellow bird and - best of all - in support and in conclusion of the harvey girls with the final reprise of on the atchison topeka and the santa fe but only here does she play the female lead so when you hear her singing with david tomlinson you may be able to understand what we lost when she did not play mame dennis burnsidethe rest of the cast is pretty good tomlinson here learning that he can rise to the occasion after a lifetime of relative failure the three children cindy ocallaghan roy snart and ian weighill actually showing more interesting sides in their characters than their edwardian predecessors in poppins weighill in particular as something of a budding opportunist thinking of blackmailing lansbury after finding out she is a witch the only surprising waste possibly due to cutting of scenes is roddy mcdowall as the local vicar who is only in two sequences of the film with his possible role as a disapproving foe of witchcraft he should have had a bigger part also of note is john ericson as the german officer who leads a raid at the conclusion of the film only to find that he is facing something more powerful than he ever imagined in the british countryside and sam jaffe as a competitor for the magic formula that lansbury and tomlinson are seeking as for the animation the two sequences under the sea in a lagoon and at the wildest soccer match ever drawn are well worth the view with tomlinson pulled into the latter as the referee and getting pretty badly banged up in various charges and scrimmages as i said it is a pretty fine sample of the disney studios best work<SEP>1
december holiday specials like the original frosty ought to be richly-produced with quality music and a wholesome yet lighthearted storyline they should have a touch of the mystical magic of the holidays basically they should look sound and feelwell special and they should have a decent and appropriate december holiday subtextso when i saw legend of frosty the snowman in the tv listings i got my kids 6 and 8 pumped up for it by telling them the story of the original frosty and passionately relating how much i enjoyed it as a kid as my wife and kids cozied up on the couch to watch the movie the expectations were high but 10 minutes into it my kids were yawning and my wife and i were giving each other the look and rolling our eyes after 35 minutes my kids were actually asking to go to bed -- i guess they were fed up with the insensitive language and pointless disconnected segments i was actually embarrassed about their and my disappointment with this movieunfortunately legend of frosty the snowman is more like a bad episode of fairly odd parents crossed with a worse-than-normal episode of sponge bob than a classic holiday movie dont get me wrongthose shows are fine and i like them as much as the next guy but when i watch fairly odd parents or sponge bob my low expectations for mediocre off-color zero subtext mind numbing episodes are always satisfiedwe picked out some good books and spent the rest of the evening reading together a much better choice than the embarrassingly bad legend of frosty the snowman<SEP>0
this film has to be the worst i have ever seen the title of the film deceives the audience into thinking there maybe hope the story line of the film is laughable at best with the acting so poor you just have to cringe the title zombie nation implies a hoard of zombies when in fact there are six in total this cannot be categorised as a horror film due to the introduction of cheesy 80s music when the zombies attack the zombies actually talk and act like human beings in the film with the only difference being the make up which looks like something out a la roux video if you ever get the chance to buy this film then do so then burn the copy<SEP>0
cut is a full-tilt spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do most of the standard slasher cliches are there; the old creepy house the woods the anonymous indestructible serial killer buckets of gore and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while theyre having sex thats hardly a spoilerthe set-up is simplicity itself: film-school nerds set out to complete an unfinished slasher masterpiece unfinished because of the murders of a couple of the cast this also neatly - okay messily - disposes of kylie minogue in the first reel they are joined by one of the survivors of the original film played by molly ringwald who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines the rest of the cast fit their roles well especially the lovely jessica napier who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around herthere are plenty of red herrings and fake suspenseful moments and there is very little time to try to work out who the killer is because the film moves at such a fast pace it also has an appropriate low budget look including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate good soundtrack too if there is a difficulty with this film it is deciding whether it is a send-up of or a homage to the slasher genre probably a bit of both<SEP>1
an old saying goes if you think you have problems visit a hospital that has been updated in recent years to if you think you have problems watch a tv talk showespecially jerry springers! this movie is one of those that is so bad its good! thats why i gave it a seven-its all right but not great its a great way to waste 95 minutes just as the daily talk show is advertised as an hour of your life youll never get back! all the familiar themes are hereunfaithful husbandsboyfriends the wildest audience on television women flashing jerry etc the shocker was watching molly hagan who normally plays sweet characters seinfeld and hermans head playing a trailer-trash mom and jaime pressly my name is earl as her equally trashy daughter performing sexual favors for virtually every man with whom they came in contact the men including the staff producer were presented as quintessential lunkheads who deserved what they got i dont want to spoil or reveal everything but the movie plays like the daily show here in phoenix its shown back-to-back for two hours every morning and after that everything else seems to pale again i give this movie a sevenits good but not great jerry springer is best taken in small one hour doses<SEP>1
this program is a lot of fun and the title song is so catchy i cant get it out of my head i find as i get older i am drawn to the wrinklies who get things done and these four are excellent in their endeavors some of what they do is outrageous but brilliant considering that now days with our pc world wed never be able to do it in real life i always learn something from the shows but if you like mystery drama comedy and a little forensic work youll love this show it reminds me of quincy me in one way and barney miller in another the way they work and inter-react with each other they screw up a lot but they get the job done and thats what counts<SEP>1
given that a lot of horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings the girls in this film would be collecting gold silver and bronze at a darwin awards olympic ceremony a mentally disabled baboon would have made better choices than they did and would have screamed a lot less while doing soif you like films with a grainy picture deliberately amateur camera-work my 92 year-old grandmother wields a camcorder with better results extremely poor sound and no discernible plotnarrative then this is your ideal film also note that you should enjoy the following: women screaming for no reason women whining for no reason in fact reason and logic dont appear much in this film for example: we have to find stephanie yeah i cant believe i was speaking to her like last night she called you last night yeah she wanted to talk about some date she got asked one what how come she didnt tell me as in our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and an array of grisly weapons but i have a problem with the fact that she didnt tell me she was going on a dateokay so the budget is low that doesnt mean you have to make it look like it cost half the budget the score is interesting since all - with the exception of one - tracks have been written and performed by the writersdirectors of the film itself in fact it would appear that the entire budget has been blown on sampling a track by the duskfall a death metal band from swedenthe most worrying thing of all in the entire film is the ending which leaves us with the possibility for a sequel<SEP>0

joan fontaine here is entirely convincing as an amoral beauty who is entirely incapable of feeling love for anyone but herself her husband richard ney has lost all his money through a combination of his foolhardiness and her extravagance and they are reduced to living in a tiny room with little or no prospects they continue to put on the most amazing clothes and go out and socialize as if nothing were wrong he is a charming feckless but wholly amiable fellow however fontaine decides he has to go as he has outlived his usefulness so she resolves to poison him when she realizes he does not want to divorce her so that she can move on she has meanwhile had a lover patric knowles whom she decides to drop because he is not rich either she meets the aging herbert marshall who has a yacht with all the trimmings and more money than even fontaine could figure out how to spend she targets him and decides he will do nicely he is all too eager to be eaten up by the young beauty he certainly isnt very exciting and has about as much sex appeal as yesterdays omelette but fontaine is one of those gals who has eyes only for money and the man standing between her and it is transparent so that she doesnt even notice or care what he looks like she looks through him and sees what she really wants and goes for it she proceeds to poison her husband and dispatches him very neatly and satisfactorily so that everything is going well but as always happens in the movies and sometimes even in life some unexpected things begin to go wrong and the tension rises appreciably so that fontaine begins to sweat fontaine is particularly good at looking wicked and terrified and as the net begins to close in on her her rising sense of desperation is palpable and has us on the edges of our seats hysteria and fear take over from cool calculation and cunning but she finds a fall guy for her crime in the person of her cast off lover who is an innocent victim of her scheme to set him up he is condemned to death for murder because the husbands death by poison came to light unexpectedly but sir cedric hardwicke playing a grimly determined scotland yard inspector thinks there may be something amiss and begins to doubt the story and suspect fontaine he closes in on her and some of the scenes as this happens are inspired portrayals of the wildest panic but will the innocent mans life be saved before he is executed will fontaine worm her way out of this one will herbert marshall protect her to safeguard his infatuation this film is expertly directed by sam wood and the film is a really superb suspense thriller which i suppose qualifies very well for the description of a superior film noir<SEP>1
for some reason this film has never turned up in its original language in my neck of the woods despite owning the tcm uk cable channel which broadcasts scores of mgm titles week in week out more disappointingly its still mia on dvd  even from warners recently-announced western classics collection box set which does include 3 other robert taylor genre efforts; maybe theyre saving it for an eventual signature collection devoted to this stalwart of mgm which may be coming next year in time for the 40th anniversary of his passing i say this because the film allows him a rare villainous role as a selfish westerner with a fanatical hatred of indians and who opts to exploit his expert marksmanship by making some easy money hunting buffaloes; an opening statement offers the alarming statistic that the population of this species was reduced from 60000000 to 3000 in the space of just 30 years! as an associate taylor picks on former professional of the trade stewart granger  who rallies alcoholic peg-legged lloyd nolan who continually taunts the irascible and vindictive taylor and teenage half-breed russ tamblyn to this end as expected the companys relationship is a shaky one  reminiscent of that at the centre of anthony manns the naked spur 1953 another bleak open-air mgm western the film in fact ably approximates the flavor and toughness of manns work in this field despite being writerdirector brooks first of just a handful of such outings but which cumulatively exhibited a remarkable diversity; here too the narrative throws in a female presence debra paget also a half-breed to be contended between the two rugged leads  and granger like the james stewart of the naked spur returns to his job only grudgingly his remorse at having to kill buffaloes for mere sport and profit is effectively realizedthe latter also suffers in seeing taylor take paget for himself  she bravely but coldly endures his approaches while secretly craving for granger  and lets out his frustration on the locals at a bar while drunk! taylor himself doesnt come out unscathed from the deal: like the protagonist of the treasure of the sierra madre 1948 he becomes diffident and jealous of his associates especially with respect to a rare  and therefore precious  hide of a white buffalo theyve caught; he even goes buffalo-crazy at one point as nolan had predicted becoming deluded into taking the rumble of thunder for the hooves of an approaching mass of the species! the hunting scenes themselves are impressive  buffaloes stampeding tumbling to the ground when hit the endless line-up of the days catch and the carcasses which subsequently infest the meadows the films atypical but memorable denouement then is justly famous: with winter in full swing a now-paranoid taylor out for grangers blood lies in wait outside a cave in which the latter and paget have taken refuge to shoot him; when granger emerges the next morning he discovers taylor in a hunched position  frozen to death! incidentally my father owns a copy of the hefty source novel of this by milton lott from the time of the films original release: actually he has collected a vast number of such editions  it is after all a practice still in vogue  where a book is re-issued to promote its cinematic adaptation likewise for the record taylor and granger  who work very well off each other here  had already been teamed as sibling whale hunters! in the seafaring adventure all the brothers were valiant 1953 which curiously enough is just as difficult to see in fact even more so considering that its not even been shown on italian tv for what seems like ages!!<SEP>1
anyone who has experienced the terrors of divorce will empathize with this indie films protagonist a scared little boy who believes a zombie is hiding in his closet is jake a mesmerizing anthony demarco simply transferring the trauma of two bickering parents to an understandable image or could the creature be real writerdirector shelli ryan neatly balances both possibilities and keeps the audience guessing her choice of using one setting - a suburban house - adds to the feeling of desperation and claustrophobiabrooke bloom and peter sean bridgers are highly convincing as the angry but loving parents however it is the creepy minor characters mrs benderbarbara gruen an unhinged babysitter and sam stone ben bode a sleazy real estate agent that linger in the mind jakes closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of hell<SEP>1
hold your man finds jean harlow working class girl from brooklyn falling for con man clark gable and getting in all kinds of trouble the film starts out as his film but by the time its over the emphasis definitely switches to her characterthe film opens with gable pulling a street con game with partner garry owen and the mark yelling for the cops as hes being chased gable ducks into harlows apartment and being hes such a charming fellow she shields himbefore long shes involved with him and unfortunately with his rackets gable harlow and owen try pulling a badger game on a drunken paul hurst but then gable wont go through with it of course when hurst realizes it was a con hes still sore and gets belligerent and gable has to punch him out but then he winds up dead outside harlows apartment and that platinum blond hair makes her easy to identify she goes up on an accomplice to manslaughterthe rest of the film is hers and her adjustment to prison life her interaction with the other female prisoners give her some very good scenes i think some of the material was later used for the mgm classic cagedharlow also gets to do the title song and its done as torch style ballad very popular back in those days she talksings it in the manner of sophie tucker and quite well gable is well cast as the con man who develops a conscience a part hed play often most notably in my favorite gable film honky tonkstill its harlow who gets to shine in this film i think its one of the best she did at mgm her fans should not miss it<SEP>1
the only reason to see this movie is for a brilliant performance by thom-adcox hernandez who is underused in the movie within the movie as usual tom villard is good too otherwise its c**p the possesor doesnt even exist how does he magically change the letters on the theatre marquee to spell out the possessor lame<SEP>0
dudley moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic this film is very witty film that relies hugely on the actors talent without dudley moore john gielgud liza minnelli and a few others this film could have been a disaster it is not always well shot and at times has some very corny music that tries to force a mood the psycho-like music at the wedding fight but the acting overcomes it the character arthur is hilarious with his drunken comments but he develops well into a more mature well rounded character as he learns to live by his own free will the end is fairly corny though i wont give it away but it could be improved worth seeing many times<SEP>1
sasquatch hunters actually wasnt as bad as i thought**spoilers**traveling into the woods park rangers charles landon kevin oconnor roger gordon matt latimore brian stratton david zelina spencer combs rick holland and his sister janet stacey branscombe escort dr helen gilbert amy shelton-white her boss dr ethan edwards gary sturm and assistant louise keaton juliana dever to find the site of some reputed bones found in the area when they make camp the team discovers a giant burial ground and more strange bones littering the area when members of the group start to disappear they start to wander through the woods to safety its discovered that a sasquatch is behind the killings and the team band together to survivethe good news: this wasnt as bad as i thought it would be the movie really starts to pick up some steam at around the half-way point when the creature attacks that is a masterful series of scenes as the whole group is subjected to attacks by the creature and the suspense throughout the entire play-out is extremely high the wooded area is most appropriately milked during these parts heightening the tension and wondering when a single person wandering around in the forest will get their comeuppance also spread quite liberally through the movie is the effective use of off-screen growls and roars that are truly unworldly they really do add much to make this part so creepy as well as the other times the growling shriek is heard its quite effective and works well its quite nice that the later part of the film picks up the pace as it goes out pretty well on a high note of action one scene especially i feel must point out as being a special scene on first viewing as a man is running through the forest from the creature he spots the expedition that has gone on looking for it raising his hands to holler to them for help the second he goes to announce his presence is he attacked from out of nowhere and killed quite hastily it caught me by surprise and actually gave me a little jump on first viewingthe bad news: there was only a couple things to complain about here and one is a usual complaint the creature here is mostly rendered by horrible cgi which made him look totally ridiculous and destroys any credibility it mightve had the air of menace conjured up by the opening of the film is almost shot out the window when the creature appears on screen its so distracting that its a shame a little more work wasnt put into it ive complained about this one a lot and is something that really should be done away with as it doesnt look that realistic and is quite fake another big one is the off-screen kills in here very often in the film is a person grabbed and then yanked away and then finding the bloody body afterward its quite aggravating when the kills look nice and juicy afterward otherwise i dont really have much of a problem with this one as everything else thats usually critiqued about this one didnt really bother me but it is called on for others beyond this stuffthe final verdict: i kinda liked this one but its still not the best sasquatch movie ever its not supposed to be taken seriously and if viewed that way its actually quoit enjoyable fans of these films should give this one a look and those that like the sci-fi creature features might find some nice things in here as wellrated r: graphic language violence and some graphic carcasses<SEP>1
if i had not read pat barkers union street before seeing this film i would have liked it unfortuntately this is not the case it is actually my kind of film it is well made and in no way do i want to say otherwise but as an adaptation it fails from every anglethe harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern england working-class area grabbed hold of my heartstrings and refused to let go for weeks after i had finished i was put through tears repulsion shock anger sympathy and misery when reading about the women of union street excellent a novel that at times i felt i could not read any more of but i novel i simply couldnt put down depressing yes but utterly grippingthe film oh dear hollywood took barkers truth and reality and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it a beautiful film an inspiring soundtrack excellent performances a tale of hope and romanceyes an adaptation of union streetnothe women of union street and their stories are condensed into fondas character their stories are touched on but many are discarded i accept that some of barkers tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing and that a film with around 7 leading protagonists just isnt practical but the content is not my main issue the essence and the real gut of the novel is lost - darkness and rain broken windows covered with cardboard and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine pretty houses and a twinkling williams scoreif you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of reality i advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like schindlers listbut without the happy ending<SEP>0

why is it that any film about cleopatra the last phaoroh brings out the worst in movie making whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest roman of them all julius ceasar and his successor mark anthony never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antics of over sexed high school seniors despite lavish sets and costumes this movie is as bad as any italian sandals and toga extravaganza of the 50s admittedly this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen which is why gladiator went over well but gladiator did not have all the romance novel sexmiss varela has as little acting talent as elizabeth taylor but timothy dalton has talent to spare pity some of it didnt wash off on the others<SEP>0
if you like horror movies with lots of blood and gore tons of jump-scare moments and unrelenting escalating scenes of excruciating death then look elsewhere if you like quiet moody thoughtful horror which casts blood aside in favor of a genuine feeling of dread then wendigo is for youthoughtful stressed out george his psychoanalyst wife kim and their young son miles are heading out to the snowy countryside for a long weekend vacation away from the city on the way up george hits a stag with his car the hunters who had been pursuing the deer are not thrilled when they find that george has ended their chase in particular deranged hunter otis takes it personally he follows the family to their vacation home making sure they see him he spies on george and kim as they have sex he fires through their windows with his rifle when they arent home letting them discover the ominous holes in their windows and walls when they return when kim takes miles to the drugstore in town miles is attracted to a small sculpture in a display case carved to resemble a man with the head of a stag a native american man tells miles that this is the wendigo a spirit of the woods who has a taste for flesh and is always hungry miles takes the figure home with him already haunted by the death of the deer the day before that afternoon when he and his father go sledding george is shot and miles pursued through the woods by a creature barely glimpsedor is he just in shock and imagining the whole thing hours later george is rushed to the hospital and miles still clutching his statue either faints dreams or goes on a vision quest in which the wendigo returns this time the angry flesh eating god - part tree part stag and part man - is hunting for otis who has finally gone over the edgewendigo is a beautifully made film almost totally silent but for the wind howling through the snow covered trees okay so the monster itself is kind of fakey-looking but its a small flaw more than made up for by the genuine feeling of tension and dread that creeps through every frame of the film and the eerie backdrop of the silent snowy countryside the performances are great particularly by jake weber as the moody and thoughtful george and patricia clarkson as his sweet but no-nonsense wife they are a happy couple with their share of common problems and it is the strength of their relationship and their love for each other that makes this film powerful watching this film is often like watching someones home videos so realistic are the performances this movie is not for everyone a lot of people may find themselves totally bored waiting for the hideous lovecraftian beast and bloody revenge that never come we can never really be sure if the wendigo even exists seen as it is through the eyes of a sensitive child and also later through the eyes of a madman this is more a psychological drama than a horror film but it has more than enough creepy elements in it to satisfy fans of subtle horror<SEP>1
this film was a critical and box-office fiasco back in 1957 it was based on a novel which was later turned into a play--which flopped on broadway the story is about some navy officers on leave in san francisco during wwii they have 4 days leave which they spend at the mark hopkins hotel the film meanders a lot and none of the characters seem very real cary grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama--but here he plays a sort of wheeler dealer and he doesnt really pull it off tony curtis or james garner would have been better choices audrey hepburn was initially set to play opposite grant but had other commitments--so suzy parker stepped in she had never acted before but was americas top photographic model at the time i think that she did a good job considering all the pressure that she was under grants pairing with jayne mansfield in a few brief scenes--did not really work the studio was trying to give her some class by acting with grant--but the character had no substance at all<SEP>0
let me start by saying how much i love the tv series despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man seemingly unable to pursue his dreams because of his overbearing manipulative father it was incredibly light-hearted and fun to watch in practice in my opinion it is without doubt one of the greatest british sitcoms of all time the tv series has my 10 out of 10 rating without reservationthis movie spin-off on the other hand is a true tragedy in every sense of the word hardly any of the essence of the tv show is transferred successfully onto film this movie has a very dreary depressing tone that almost moved me to tears on several occasions seeing harold being beaten up in a pub and not in a comical way is not my idea of comedy but is most definitely one reason why fans of the tv series will not like this movie the movie was painfully unfunny except for the scene where albert bathes in the sink and is seen by a neighbourthe romance between harold and zita is completely out of tone and it makes me wonder whether the producers of this movie ever bothered to watch the tv series in the tv series harold always went after respectable girls not strippersalberts reactions to the remarks made against him by harolds girlfriends were absolutely priceless in the tv series in the movie albert says virtually nothing when such an opportunity risesmost movie spin-offs of british sitcoms tend to be quite dull with the notable exception of the on the buses films which in some respects were actually better than the tv series itself! but steptoe and son has to rank right at the very bottom of the pile even below george and mildredmy advice - skip this one and see the second spin-off steptoe and son ride again instead it has a much lighter tone is more faithful to the tv series and is actually very funny<SEP>0
jack frost is really a cool movie i meanits funny its violent and very enjoyable most people say that it is b rated but that couldnt be farther from the truth it has great special effects and good acting the only weird thing is of course the killer snowman i think this movie was actually one of the best films of the late-nineties most films these days lack the criteria of a clive barker master piece that is be original and give the viewer what they do not expect jack frost is very cool 10 out of 10 grade: a+ ed also recommends the movie uncle sam to fans of jack frost<SEP>1
my brother is in love with this show lets get this straight i completely agree with the people who said it was copying off of dexters lab and fairly odd parents ive never really liked fairly odd parents i mean some things did make me laugh but most of the time its downright annoying and not cute at all this is almost the same way i feel about johnny test except nothing makes me laugh on that show the gags are so stupid and pointless and to tell you the truth maybe its just me but kids dont dress like that! yes i do think johnnys hair is awesome but cmon!and dexters lab that used to be one of my favorite shows and i still dont mind watching it which makes me disgusted and ashamed of johnny test making an absolute joke out of that wonderful show!one more thing the dog is so annoying he is more loud and obnoxious than johnny! and the gay accent what the fudge! i hate the dog to death and i hope he dies because that would be better for kids to see than listening and watching the obnoxious crap that goes on in that show and picking up a gay accentunless you want you eyeballs to burn into miraculous flames and your brain fried from this show dont watch it!<SEP>0
and this movie has crossed it i have never seen such a terrible movie in my life! i mean a kids head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled a snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible this was a pitiful excuse for a movie<SEP>0
lost 24 carnivale desperate housewifesthe list goes on and on these and a bunch of other high-quality shows proves that were in the middle of a golden age in television history lost is pure genius incredible layers of personal and psychologically viable stories underscored by sublime cinematography incredible to use this word when describing a tv-show a killer score great performances and editing anyone who isnt hooked on this are missing one of the most important creative expressions in television ever it may have its problems when watching only one episode a week but the dvd format is actually an incredible way to watch this hope they keep it up as im sure they do<SEP>1
movie about a small town with equal numbers of mormons and baptists new family moves in cue the overwritten dialog mediocre acting green jello salad with shredded carrots and every other inside mormon joke known to man anyone outside the mormon culture will have a hard time stomaching this movie anyone inside the mormon culture will be slightly amused with a chuckle here and there youll be much better off watching hesss other movies napoleon dynamite etc than trying to sit through this one the acting is mediocre jared hess has had his hands on much more quality films like saints and soldiers and napoleon dynamite i would recommend both movies over this groaner<SEP>0
let this serve as a warning to anyone wishing to draw attention to themselves in the media by linking their name to that of a well-loved and well-respected not to say revered author in order to draw attention to their home-movies out on dvdhyped to the skies by its obviously talentless makers in fact lied about only to be revealed finally as ludicrously inept in every department the fans of wells and of his book have been after the blood of its writer-producer-director since it appeared on dvdmany good points have been made by the other comments users on this page particularly the one about using this as a teaching aid for film school students since this film does not even use the basic grammar of scripting editing continuity direction throughout its entire 3 hours running time it is possible the director did show up for the shoot certainly there was no-one present who knew even remotely what they were doingan ongoing thread continues to evolve on this imdb page which should at least furnish the watchers of this witless drivel with a few laughs for their $900 outlaymuch was promised absolutely nothing was delivered except monty python meets war of the worlds with all the humour taken outindefensible trash just unbelievablethere are real independent film-makers out there to be checked out people who actually try to work to a high standard instead of flapping their gums about how great their movie is going to bepeople could do worse than keep an eye on brit film-maker jake wests evil aliens for example<SEP>0
unless you are petrified of russian people or boars this movie is a snorefest actually i fell asleep about 40 minutes in & had to fight the urge to just leave the theater i wish i had a waste of a perfectly lovely saturday eveningeven silent hill was scarier heck even pans labyrinth was scarier im still unclear on what was supposed to be scary in this flickto begin with im very leery of movies that use pidgin russian like this one did in the opening credits its embarrassing to me since i brought a group of my russian friends & we all cringed oh my godhmm well luckily for me & probably you too this movie has already escaped my brain & i just stepped out of it an hour ago so i have no specifics just murky visuals that go nowhere & some languishing-now-dead hope that anything would happenperhaps i saw a completely mutilated version of this film because i cant believe it got such great reviews here which is why i saw it & ended up being so completely devoid of not only horror or suspense but overall entertainment value as welli give it a 2 because yes i fell asleep & wanted to leave after 40 minutes but i woke up & didnt leave<SEP>0

i have not seen many low budget films i must admit but this is the worst movie ever probably the main character the old man talked like he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds a 5 year old could act better the story had the most awful plot and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was and hoped it was leading onto the real movie i cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight i think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman i think the only thing ok with the budget was the make up but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit awful simply awful<SEP>0
i love this show! mr blick gordon and waffle are cats so different from each other yet they refer to themselves collectively as brothers i often find myself trying to imitate the tired sighing accent of their butler hovis or even the scottish borough of gordon there should be more episodes made about human kimberly the episode about the cats disguising themselves as pre-teen girls to gain admittance to human kimberlys slumber party in order to get their thirsty paws on their favorite drink rootbeer is a hilarious classic we cant drink rootbeer in our house now without either doing the catscratch voices or the hanson brothers from the movie slap shot future classic where can i get the first two seasons on dvd<SEP>1

part ii or formerly known as guerilla is also a great achievement but not quite as entertaining as part i because this is where we begin to witness what might have caused the fall and death of che guevara once again im impressed by the cause-and-effect that both parts have in their interconnecting stories were reminded again and again that the lead character che guevara is an argentine some of the men in fidels army chose not to take orders from a foreigner and now that che has chosen to leave the comfort of victory to continue the revolutionary in bolivia he doesnt get much respect from his new army and the natives either only because hes a foreigneras far as technical goes i think part ii wouldve been more helpful if before everything else right after the display of the map it would show some highlights from the previous installment just to refresh memory about his characters and what hes set himself on doing to make the audience understand why his methods was successful in cuba but they dont work in bolivia it is clear now in this segment that che is not as charismatic as fidel castro in bolivia hes dealing with a bunch of soldiers whose hearts are not fully in it its said that the ingredient for revolutionary is love well they dont give a damn that much about their country so its a tough sell its excruciatingly painful and difficult for che to get the others to buy into his visioni like one particular scene that illustrates ches deteriorating condition a scene in which his horse would not go no matter how badly che tries to direct it and then his temper took the better of him and for a moment there he forgets hes a doctor and he becomes this desperate soldier whos stabs his own horse his army is like a horse that doesnt want to be led but at the same time the film drags it relies on small cameos from familiar faces that youll recognize just for the sake of brief entertainment and for the most part you get pounded left and right by one obstacle after another but maybe that is the intention of part ii if so then it definitely works standing ovation to the cinematography that gives us a first person view at the moment of ches last breath this movie may not answer the questions of why che guevara was so stubborn why he was so determined he could pull it off even wen the odds were against him and why he deeply wants south america to have the same fate as cuba but the movie che is a story worth telling<SEP>1
in addition to being an extremely fun movie may i add that the costumes and scenery were wonderful this kind fun loving woman had a great deal of money unfortunately she also had two greedy daughters who were anxious to get their hands on her money this woman was lonely since the death of her husband he had proposed to her in a theater that was going to be torn down to prevent that she bought it her daughters were afraid she was throwing away their money and decided to take action the character actors in this film were a great plus also i would give almost anything to have a copy of this film in my video library but as of yet its never been released sad<SEP>1
***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** juggernaut is a british made thriller released in the us by first national karloff is dr sartorius who has to leave his research because his funds have dried up karloff is forced to retreat to france and start up a medical practice he is propositioned by a conniving woman who wants to get rid of her much older husband she knows karloff needs the moneykarloff agrees to the proposition and soon becomes the personal doctor of the husband all the while the wife is prancing about town with the local no good playboy karloff finally injects the old geyser with poison and he kicks off however his son from another marriage arrives a few days before the killing and finds out the will has been changed when he spills the beans to the wife she goes berserk and even bites the sons handmeanwhile karloffs nurse has misplaced the hypo karloff used to kill the old man when karloff finds out he isnt getting any money he asks the wife to poison the son the nurse suspects karloff and finds the missing hypo analysis shows poison but not quite in time as karloff kidnaps the nurseto make a long story short the nurse escapes gets the police and manages to save the son who is about to be injected by karloff karloff instead injects himself and diesthis movie does have some good points karloff is possessed and plays the type of mad doctor he did in the devil commands and the man who lived again it is peculiar however to see him walk around stiffly and slightly hunched over we never find out why he is walking this way i suspect the director thought it made him more sinisterthe actress playing the 2-timing wife overacts something terrible she has a french accent even though she overacts badly you still manage to hate her or maybe you hate her because of her actinga little below average for a karloff vehicle if you buy the sinister cinema vhs copy the audio is a bit choppy<SEP>0
dead husbands is a somewhat silly comedy about a bunch of wives conspiring to bump off each others husbands` it`s by no means embarrassingly bad like some comedies i could mention but it never fufils its potential imagine how good this could have been if we had the farrelly brothers directing ben stiller in the role of carter elson oh is carter based on jerry springer just curious because the catch phrase on dr elson`s show is look after each other and keep talking<SEP>0
whoa nelly! ive heard a ton of mixed reviews for thisbut one of my go to hardcore horror reviewers really found it to be disappointing man was he right on the nose! this movie was acted by pure amateurs they had to have done one take maybe two on each scene the movie seemed soooo rushed the script was also poorthey had lines that tried to be unique but failed miserably get your meathooks off of me! oh man i hate it when movies try to do that it happens all the time with comediesbut with a horror movie and with below average actorsthe results are incredibly pathetic the lines and scenarios were all very predictable but what made me feel so negative towards this movie was again the damn acting it was awful besides by the little asian guy who worked the booth i thought he was greatthe movie is about 5 stupid dumbsh!t tourist who are on a vacation in asia they end up at the wrong place and fall into the hands of a mafia run sexslaughterhouse sounds like a cool story but watching someone with a bad case of diarrhea is probably more fun and intense to watch the only reason this is considered horror is because of the killing there wasnt a trace of suspensei like many other horror fans were dying to get their bloody little mitts on this but unfortunately with a huge capital u the movie was incredibly disappointing i did enjoy the ankle break and the blood effects the flabby chicks were also so soeverything about this movie screams amateur this is ryan nicholsons first feature length and for the most part he failed theres no denying he has a sick sense of humor and taste for horror i pray his next movie doesnt play out like another b horror flickunless he tells us thats what its gonna be even after this disappointment im willing to give ryan another shot from what ive seen of him hes a true dedicated man to the genre good luck next time because this was bad news<SEP>0
highly enjoyable very imaginative and filmic fairytale all rolled into one stardust tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive young and beautiful a kingdom whose king is about to die has said king unleash a competition on his several sons to see who can retrieve a ruby first to be king whilst a trio of witches want the star to carve up and use to keep them young these three plot threads weave intricately together throughout the entire picture blended with good acting dazzling special effects and some solid sentiment and humour as well stardust is a fun film and has some fun performances from the likes of claire danes as the stari could gaze at her for quite some time to michelle pfeifferi could gaze at her at full magical powers even longer playing the horrible witch to robert deniro playing a nancy-boy air pirate to perfection charlie cox as the lead tristan is affable and credible and we get some very good work from a group of guys playing the sons out to be king who are constantly and consistently trying to kill off each other mark strong jason flemyng and ruppert everett plays their roles well in both life and deathloved this whole thread as well peter otoole plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man ricky gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his brief five minutesnice feet but the real power in the film is the novel by neil gaiman and the script made from his creative and fertile mind stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works<SEP>1

this is a really old fashion charming movie the locations are great and the situation is one of those old time preston sturgess movies fi you want to watch a movie that doesnt demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it the acting is good and i really liked michael rispoli he was in rounders too and while you were sleeping the rest of the cast is fun its just what happens when two people about to get married meet the one that they really love on the weekend that they are planning their own weddings i know sounds kooky but it is and thats what makes it fun to watch it will make your girl friend either hug you or leave you but at least youll know<SEP>1
i just want to say that this production is very one sided breaks the impartiality needed if you want to be taken seriously there are no credits of the persons they interviewed so you cant have an idea if they are worthy of being heardtells the story from just one point of view to do this is very dangerous because the next generations learns the bad idea and thats why wars keep coming i know this is not the only reason about wars but doesnt help eitheryou can watch this documentary but read in the internet a lot before balcans are complex as human history is<SEP>0
i must admit that at the beginning i was sort of reticent about watching this movie i thought it was this stupid little romantic film about a french woman who meets in the train an american and decides to visit vienna with him i was not actually enchanted about this kind of script since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie still i watched it! and i was amazedbefore sunrise is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth we are sentenced to death or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity or that we humans can afford sometimes to live in fairy-tales the ending was wonderfully chosen we do not know if they will meet again in six months at six oclock in viennas station -in our optimism we sincerely hope so the actors acted in a very good manner so that i began to believe that i myself could live a love-story just like this<SEP>1
roeg has done some great movies but this a turkey it has a feel of a play written by an untalented high-school student for his class assignment the set decoration is appealing in a somewhat surrealistic way but the actual story is insufferable hokum<SEP>0
siskel & ebert were terrific on this show whether you agreed with them or not because of the genuine conflict their separate professional opinions generated roeper took this show down a notch or two because he wasnt really a film critic and because he substituted snide for opinionated now when ben lyons comes on i feel like im watching teen news -- you know that kids news show hosted by kids for kids manckiewitz is not much better its obvious theyve encountered only a steady diet of mainstream films their entire lives the idea that these two rank amateurs have anything of interest or consequence to say about motion pictures is ludicrous if they are reviewing a non-formula film they are completely lost show them something original and intelligent -- they just find it confusing wait -- i think i get it abc is owned by disney disney makes movies for kids while siskel ebert and roper promoted independent films and were only hit-or-miss with the big budget studio productions -- what a surprise: these two guys love the big studio schlock and only manage to tolerate a few indies plus everyone knows the age group tv advertisers are aiming for the blatant nepotism is the icing on the cake in what alternate universe do these guys qualify as film critics<SEP>0
the plot was very thin although the idea of naked sexy man eating sirens is a good onethe film just seemed to meander from one meaningless scene to another with far too few nuddiesplatterlesbian mouth licking shots in betweenthe characters were wooden and one dimensionalthe ending made no senseconsidering it had tom savini and shaun hutson in it you would have expected a decent plot and decent special effects some of the effects were quite good but there were just too few of thembrownie points go for occasional flashes of tits and bush naturally and of course the lesbian moments i also thought that the scene with the sirens bathing in the pool under the waterfall could be viewed as an innovative take on the shower scenethe film had many of the elements that go into making a first rate horror film but they were poorly executed or used too sparselyif i had been watching this alone and aged 15 i would have really enjoyed it for about 10 minutes with 1 hand of the remote control then lost interest suddenly and needed a pizza<SEP>0
this movie is one reason imdb should allow a vote of 010 the acting is awful even what some here have lauded the carpathia character! the script looks like it was written in haste in one scene the black preacher who was left behind when asked by buck what dan7 in the computer graphic meant said daniel 7 *chapter* 24 he probably meant verse 24 but the film makers missed this slip up perhaps the worst part is that the films eschatological position is biblically unsound while many christians have espoused the films interpretation of end-time events such interpretation in *my opinion* is faulty to understand these flaws read christians will go through the tribulation by jim mckeever and the blessed hope a biblical study of the second advent and the rapture by george e ladd<SEP>0
it breaks my heart that this movie is not appreciated as it should be its very underrated people forgot what movies are really about nowadays they only think about bum bum movies which can be quite fun watching with popcorn and friends like transformers movies which are oriented with hyper mega high budget like 300mln or even higher on special effects only and which are dumb movies without storyline its the kind of a movie what i despite most of course it is fun watching greatly made cgis but we do not gain anything essential from that kind of moviesi honestly think that performance was excellent especially busy philipps alongside with erika christensen and victor garberwhom i respect made this movie an oscar worth emotional performance by busy philipps was astonishing its such a shame we wont see oscar in her hands which she deserves<SEP>1
i watched this movie recently together with my sister who likes the performances of sophia loren im a person who they call a cultural barbarian i hate art in any kind of shape or form rambo is more my kind of movie action kills blood horror if you recognize yourself in this avoid this movie like the plague no one dies no action no nudity nothing of the kind let me give you a résumé in a few sentences it starts out with 5 minutes in black and white nazi propaganda every italian in a housing block attends a parade in honor of hitler except for a housewife an anti fascist and a caretaker the housewife who is cheated by her husband meets the anti fascist she falls in love with him wants to make love to him but the anti fascist is gay despite of this they make love with each other at the end of the day the housewife reads a book from her gay lover and the guy himself is deported by agents the end you want an even shorter résumé boring that short enough the guy should have used his gun in the beginning of this movie and shoot himself to save the audience from this atrocity on a side note my sister loved this movie like i said im a cultural barbarian<SEP>0
its boggles the mind how this movie was nominated for seven oscars and won one not because its abysmal or because given the collective credentials of the creative team behind it really ought to deserve them but because in every category it was nominated prizzis honor disappoints some would argue that old hollywood pioneer john huston had lost it by this point in his career but i dont buy it only the previous year he signed the superb under the volcano a dark character study set in mexico that ranks among the finest he ever did prizzis honor on the other hand a film loaded with star power good intentions and a decent script proves to be a major letdownthe overall tone and plot of a gangster falling in love with a female hit-man prefigures the quirky crimedies that caught hollywood by storm in the early 90s but the script is too convoluted for its own sake the motivations are off and on the whole the story seems unsure of what exactly its trying to be: a romantic comedy a crime drama a gangster saga etc jack nicholson doing a brooklyn accent that works perfectly for de niro but sounds unconvincing coming from jack and kathleen turner in the leading roles seem to be in paycheck mode just going through the motions almost sleepwalking their way through some parts anjelica huston on the other hand fares better but her performance is sabotaged by her characters motivations: she starts out the victim of her bigot fathers disdain she proves to be supportive to her ex-husband then becomes a vindictive bitch that wants his head on a platethe colours of the movie have a washed-up quality like it was made in the early 70s and hustons direction is as uninteresting as everything else theres promise behind the story and perhaps in the hands of a director hungry to be recognized it couldve been morphed to something better but whats left looks like a film nobody was really interested in making<SEP>0
born again is a sub-standard episode from season one it deals with the subject of reincarnation and just doesnt fly ive never been big on reincarnation and that could be part of my apathy toward this episode it does reference the tooms case which is some nice continuation from the previous episode but the positives end there which is unfortunate because that takes place at the beginning of the episode i think its ludicrous that a dead guy would chose to reincarnate in the body of a completely unrelated girl and he waits until the girl turns eight to start exacting revenge theres even a serious lack of witty mulder & scully dialogue to keep the episode afloat if youre into reincarnation maybe this episode is up your alley if youre not then at least you can learn what bradycardia is<SEP>0
i shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad that has been done in great detail already many times over the plot started out as a very uninspiring cockney wide-boygangster-by-numbers bore and very quickly descended into an utter shambles anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves it is now 7 or 8 years since i watched it during its 1 week run at the cinema before it was pulled yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film i have ever seeni am only making these comments and indeed the only reason i went to see the film is because of the amusing fact that my brother eddie appeared in it as the second heavy in the pub scene it was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards rhys ifans face in the bar in russia it was actually filmed at the former butlins holiday camp at barry island my brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever - he had recently joined an extras agency and this was his first part having seen the film it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoeveri remember there were about 8 people in the whole cinema - and this was just a couple of days after it had been released i have never heard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast - and rightly so in case you were thinking of renting this film on dvd i would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red-hot then jam them into your eye sockets this will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film<SEP>0
anna charlotte burke develops a strange fever that causes her to pass out and drift off into a world of her own creation a bleak world she drew with a sad little boy as the inhabitant of an old dumpy house in the middle of a lonely field lacking in detail much like any child drawing the house and its inhabitant marc who cant walk because anna didnt draw him any legs are inhabitants of this purgatorylimbo world anna begins visiting the boy and the house more frequently trying to figure whats what and in the process tries to help save the boy but her fever is making it harder for her to wake up each time and may not only kill her but trap her and marc there foreverwow! is a good word to sum up bernard roses brilliantly haunting and poetic paperhouse a film that is so simple that its damn near impossible to explain and impossible to forget while you may find this puppy in your horror section its anything but its more of a serious fantasy expertly directed and exceptionally well acted by its cast in particular charlotte burke and elliot speirs marc and yet its not a childrens movie either but meant to make us remember those carefree days of old that are now just dark memories rose creates a rich tapestry of moody ambiance that creates a thrilling backdrop for the brilliant story and great actors to play with paperhouse stays away from trying to explain its more dreamy qualities and leaves most things to the viewers imagination theres much symbolism and ambiguity here to sink your teeth into paperhouse enjoys playing games with the viewers mind engrossing you with its very own sense of reasoning as the story unfolded i was again and again impressed at just how powerful the film managed to be up to the finale which left me with a smile on my face and a tear in my eyebernard roses visuals are brilliant here hes able to create an unnervingly bleak atmosphere that appears simple on the surface but as a whole is much greater than the sum of its parts the acting is of young charlotte burke in this her feature debut is a truly impressing as well unfortunately shes not graced the screen since a much deserved burnout central award only seems proper for that performance toward the end the movie lags a bit here and there but i was easily able to overlook it i wished they had took a darker turn creating a far more powerful finale that would have proved to be all the more unnerving and truly riveting in retrospect the movie as is is still one for the books and deserves to be seen by any serious film lover its a poetic ride told through the innocent eyes of a child a powerful film in which much is left to be pondered and far more to be praised<SEP>1
this is a haunting powerful italian adaptation of james m cains novel the postman always rings twice directed by the great luchino visconti what is so interesting about the film is that in every way it transcends its source material to become something bolder and more original interestingly camus also credits cains novel as the key inspiration for his landmark novel the stranger the film has a greater power and intensity than the novel because visconti is able to create the filmic equivalent of cains narrative structure but offer a more complex exploration of gender cains very american novel is also uncritically fascinated with the construction of whiteness the lead character cora is obsessively afraid she will be identified as a mexican and embarrassed that she married a greek immigrant which is not relevant to the italian rural context that visconti is working in this allows the class antagonisms to take center stage and dance among the embers of the passionate doomed love affair of the two main characters this film is a complex suspenseful rewarding experience<SEP>1
i cant remember many details about the show but i remember how passionate i was about it and how i was determined not to miss any episodes unfortunately at the time we had no vcr so i havent ever seen the series again however i can remember strongly how i felt while watching it and how thrilled i was every time it came on sam waterstone was my favorite actor these days i think i was almost in love and he remains one of my favorite actors to the day mostly due to his appearance in the series i would gladly buystealdownload this series i think i would go to great lengths in order to see it again and revisit a childhood long gone any ideas does anybody knows of a site devoted to the series or has the episodes on tape from their first airing<SEP>1
nicole kidman is a wonderful actress and here shes great i really liked ben chaplin in the thin red line and he is very good here too this is not great cinema but i was most entertained given most films these days this is high praise indeed<SEP>1
some have compared this film to deliverance i believe of mice and men is more appropriate our leading man heaton definitely loves spike it is irrelevant and immaterial whether that is a sexual love it is the reason heaton does not leave spike he needs him they need each other as brothers as family as their only connection to humanity the setting scenario minimal cast all add up to a fine film frankly i did not care what happened to the characters but i did care about what the film maker did with them he did well with them i spent some time wondering how the ending would resemble of mice and men the soundtrack and cinematography were compelling and intriguing<SEP>1
simple-minded but good-natured drive-in movie about a simple-minded but good-natured high school graduate who has dreams of owning the coolest custom van in the world to use as his ballroom bobby our hero spends his entire savings to acquire the vehicle of his dreams joint sharing and love making quickly commence with girls bobby has picked up at the local pizza parlor but he finds out much responsibility danger and heartache come with being the owner of such a mechanical marvelthe van is a guilty pleasure of mine it captures the laid back mid 70s mood and has enough unintentional humor to put it into the so bad its good category<SEP>1
this is a good family show with a great cast of actors its a nice break from the reality show blitz of late there is nothing else quite like it on television right now either unless you count joan of arcadia as being similar because it has a teen lead character too anyway clubhouse is worth a look because jeremy sumpter gives the main character pete young a kind of likability and naiveté that is appealing without being overly sweet and cuddly dean cain christopher lloyd mare winningham and kirsten storms round out the rest of the main cast members and each is terrific in their role i really like kirsten storms as petes sister betsy; she is quite a pill but she still cares about her mom and brother even though she hates to show it it may take a few episodes to really find its legs but clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come along in a good long while so check it out people--youll be glad you did!<SEP>1
julie waters is outstanding and adrian pasdar a revelation in a very warm very real and extraordinarily entertaining look at the complications gender dysphoria and transvestism cause in a young executives life at the heart of this movie is the very real truth that you must accept yourself before you can hope for others to accept you<SEP>1
rather nasty piece of business featuring bela lugosi as a mad scientist with yes a renfield-like assistant and his mother a dwarf and yes the scientists wife sounds like a greenaway movie actually lol lugosi gives his wife injections from dead brides why them who knows so that his wife can keep looking beautiful he gets the brides after doing a pretty clever trick with some orchids that makes the brides collapse at the altar after another bride bites the dust a newspaper reporter just happens to be around for the scoop and decides to snoop around for a story she gets all sorts of clues about the orchids and lugosi heaven knows where the police were soon shes off to belas lair when she meets a sort of strange looking doctor who may or may not be eeeevil it all cumulates in a totally far-fetched plan to have a fake wedding to capture the mad scientist but it seems that the scientist has x-ray vision as he foils her plans oh no! what will happen i actually liked this movie as a bit of a guilty pleasure lugosi is great here his hangers-on are all very very strange the story is actually quite nasty in some places which makes it all most watchable a fun little view<SEP>1
i am fully aware there is no statistical data that readily supports the correlation between video games and real life violence the movie is false and phony because it is in complete contradiction of itself which is what i tried to emphasize in my original review the movie fails not necessarily because i really do think these kids were influenced by video games but because the movie sets it up as random and doesnt follow through let me clarify in aileen: life and death of a serial killer you can see her claims about the police and being controlled by radio waves are ridiculous yet she is so troubled she really believes them to be true the viewer can make the distinction however in zero day the 2 kids keep saying how they are not influenced by anything environmental which is obviously false since everything they do contradicts this neo-nazism talking about going on cnn with wolf blitzer which is laughable not only because they know his name but its a shameless attempt by the filmmaker to get coverage of his bad movieetc this movie doesnt depict reality it shows nothing but phoniness to prove a point unfortunately you fell for the bait and didnt see this and you didnt pick up on it from my review either the entire movie is just taking michael moores hypothesis and applying it to something real life in hopes of validating and it fails not necessarily because the hypothesis is wrong but because the movie is wrong and doesnt support it of course i dont think kids that play video games are more likely to kill people but if im not mistaken didnt video tape exist of the columbine kids or some teen killers shooting guns in the forest claiming how much they looked or acted like the weaponry in doom hmmmmmmm the distinction is kids are most likely aware of the media influenced but obviously balanced or intelligent enough that its not even an issue zero day is a bad movie not because i really believe a correlation exists but because the film maker doesnt know what hes trying to say and the movie does more to disprove his point then support it its almost as if the new ratings given to video games made someone upset so they came up with zero day in retaliation if you want to see the mindless teen killer theory pulled off right go watch bully<SEP>0
this film never received the attention it deserved although this is one of the finest pieces of ensemble acting and one of the most realistic stories i have seen on screen clearly filmed on a small budget in a real va hospital the center of the story is joel very well-played by eric stoltz joel has been paralyzed in a motorcycle accident and comes to the hospital to a ward with other men who have spinal injuries joel is in love with anna his married lover played by helen hunt who shows early signs of her later academy-award winning workalthough the joel-anna relationship is the basic focus there are many other well-developed characters in the ward wesley snipes does a tremendous job as the angry raymond even more impressive is william forsythe as the bitter and racist bloss i think forsythes two best scenes are when he becomes frustrated and angry at the square dancers and later when he feels empathy for a young korean man who has been shot in a liquor store hold up my favorite scene with snipes is the in the roundtable discussion of post-injury sexual optionsthe chemistry between stoltz and hunt is very strong and they have two very intimate but not gratuitous sex scenes the orgasm in the ward is both sexy and amusing there is also another memorable scene where joel and bloss and the korean boy take the specially-equipped van to the strip bar its truly a comedy of errors as they make their feeble attempts to get the van going to see the naked ladiesthe story is made even more poignant by the fact that the director neal jimenez is paralyzed in real life this is basically his story this film is real not glossy or flashy to have the amount of talent in a film of such a small budget is amazing i recommend this film to everyone i see because it is one of those films that even improves on a second look its a shame that such a great piece of work gets overlooked but through video perhaps it can get the attention it so richly deserves<SEP>1
earlier today i got into an argument on why so many people complain about modern films in which i encountered a curious statement: the character development in newer movies just isnt nearly as good or interesting as it used to be depending on the films in question this can be attributed to a number of things sometimes generic special effects and plot-driven hollywood garbage like war of the worlds but in the case of over-the-top uninteresting attempts at social commentary and a desperate struggle to put art back into cinema its movies like dog days that are to blamei normally have a very high tolerance for movies no matter how dull or pointless i find them ranging from good long ones like andrei rublev and dogville to ones ive considered painful to sit through a la alpha dog and wild wild west i shut this movie off 45 minutes in which is 30 minutes more than i actually should have i wasnt interested in any of the characters whatsoever and found nothing substantial beyond a thin veil of unfocused pessimism in an attempt to say something about the dregs of society this film too easily falls into being self-indulgent trite and exploitative in a very sincere sense granted ive seen many disturbing movies on the same subject but there are so many better films out there about depressing pathetic people happiness gummo kids salo storytelling irreversible that actually contain characters of great emotional depth and personality dog days had none more than an eighth graders distaste for society choosing to ignore any true intelligence about the way people actually are and instead choosing to be a dull awful and hopelessly unoriginal attempt at a work of art this isnt a characterization of the unknown or a clever observation into the dregs of society its just boring and nothing worth caring about<SEP>0
this movie i dont know why they would take such an indellible character as pippi longstocking and cast the singularly charmless tami erin i will never know why they would spend money on art direction and some not-all-that-bad special effects then not bother to edit it properly i will never know why the sets and costumes are sometimes in period and sometimes bizarrely not why they commissioned such bad songs why the script doesnt make any sense whatsoever not even on a silly childrens film level what were they thinking nothing about this movie is quite as it should be every single part is dubbed and always poorly every sound effect is slightly wrong every edit is in the wrong place every performance is bad in some way it does manage to create an appropriate atmosphere despite all the problems but it never captures the magic that is astrid lindgrens creation<SEP>0
the highlight of this movie for me was without doubt tom hanks as mike sullivan he was definitely cast against type and showed that he can handle an untraditional for him role hanks is usually the good guy in a movie - the one you like admire and root for sullivan was definitely not a good guy its true that in the context of this movie he came across as somewhat noble - his purpose being to avenge the murders of his wife and youngest son even so he was already a gangster and murderer before those killings so hanks took a role i wouldnt have expected him in and he pulled it off wellhanks good performance aside though i certainly couldnt call this an enjoyable movie after an opening that i would best describe as enigmatic it wasnt entirely clear to me for a while where this was going it turns into a very sombre movie about the complicated relationships sullivan has developed as a gangster - largely raised by rooney paul newman whos a sort of mob boss and trying to raise his own two sons and to keep them clean so to speak; isolated from his business after the older son witnesses a murder the gang tries to kill him to keep him quiet gets the wrong son and the mother and leaves sullivan and his older son mike jr on the run it becomes a weird sort of fatherson bonding moviealthough it ends on a somewhat hopeful note at least in the overall context of the story its really very dark throughout that mood being reinforced with many of the scenes being shot in darkness and torrential rainfall i have to confess that while i appreciated hanks performance the movie as a whole just didnt pull me in 410<SEP>0
i was absolutely mesmerised by this series from the moment tom long walked into shot - the whole bad boy thing it was just addictivethe story has you hooked what will happen next - will joey get the girl in the end after doing 5 years in prison and all that time thinking about his lost love crossing paths with her again finding he has a son although he is a violent bad guy you still want him to find happinessa truly captivating two parter - please bring it out on video!<SEP>1
i got to say that uma thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet this movie was uber cute and i mean uber cute it had all the sex content that most ivan reitman comedies have but with something a lil extra chemistry uma and luke both have this awkrawrd but believable chemistry that seem to transcend in each scene both seem to create this odd twisted and interesting relationship with powerful sexual tension that you laugh until you cant feel your face anymore anna farris and the rest of the supporting cast seem to play off each others roles perfectly and even wanda sykes rather small role will keep you laughing though these kind of comedies arent for everybody but i have to say i went with a person that doesnt usually enjoy these films and he was laughing like crazy this movie is certainly not for everyone especially younger children since some moments are little toowell lets say adult for younger viewers all in all i was pleasantly surprised by this movie tough the ending i found was a little weak compared to the rest of the film 3 12* out of 5*<SEP>1
writerdirectorco-star adam jones is headed for great things that is the thought i had after seeing his feature film cross eyed rarely does an independent film leave me feeling as good as his did cleverly written and masterfully directed cross eyed keeps you involved from beginning to end adam jones may not be a well known name yet but he will be if this movie had one or two named actors it would be a box office sensation i think it still has a chance to get seen by a main stream audience if just one film distributor takes the time to work this movie regardless of where it ends up if you get a chance to see it you wont be disappointed<SEP>1
this was quite possibly the worst film ive ever seen the plot didnt make a whole lot of sense and the acting was awful im a big fan of amber benson i think shes usually a wonderful actress i cant imagine why she decided to do this film her character piper is drunk for almost the whole film with the exception of the opening scene on the plus side there was several points in the film where the acting was so bad i actually laughed out loud but despite that i would not recommend this film to anyone its only 80 minutes long but thats 80 minutes of your life that you will have completely wasted<SEP>0
as the film begins a narrator warns us the screaming skull is so terrifying you might die of fright--and if such happens a free burial is guaranteed well i dont think any one has died of fright from seeing this film but a few may have died of boredom the screaming skull is the sort of movie that makes ed wood look goodvery loosely based on the famous francis marion crawford story skull is about a wealthy but nervous woman who marries a sinister man whose first wife died under mysterious circumstances once installed in his home she is tormented by a half-wit gardener a badly executed portrait peacocks and ultimately a skull that rolls around the room and causes her to scream a lot and to her credit actress peggy webber screams rather wellunfortunately her ability to do so is the high point of the film the plot is pretty transparent to say the least and while the cast is actually okay the script is dreadful and the movie so uninspired youll be ready to run screaming yourself true the thing only runs about sixty-eight minutes but it all feels a lot longer add to this a truly terrible print quality and there you arethere are films that are so bad they are fun to watch it is true that the screaming skull has a few howlers--but the film drags so much i couldnt work up more than an occasional giggle and by the time the whole thing is over your head will roll from ennui if it werent for peggy webbers way with a scream this would be the surefire cure for insomnia give it a missgft amazon reviewer<SEP>0
first of all f117 is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter aircraftsecondly the f14s and f18s cannot change their appearances; they are not transformers thirdly the f16 has only one m61 cannon not two last but not the least at the end of the film seagle selected sidewinder missile but somehow when he pulled the trigger the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick as i have the experience of seeing f18s and f14s being mysteriously transformed into f16s this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me however there is still one question i have to ask: how did they manage to use an air to ground missile to shoot down a flying f16when students hand in really bad work teachers assign 0s now i think for the sake of properly marking this film imdb should seriously consider adding a 010 option otherwise it is not fair for those who receive 1 out of 10<SEP>0
i thought that ice age was an excellent movie! as a woman of 30 with no children i still seem to really enjoy these humorous witty animated movies sid is the best character i have seen in some time better than bartok in anastasia although he was really humorous and i did not think that his character could be matched or even beaten and even more humorous than melman in madagascar i have seen the movie at least 15 times i own it obviously and i quote the movie at work on many occasionsyesstill my favourite scene is the part where sid says oh oh oh i love this game! and sid and manny continue to figure out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the tigerspack of wolves pack of bears pack of fleas pack of whiskers pack of noses pack a derm pack of lies pack of troubles pack a wallop pack of birds pack of flying fish or however that part goes! that is the funniest part about the whole movie although i also really enjoyed the humour behind putting sloths on the map and many other parts as well the only animated movie that can remotely compare to ice age is brother bear<SEP>1
i gather from reading the previous comments that this film went straight to cable well i paid to see it in a theatre and im glad i did because visually it was a striking film most of the settings seem like they were made in the early 60s except for the shrinks office which was dated in a different way and if you leave the neve campbell sequences out the whole film has a washed- out early 60s ambience and the use of restaurants in the film was fascinating for a first-time director whose background i believe is in writing he has a great eye within the first ten minutes i felt the plot lacked plausibility so i just willingly suspended my disbelief and went along for the ride in terms of acting and the depiction of father-son mother-son husband-wife parent-child relationships the film was spot-on william h macy a pleasure to watch seems to be filling the void left by the late tony perkins if this and magnolia are any indication tracey ullman as the neglected wife was quite moving to me it was a three-dimensional depiction of a character too often viewed by society as two-dimensional of course donald sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable portrayals the depiction of the parents bainsutherland reminded me in an indirect way of vincent gallos buffalo 66 although toned-down quite a bit! i would definitely pay money to see a second film from this director he has the self-discipline of a 50s b-crimefilm director something ptanderson will never have! yet he has a visual style and a way with actors that commands attention<SEP>1
hi im a friend of werewolf movies and when i saw the title of darkwolf hitting the shelves i was like hmm simple and nice name to it at least althou i wonder why i havent heard of it beforefirst of all the movie starts with tits lots of tits tits are pretty much all this movies budget went to who cares about a werewolf effect just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots!so about the mysterious darkwolf character a little spoilers ahead but who really cares hes your average everyday biker not even super-tough looking but like the old wise woman says in the movie he is far more powerful and dangerous than youve ever faced before just by describing her a tattooed biker-type of a guy pretty original i even had look twice when they first used the red glowing eyes special effect! i mean my god that lets-plant-red-dots-on-eyes-with-computer effect has been used since the seventies it looks plain ugly here! and dont get me started with the werewolf 3d-cgi as said before like an bad and old video gameand finally as i do like werewolf films like i said they prettymuch always build a werewolf-legend of their own darkwolf does build the werewolfworld as well about some silly legends of hybrid-werewolves and the ancient bloodline but it almost instantly after creating the rules of engagement the darkwolf kills anyone the girl has touched starts random-slashing which just doesnt make any sense why even bother telling us the rules of killing when they arent even gonna play by them aplus the wolf-point-of-view shots are made with a sony handycam or something filming mostly the floor and walls just add growling noises and youve got a super werewolf effect the gore is partially ok but when the wolf slashes everyone with an open hand just by basically laying the hand on top of the victims it just doesnt do the trick for metruly who gives money to make these heaps of junk straight-to-video horrortitles they arent even funny-kind of bad movies just sad<SEP>0
though ive yet to review the movie in about two years i remember exactly what made my opinion go as low as it did having loved the original little mermaid and having been obsessed with mermaids as a child could be i decided id take the time to sit down and watch the sequeldisney ive got a little message for you if you dont have the original director and actors handyyoure just looking to get your butt whoopedin the sequel our story begins with a slightly older ariel and her daughter melody my first big issue was that eric and the rest of the crew sang yes i understand that disney is big on sing-and-dance numbers but really thats what made eric my favorite prince he was calm collected and a genuine gentleman that knew how to have fun and he did not singand then theres the villain oh how could we forget the shivers that coursed down our spines whenever ursula slunk onto the screen terrifying both ariel and audiences around the world unfortunately that gene was not passed on to her seemingly useless sister morgana nothing was ever ever said about morgana in the first movie; she just pops out of nowhere trying to steal the baby oh how cute the younger sister is ticked off and instead of going after the trident decides to kidnap a month-old baby gag meother than being a flat character with no sense of originality in her morgana was just very unorthodox the same plan as her sister the same minions who by the way did not scare anyone i had a three year old on my lap when i watched this movie and she laughed hysterically she had no purpose being in there; id like to have seen mom be the villain im sure she would have done a better job than little miss tish over thereking triton held none of the respect hed earned from me in the first movie and dont even get me started on scuttle sebastian and flounder triton was a stern but loving father in the first movie and in the second its almost like hes lost his will to knock fear into the hearts of his subjects scuttle once a comic relief that made everyone laugh with his dingle-hopper yes ill admit it; i did call my fork a dingle-hopper from time to time after that in this film scuttles all but forgotten a supporting character even in the first he at least added something to the movie he was rich with a flavor the others didnt have and in the sequel they all but stripped it from him entirely sebastian was still the same but twice as worrisome as before disney dont do that dont even try to mess with our favorite crab or our favorite little fat fish who becomes a dad and has a multitude of very annoying children hes fat and hes bland and he looks like hes going to flat line any secondthe walrus and penguin were unneeded and after a while you just start to resent everyone especially melody who has no depth to her whatsoeverand one of these days disney im kicking out of my lifeif i didnt love your originals so much<SEP>0
drones ethnic drumming bad synthesizer piping children singing the most patronizing world music imaginable this is a tourist film and a lousy one what really kills it is the incoherent sequences india egypt south america africa etc etc no transitions no visual explanation of why were suddenly ten thousand miles away no ideas expressed in images just a bunch of footage of third-worlders with baskets on their heads as another reviewer said walking along endlessly as if that had some deep meaning if these guys wanted to make a 3rd world music video all they had to do was head a few hundred miles south of where the best parts of koya were shot and film in mexico that would have been a much better setting for life in transformationbut no what they decided on was a scrambled tourist itinerary covering half the globe and mind-deadeningly overcranked filter shots the only thing to recommend this film is that it doesnt suck quite as much as naqoyqatsirstj<SEP>0
the movie i thought was excellent it was suppose to be about romance with a little suspense in betweenrob stewart is a wonderful actor i dont know why people keep giving him a bad rap as for mel harris she is a great actress and for those who thinks she looks too old for rob its only by five yearsrob had a lead role in his own tv series as well as one on the scifi channel im sure you remember topical heat aka sweating bullets and painkiller janehe also starred in a number of tv movies and is now making a tv mini seriesthey need to give him more leading roles that is what he is best at<SEP>1
firstly i would like to point out that people who have criticised this film have made some glaring errors anything that has a rating below 610 is clearly utter nonsensecreep is an absolutely fantastic film with amazing film effects the actors are highly believable the narrative thought provoking and the horror and graphical content extremely disturbing there is much mystique in this film many questions arise as the audience are revealed to the strange and freakish creature that makes habitat in the dark rat ridden tunnels how was craig created and what happened to hima fantastic film with a large chill factor a film with so many unanswered questions and a film that needs to be appreciated along with others like 28 days later the bunker dog soldiers and deathwatchlook forward to more of these fantastic films!!<SEP>1
no one would argue that this 1945 war film was a masterpiece how could any 1945 war film be a masterpiece and yet this is an extremely effective telling of a true story that of al schmidt blinded on guadalcanal as played by john garfield who spent days wearing a blindfold to capture the nuances of a blind persons actions robert leckie in helmet for my pillowdenigrates schmidts popularity in favor of his foxhole mate who was killed writing that the country must have needed live heroes well i suppose the country did and they had one here there is a single combat scene in the movie bound to the studio lot lasting only ten minutes or so and occurring less than halfway through the film instead of being saved for the climax but it is the scariest and most realistic depiction of men under fire that i can remember having seen on screen including those in saving private ryan men yell with fear scream at each other and at the enemy and bleed and die without the aid of color stereophonic sound squibs or goresimply from a technological point of view the film is outstanding it isnt just that we learn how complicated a mechanism a 30 caliber water-cooled browning machine gun is or that it must be fired in bursts of only a few rounds or that it isnt waved around like a fire hose as in so many other war movies the technical precision adds to the scenes riveting quality the need to stick to short bursts is horrifying when dozens of shrieking enemies are pouring across a creek fifty feet away with the sole aim of exterminating you and your two isolated comrades confined to a small gun emplacement the performances are solid if not bravura including those of the ubiquitous 1940s support john ridgeley and a radiant youthful eleanor parker the framing love story is spare but it works and ultimately is quite moving a striking dream sequence is included its not bunuel but for a routine 1945 film it stands out as original and effective albert maltz may have overwritten the script or it may have been altered by someone else it could have used the kind of pruning that might have introduced some much needed ambiguity still there are odd verbal punctuations that have a surprising impact on the viewer -- why dont god strike me dead and in the eyes lee get em in the eyes! depths of anguish in a few corny words and a surprising amount of bitterness expressed by wounded veterans in a 1945 war film notes that might seem false to a contemporary viewer but perhaps shouldnt: the dated vernacular which its difficult to believe many of todays kids could think was actually ever spoken -- private gab dope drip gee you dumb coot dame a swell guy and feeling sorry for yourself let us consider the historical context and be kind in our judgments at the time some of this goofy lingo was at the cutting edge real weak points the wounded veterans get together and argue with each other about how much of a collective future they have and the argument is oversimply resolved with a conclusion along the lines of just because you have a silver plate in your head doesnt mean people will think youre a bad person there are sometimes voice overs and silent prayers that are both unnecessary and downright unimaginative please god let him return to me and that sort of thing well the film makers were operating within the constraints of their times maybe thats why the final fade is on a shot of independence hall and the inspiring strains of america the beautiful swell in the back none of this can undo the films virtues which are considerable particularly the impact of that horrifying combat scene its not on television that often if you have a chance by all means catch it<SEP>1
absolutely wonderful drama and ros is top notchi highly recommend this movie her performance in my opinion was academy award material! the only real sad fact here is that universal hasnt seen to it that this movie was ever available on any video format whether it be tape or dvd they are ignoring a very good movie but universal has little regard for its library on dvd which is sad if you get the chance to see this somewhere not sure why it is rarely even run on cable see it! i wont go into the story because i think most people would rather have an opinion on the film and too many reviewers spend hours writing about the story which is available anywherea 10!<SEP>1
heads hands and feet - a band from the past just like strange fruit a triple whammy there those who have professed not to like this film are either heartless or under 40 and have had no experience of the real thing sad for them this is an achingly well-observed little picture that is an excellent way of passing an hour or two and will probably not even fade much on the second showing stephen rae timothy spall as the fat drummer in many ways quite the most delightful figure of all and bill nighy - a new name for me - as the neurotic vocalist and front man all turn in super performances and juliet aubrey has lovely doe eyes to go with some sharp acting as karen who tries to hold the band together as they spectacularly self-destructthe syd barrettbrian wilson echoes are loud and clear mott the hoople rear up before one in all their inflated ridiculousness and the script is never mawkish for more than a minute dont compare this with spinal tap or the rutles or the full monty - its unfair on all of them the nearest comparison is the commitments and thats no bad thing and any film that can conjure up memories of blodwyn pig - a band i do not remember ever seeing but the name lives on - well it shows somebody in the team knew what they were on abouta small delight and thanks for the memoryoh and ive got another one - stiff little fingers; a-a-and what about steeleye span spooky tooth ten inch nails anyone you have to see the movie or have been on the road<SEP>1
the documentary presents an original theory about guns germs and steel the series graphically portray several episodes strongly supporting the theory and defend the theory against common criticismi was deeply puzzled to find user comments complaining about lack of new information in these series they say documentary presents information which is taught in middle school indeed it does in fact i greatly enjoyed the original look at the information which i have known since middle school and the unexpected analysisso if you like knowing why things work if you have taken apart the telephone trying to determine how it worked if you have gone to the farm to see how farm works and how cows are milked you will enjoy this series a definite recommendation<SEP>1
i didnt know the real events when i sat down to watch this just the fact that this was based upon a true story after the death of the kids father rhonda tries to help her daughter desiree i did not know anyone actually named their offspring that cope with the loss this is really made for children as is often the case with family flickswith that said go ahead and get everyone together for a viewing though id keep teenagers out of it unless youre sure theyre gonna buy the concept but it doesnt downplay the sting that the death of a parent is and it doesnt really talk down to anyone the plot is sufficiently interesting and moves along well enough acting varies with the excellent burstyn outshining most of her fellow cast mathis following that pretty well and ferland and her peerswith a few exceptions being the least convincing of the bunchand frankly theyre irritating; then again im not really in the intended audience for this thing the editing and cinematography are standard and certainly not less than that while humor is limited to a handful of amusing lines or so the tone is not an unpleasant one there is an intense scene or two in this i recommend this to fans of these types of movies 710<SEP>1
most people who have seen this movie thinks that it is the best movie ever made i disagree but this movie is very very good tony is a bad ass guy and knows that hes intimidating and uses it to get ahead its about him and how he goes from washing dishes to having a huge house and a office with cocaine all over the desk if you want a family movie then this isnt the way to go but if you want mobsters and vengeance and stuff like that then youll like it<SEP>1
i had the distinct displeasure of seeing this movie at the 2006 vancouver international film festival i have been attending this festival for over 5 years and i have certainly seen some poor movies on occasion however first bite has reached a brand new low in film in spite of being shot in beautiful locations with the occasional exquisite close up of fabulous food the movie contorts an excessive number of plot twists and stilted characters until i was practically begging for it to endthe lead actor david la haye completely failed to show any character development throughout the movie portraying a pompous chef from beginning to end additional sub-plots such as eating disorders were developed so poorly and completely did not fit within any context that the movie had shown up to that pointa theme of mysticism was used as a poor attempt to conceal a movie that achieves nothing goes nowhere and completely disappoints<SEP>0
a man brings his new wife to his home where his former wife died of an accident his new wife has just been released from an institution and is also very rich! all of the sudden she starts hearing noises and seeing skulls all over the place is she going crazy again or is the first wife coming back from the dead youve probably guessed the ending so i wont spell it out i saw this many times on saturday afternoon tv as a kid back then i liked it but i was young seeing it now i realize how bad it is its horribly acted badly written very dull even at an hour and has a huge cast of five people one being the director! still it does have some good things about it the music is kinda creepy and the setting itself with the huge empty house and pond nearby is nicely atmospheric there also are a few scary moments i jumped a little when she saw the first skull and a somewhat effective ending all in all its definitely not a good moviebut not a total disaster either it does have a small cult following i give it a 2also try to avoid the elite dvd drive-in edition of it its paired with attack of the giant leeches its in terrible shape with jumps and scratches all over it didnt even look this bad on tv!<SEP>0
i am a fan of the previous best of the best films but this one was awful no wonder i had such a hard time finding it i tried 4 video rental stores until i found one with a copy of this movie the acting was terrible the plot was a joke and the action was bad as welli really miss alex grady travis brigley and the original kickboxing characters and theme that this film had with the first 2 moviesjohn<SEP>0
jean seberg had not one iota of acting talent like all her films bonjour tristesse suffers not at all from her looks though she is perhaps the first of those modern women whom tom wolfe gleefully accurately describes as boys with breasts: publicists of course use the word gamine but suffers grievously from sebergs dull monotonous killing voice in all her films when had to play anger seberg played it with grossly audible distracting gasping panting between her monotonously droned verbalizations oypremingers adaptation of françoise sagans breathlessly juvenile fantasy soap opera plot is noteworthy only for his lush cinematography - but then thats difficult to funk on the photogenic french riviera and perhaps for his apt but certainly not groundbreaking employment of black & white for the present day scenes from which sebergs monotone narration delivers us to the flashed-back-to color pastjuliette gréco has a brief moment as a nightclub chanteuse in the black & white spotlight delivering in smoky dietrichesque voice the bleak existentialist lyric of the title song this moment is nowadays in retrospect more than a wee bit drôle except of course if youre french - particularly if youre a french 68-er longing for the glorious days of the barricades roundabout the sorbonne - and your kids riot to retain the lifelong sinecures which have blighted and emasculated frances economy: then you still believe in sartre and foucault and all such arcane irrelevant theoristsdavid niven has the hardest role having to play with sufficient gusto an aging hedonist whos yet to grasp that life isnt all about sagans teenybopper notions of a hip cool swingin mon copain! papa deborah kerr delivers her usual consummately professional presence convincingly playing the woman who suffers undeservedly sebergs spiteful teenaged snot-nose jealousy fulfilling sagans shallow teen fantasy of the classical theme of there can be only one queen bee in the hive; in fact to kerr belongs this films sole great and memorable on-screen momentthe dialogue is unnatural - i agree with an earlier reviewer who said that it sounds to be badly translated from french; combine the unnatural scripting with sebergs incomparably dull unendurable monotone and you can save that valium for another night atop all that the ineptly synched post-production voice dubbing is almost throughout obvious and thus much more than irksome: this is especially true of the dubbing for mylène demongeot because it spoils her otherwise very pleasing dumb blonde performancehunky geoffrey horne gets the short end of the stick here - a very good looking young man who also suffered from a less-than-lovely uncinematic voice which when paired with sebergs drone yields unconvincing scenes of puppy love horne was shall we say merely adequate in bridge on the river kwai perhaps because his end was held up by those great cinema pros william holden and jack hawkins instead of being unsupported by the regrettably ungifted sebergin sum bonjour tristesse is pretty to look at but its shallow immature soap: thin gruel with suds<SEP>0
this film came recommended as a good action film which i dont really think it is i found the story convoluted and not all that easy to follow there really isnt that much action until the end of the film and its pretty dark and hard to see whats really happening i was sure hoping for something different but alas didnt find it here<SEP>0
before he became defined as nick charles in the thin man series william powell played another urbane detective named philo vance the supporting cast is strong in this early talkie and powells star quality is evident mary astor who eight years later would be defined by her portrayal of brigid oshaughnessy does a good job here as the featured woman who finds herself in the middle of it all<SEP>1
the script for scary movie 2 just wasnt ready to go this is a problem with the film that is blatantly evident to the actors and the audience alike director keenan ivory wayans and many of the actors are funny people; and so the movie isnt completely humorless to their credit the film has several funny moments but as a whole scary movie 2 is not even close to being as clever and amusing as the originalthe first scary movie was a laugh a minute film it turned the smallest subtleties of the slasher film genre into comedic gold the humor in scary movie 2 is as heavy handed as it is un-original they even miss obvious opportunities for parody two of the movies stars are former cast members of beverly hills 90210 and this was a show that was begging to be parodied! in the final analysis scary movie 2 is like a fine bottle of wine that was opened far too soon the script needed a lot more time to age 2 stars out of 5<SEP>0
ive probably been spoilt by having firstly seen the 1973 version with michael jayston and sorcha cusack so the 1983 adaptation is such a disappointment i just didnt get any chemistry between the 2 main stars a lot of staring and theatrical acting just doesnt do it for me and what was all that about putting tim in the role of rochester had the casting director actually ever read the book very strange! hes a fine actor but mr rochester he definitely isnt! and zelah was just well strange bit of a mix matched couple in its favour the supporting cast were pretty good and the lowood scenes for me were the best of the adaptation but overall didnt capture any of the magic of the novel certainly wouldnt ask anyone to watch it as a true adaptation of the novel a real let down!<SEP>0

this is one of my favorite govinda movies of all time and best film of 1994 david dhawan does a great job in directing this movie he makes it funny and adds family drama govinda is excellent as raja babu and gives a great performance karishma kapoor is an actress i hate this film she is a little less annoying but still annoys in some scenes kader khan is a maestro in acting and yet gives a superb performance aroona irani is terrific as the mother and gives a outstanding performance shakti kapoor is brilliant as nandu the sidekick this film has comedy action family drama and romance a full on entertainer<SEP>1
i picked this one up on a whim from the library and was very pleasantly surprised lots of tight expressionistic camera work an equally tight script and two superb actors all meld together to make one very fine piece of film not for the reptilian multiplex brain but rather the true aficionado of cinema if hollywood ever does get its grimy hands on it im sure it will ruin it a choice treat all the way around other posters here have more than amply sung its praises so i neednt bother duplicating their paeans; just take their advice and mine and dont miss this gem call it what you like; i call it two hours of entertainment well-spent read my lips: dont miss it<SEP>1
beforehand notification: im sure someone is going to accuse me of playing the race card here but when i saw the preview for this movie i was thinking finally! i have yet to see one movie about popular african-influenced dance be it popular hip hop moves breaking or stepping where the main character was a black woman ive seen an excessive amount of movies where a non-black woman who knew nothing about hip hop comes fresh to the hood and does a mediocre job of it breakin breakin 2 save the last dance step up but the black women in the film are almost nonexistent that always bothered me considering so much of hip hop african-influenced dance and breaking was with blacks and latinos in massive amounts in these particular sets and it wasnt always men who performed it so i felt this movie has been a long time coming however the race does not make the film so i also wanted it to carry a believable plot; the dancing be entertaining; and interesting to watchpros: i really enjoyed this film bringing jamaican culture i cant recall ever seeing a popular mainstream film where all the main characters were jamaican; had believable accents; and werent stereotypical with the beanies the steppers family friends and even the thugs were all really intelligent realistic people who were trying to love live and survive in the neighborhood they lived in by doing something positive even when the audience was made aware that the main characters sister chose an alternate lifestyle it still didnt make the plot stereotypical i was satisfied with the way it was portrayed i loved the stepping; the romantic flirty relationship going on between two steppers; the trials that the main characters parents were going through; and how she dealt with coming back to her old neighborhood and dealing with crabs in a barrel i respected that she was so intelligent and active at the same time and so many other sistas in the film were handling themselves in the step world they were all just as excellent as the fellas i dont see that in too many movies nowadays at least not those that would be considered black filmscons: im not quite sure why the directors or whoever put the movie together did this but i question whether theyve been to real step shows whenever the steppers got ready to perform some hip hop song would play in place of the steppers handfeet beats at a real step show there is zero need for music other than to maybe entertain the crowds in between groups and then when hip hop songs were played sometimes the beat to the song was off to the beat of the steppers hands and feet it was awkward i was more impressed with the stepping in this movie versus stomp the yard another great stepping movie because the women got to represent as fierce as the guys in stomp the yard meagan good got all of a few seconds of some prissy twirl and hair flip and the deltas let out a chant and a few steps and were cut immediately even when there were very small scenes the ladies tore it up especially in the auto shop and it was without all that music to drown out their physical music i know soundtracks have to be sold but the movie folks couldve played the music in other parts of the filmim not a keyshia cole fan so every time i saw her all i kept thinking was is it written in the script for her to constantly put her hand on her hip when she talks she looked uncomfortable on screen to me i thought they shouldve used a host like free or rocsi instead deray davis was funny as usual though also i groaned when i found out that the movie was supposed to be in the ghetto like stepping couldnt possibly happen anywhere else hollywood as usual however only a couple of people were portrayed as excessively ignorant due to their neighborhood and losers which mainstream movies tend to doi wouldve given this movie five stars but the music playing killed it for me i definitely plan to buy it when it comes out and hopefully the bonus scenes will include the actual step shows without all the songs<SEP>1
knowing how old a film is ought to prepare the viewer for a few things and with those things in mind perhaps the moviell be more tolerable so it was when i watched revolt of the zombies the heavy reliance on tedious dialogue and corny movements should be expected as should the primitiveness or absence of special effects in those days a great deal is asked from the imagination of the onlooker - maybe too much in this case and the plot isnt easy to follow: some zombiefied southeast asian soldiers in wwi performed very admirably although skeptical as to why if true the explanation should stay out of the wrong hands so off goes a group to archaeologically investigate the key to long-distance hypnosis is learned by a member of the expedition who uses it to among other purposes temporarily dispense with the beau of the gal for whom he has the hots to prove his love for her he gives up his hold on everybody which he shouldnt have done cause once theyre all unzombiefied many want to kill him so that hell never control them again below average even with precautionary forethought recommended for only the extremely patient<SEP>0
the subject is certainly compelling: a group of people take their love of gaming one step further by creating a fake medieval world full of warriors kings princes and castles wargaming is an interesting phenomena that delves into our collective need to escape from reality and the sometimes mundaneness of our existence -- something almost everyone can relate to the characters are the predictable mix of lord of the rings nerds and star trek enthusiasts thats enough to get most people to watch however very quickly the film turns into an insiders view of wargaming with an almost stereotypical thumbing of the nose to viewers who dont get it the filmmakers seem to take the subject of wargaming and this particular one waaaaay too seriously rather than once in awhile recognizing the humor and fun in making a film about adults drssing up in medieval gear and pounding each other with foam swords its pretty hard for anyone who doesnt sit on their computer for 7-10 hours a day playing games or desiging the latest star destroyer to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should even care however the filmmakers themselves seem not to care choosing to focus solely on the subject of the game itself rather than building a strong narrative with a clear story that anyone can understand moreover the characters themselves are not that compelling and you quickly become bored of them: a big no-no when youre trying to keep peoples attention for 90 minutes<SEP>0
even though the shining is over a quarter of a century old i challenge anyone to not get freaked out by jack nicholsons descent into madness this is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off; instead it has been referenced time and again in pop culture the twins the elevator of blood redrum the crazy nonsense writing this should be seen if for nothing else to understand all the allusions to it in daily life the film is simultaneously scary suspenseful beautiful and psychologically intriguing it has the classic mystery of hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller and it has what horror movies usually lack: a great script<SEP>1
a major disappointment this was one of the best uk crime drama detective shows from the 90s which developed the fascinating title character played by scotlands robbie coltrane however this one-off has little to add and perhaps suffers from an inevitable let down due to raised expectations when a favored show returns after a long hiatus coltrane isnt really given much to do much more attention is spent on the uninteresting killer and in what he has to act in he seems uninvolved almost bored the ex-soldiers story is written by the books and the attempt to update us on coltranes family life seems lightweight perhaps if the writers had a whole series in front of them instead of just this one two-hour show they would have written this with much more depth as is skip this and watch the old cracker from the 90s which is far far superior<SEP>0
the sopranos 1999-2007number 1 - television show of all time everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that wouldnt go past a pilot episode the sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time james gandolfini plays the enigmatic new jersey crime boss tony soprano accompanied by a stellar cast edie falco is superb as the worrying loving upper-middle class mother; tony sirico is tremendous as a superstitious greying consiglieri who is often very funny while the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of italian-americans as mafiosi and to an extent this is undeniable i can see so many positives from the show the portrayal of strong family values friendships love and compassion; could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters yes furthermore other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism social inequality and injustice homosexuality drugs etc this is no shallow dull show about tough guys and violence it has so much more many of the issues we see on the show are very real the writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters lives which makes the whole thing more interestingcredit must go to david chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to james gandolfini for envisioning televisions most complex and enigmatic character simply exceptional1010<SEP>1
i can agree with other comments that there wasnt an enormous amount of history discussed in the movie but it wasnt a documentary! it was meant to entertain and i think it did a very good job at iti agree with the black family the scenes with them seemed out of place like all of a sudden it would be thrown in but i did catch on to the story and the connection between the families later on and found it pretty gooddespite it wasnt a re-enactment of the 60s it did bring into the light very big and important landmark periods of the decade i found it very entertaining and worth my while to watch<SEP>1
in the comic modesty is strong alexandra staden who plays modesty blaise looks more like an anorectic fashion model she does not either have the moral or personality that modesty have in the comics modesty would never give a woman an advice to show more skin to earn more money i cannot see any similarities with my comic books with modesty and this movie its like a mission impossible movie would be about ethan hunt locked in the detention room in high school talking with the janitor about when he went to junior high school and hunt would have been played by dj qualls in road trip soo if you are an modesty fan do not see the movie you will just get angry if do not know much about the modesty comics rent an other movie do not wast your time with this onei cannot understand how quentin tarantino can put his name on it i will ask for a refund at my dvd rent store tomorrow<SEP>0
yes its flawed - especially if youre into hollywood films that demand a lot of effects a purely entertaining or fantasy story or plot and you cant actually think for yourselfroegs films are for the intelligent film-goer and insignificance is a perfect examplethe characterizations are brilliant the story is excellent but like all nic roegs films - it has you thinking on every level about aspects of reality that would never have dawned on you before his films always make you think and personally i like that in a filmso dont expect to come away from watching this film and feeling all happy-happy because its likely youll be disappointedbut i think its excellent<SEP>1
not sure why this movie seems to have gotten such rave reviewswhile watching bang one night on tv i found myself bored by the nonsensical random plot which was occurring on screen the entire movie seems to be nothing more than an exercise in meaningless artsy-fartsy self-indulgence on the part of the filmmaker the fact that the directorwriter goes by a one name moniker only reinforces this sense of pretentiousness those interested in indie flicks would be better off looking for something better written and dare i say more entertaining than this complete waste of time<SEP>0
this is absolutely one of the best movies ive ever seen it takes me on a a roller-coaster of emotions i laugh and cry and get disgusted and happy and in love! all this in a little over two hours of time! the actors are all brilliant! i have to mention the leading actor of course michael nyquist he does a remarkable job!! i also admire the actor who plays tore who plays this mentally-challenged young man in such a convincing way! he sort of reminded me of leonardo di caprios roll in gilbert grape! and then there is the most beautiful song in the world: gabriellas sångi recommend this for everyone to see and enjoy!<SEP>1
a solid b moviei like jake weber his understated delivery is refreshing in a time of over the top performances i liked the relationship between the father and son i liked the family dynamics the wendigo looks silly but it is a representation of the kids toy and the dead deer its an amalgamation like see this is a psychological story not a freddy slash em up instant gratification flick watch it and reflect on your inner child and what the movie might have to say to you and youll be finenice work<SEP>1
what could be more schlocky than the idea of private detectives getting involved with the women theyre supposed to be spying on and most of the dialogue as written is perfectly banalbut the actors turn the dialog into something that makes sense you can see real people behind the unreal lines and the directing is wonderful each scene does just what it has to and ends without dragging on too longi showed this to several friends in the mid-80s because i was perplexed at how such bad material could be made into such a good movie the friends enjoyed it too<SEP>1
a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie its based on a novel of the same title which was equally good though different from the film really made you think about how youd respond if you were in the shoes of the characters recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent spouse or family member--in other words everyone!though the production isnt quite hollywood quality--no big special effects--still the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it and the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes illyou dont want to miss this!<SEP>1
a lonely depressed french boy mathieu jeremie elkaim on vacation in the summer meets and falls in love with cedric the gorgeous stephane rideau quiet and slow this is a very frustrating movie on one hand i was absorbed by it and really felt for the two boys on the other i was getting annoyed--the film constantly keeps flashing around from the past to the present with no rhyme or reason its very confusing and pointless spoilers ahead!!!also there are tons of plot holes--mathieu at one point does something that ends him up in the hospital what is it--were never told! then he breaks up with cedric and tells everybody else hes living with him why were not told then he hooks up inexplicably with another guy at the end why no explanation its clear cedric loves mathieu and mathieu is living in the same town so however it is a tribute to the film that you really care about the characters so much if only things were explained!elkaim as mathieu is not good hes tall handsome and has a nice body--but he cant act his idea of acting is sitting around with a blank look on his face--all the time rideau on the other hand is great hes very handsome has a very nice body and is one hell of an actor also he has an incredible sexual magnetism about him there is full frontal male nudity lots of kissing and a fairly explicit sex scene in the movie which is great--most movies shy away from showing male-male love scenes this one doesnt and it helps to see how the characters care and feel for each otherso a frustrating film but somewhat worth seeing--especially for rideaus nude scenes--that is if you like good-looking nude young men!<SEP>1
wow this was a movie was completely captivating i could not believe that i started awake so late to watch it but it came on late ounce i started watching i couldnt stop it had a full range of very good cast members wow even eartha kitt and ruby dee forrest whittaker and james earl jones and many more well known actors and actresses this was more than a glimpse into history it was eye opening into another part of society that people dont know of and may even be embarrassed to talk about ive never heard of a book or movie about this before and this is something that black history never addresses only looks down on because they were privleged and mixed race i highly recommend this movie<SEP>1
this is a very memorable spaghetti western it has a great storyline interesting characters and some very good acting especially from rosalba neri her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic she steals every scene she is in and expresses so much with her face and eyes even when shes not speaking her performance is very believable she manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top not that theres anything wrong with being over the top mark damon is surprisingly good in this movie toothe music score is excellent and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie whether you want it to or not there are a couple of parts that are very amusing i especially like the part where rosalba neri undresses in front of the parrot theres also lots of slick gun-play thats very well donei would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasnt for two things the first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film this is one of the most ridiculous looking fights i have ever seen in a movie it is very poorly choreographed and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight one might be able to overlook this if it were a terence hillbud spencer comedy but this is a more serious western and the brawl really needed to be more realistic the other thing that annoyed me about this movie was yumas cowardly mexican sidekick i guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this and he wasnt at all funny all i can say is where is tuco when you need him all that having been said let me assure everyone reading this that johnny yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults i have mentioned and all fans of the genre need to see this movie<SEP>1

i got this dvd from a friend who got it from someone else and that probably keeps going on even the cover of the dvd looks cheap as is the entire movie gunshots and fist fights with delayed sound effects some of the worst actors i´ve seen in my life a very simple plot it made me laugh ´till my stomach hurt! with very few financial resources i must admit it looked pretty professional seen as a movie it was one of the 13 in a dozen wannabe gangsta flicks nobody´s waiting for so: if you´re tired and want a cheap laugh see this movie if not throw it out of the window<SEP>0

robin williams does his best to combine comedy and pathos but comes off a bit shrill donald moffat is too one-note as his father-in-law jeff bridges is excellent though as the quarterback and holly palance and pamela reed are marvelous carrying the film through most of its rough spots it fills time nicely but is little more than that<SEP>1
previous commentator steve richmond stated that a walk on the moon is in his words not worth your $7 i ended up paying a bit more than that to import what is one of the worst-quality dvds i have yet seen of this film or any film in existence even when you ignore the fact that the dvd is clearly sourced from an interlaced master and just plain nasty to watch in motion the film has no redeeming qualities save annas presence to make watching a top quality blu-ray transfer worthwhile not that this is any fault of the other actors liev schreiber diane lane tovah feldshuh and viggo mortensen all score high on the relative to anna paquin acting ability chart far more so than holly hunter or sam neill did in spite of an equally lousy script anyway director tony goldwyns resume is nothing to crow about but pamela grays resume includes wes cravens most dramatic excursions outside of the horror or slasher genre so one could be forgiven for thinking this is a case of bad directionas i have indicated already the sole reason i watched this film is anna paquin in her acting debut she literally acted veterans of the industry with a minimum of twelve years experience above hers under the table while she is not as far ahead of her castmates here her performance as a girl that starts the piece as a brat and grows into a woman whose world is crashing down around her proves her oscar was no fluke for some time i have been stating to friends that she would be the best choice to portray the heroine of my second complete novel and a dialogue seventy-three minutes into this film is yet another demonstration of why this woman could literally act the paint off walls anna aside only liev schreiber comes close to eliciting any sympathy from an audience sure his character spends the vast majority of the film neglecting a wife with an existential crisis but he plays the angered reaction of a man who feels cheated brilliantly i should know even if it is not from the same circumstances hereviggo mortensen also deserves credit for his portrayal of a travelling salesman although perhaps not to the same extent in a manner of speaking he is the villain of the piece but he successfully gives the character a third dimension yes his actions even after the whole thing explodes are underhanded but not many men would act any differently in his situation nobody wants to be the other man in this kind of messed-up situation so viggo deserves a lot of credit for giving it a try here unfortunately these are all participants in a story about a woman who feels trapped in a stagnant marriage where tovah feldshuh tells us that the mills and boon archetype of women being the only ones who feel life is passing by simply does not exist either writer pamela gray or director tony goldwyn thought they could just put this line into the film without thinking of how the audience might receive it anna even gets to speak the mind of the audience when she asks diane who she is to be lecturing anyone about responsibilitythat said the film does have a couple of things besides anna going for it mason darings original music while not standing out in any way gives the film a certain feeling of being keyed into the time depicted that helps where the other elements do not roger ebert is right when he points out that while liev is a great actor putting him alongside viggo in the story of a woman forced to choose between her marriage and her fantasy is a big mistake he is also very correct in that when the film lingers over scenes of lane and mortensen skinny-dipping or mounting one another under a waterfall it loses focus from being a story of a transgression and becomes soft porn the film seems terminally confused about the position of its story no matter how many times i rewatch lievs scenes i cannot help but feel he has been shortchanged in the direction or editing one does not have to make their leads particularly handsome or beautiful but taking steps to make them the most interesting or developed characters in the piece would have gone a long wayebert also hits the nail right on the head when he says that every time he saw anna on the screen he thought her character was where the real story lay stories about the wife feeling neglected and running into the arms of a man who seems interesting or even dangerous are a dime a dozen to such an extent now that even setting the story in parallel with an event as earth-shattering as the moon landing will not help in spite of feeling revulsion at the manner in which her characters story is presented anna might as well be walking around with a neon sign above her head asking the audience if they would not prefer to see the whole thing through her eyes while i am all too aware that it is difficult to control exactly which character your audience will find the most interesting from your cast it is very much as if they did not bother to try with lane and schreiber fans of these two would be well advised to look elsewhere hopefully by now my ramblings about the respective performances will give some idea of where the whole thing went wrongi gave a walk on the moon a three out of ten anna paquin earns it a bonus point with one of her best performances and that is saying something<SEP>0
watching josh kornbluth act in this movie reminds me of my freshman tv production class where the not funny had the chance to prove just how unfunny they really were!obvious is the word that comes to mind when i try to synopsize this wannabe comedy the jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed the delivery is painfully bad ouch!!!!!!! the writing is simply dorkish it is akin to a bob saget show watching this movie is as painful as watching a one and a half hour long saturday night live skit post belushi i hated this movie and want my money back!!!<SEP>0
i always thought people were a little too cynical about these old andy hardy films a couple of them werent bad modern film critics are not ones who usually prefer nice to nasty so goody-two shoes movies like these rarely get praisenonetheless i cant defend this movie either you can still have an dated dialog but still laugh and cry over the story watching this you just shake your head ask yourself how stupid can you get this is cornier than corny if you know what i mean it is so corny i cannot fathom too many people actually sitting through the entire hour-and-a-halfthe story basically is andy mickey rooney trying to get out of jam because he makes up some story about involved with some débutante from new york city as if that was the ultimate people were a lot more social-conscious in the old days youd hear the term social-climber as if knowing rich or beautiful people was the highest achievement you could make it life its all utter nonsense of course and looks even more so todayhowever its about as innocent and clean a story and series there were a half dozen of these andy hardy films made as you could find also if you like to hear judy garland sing then this is your ticket as she sings a couple of songs in here and she croons her way into andys heart oh man i almost throw up even writing about this!<SEP>0
this could be a strong candidate for the worst flick ever perhaps without the presence of john hurt it could be tolerated as a kid-film however the tragedy of this entire endeavor is that john hurt one of the screens greatest actors diminishes himself in thisi gave it two points just because mr hurt showed upi take away 8 points because he didnt run from it fast enough as far as the rest of the cast they are simply terrible janine turner as pretty as she might be cannot act to save her soul and the lead actor is for all intents and purposes awful if you can spare yourself this embarrassment please do so its so bad it almost hurts<SEP>0
1408 is the latest hodge podge of cheap scare tactics the kind that might make date-movie styled horror fans occasionally jump in their seat and scream in your ear but disappoint audiences searching for a little depth and directionjohn cusak plays a writer whos made a career of writing books describing his experiences of staying in rumored haunted hotels despite assurances by patrons and owners that ghosts roam the halls there is little to make him a real believer in the paranormal when he learns of the history of room 1408 at the overlook hotel--no wait i mean dolphin hotel in new york city--he decides it would make the perfect closing chapter to his latest book but samuel l jackson playing the hotel owner strongly attempts to dissuade his guest with narration of the atrocities that have occurred in theat room since the hotels opening many years ago the story is simple and we as possible skeptics must sit through jacksons lengthy foreshadowing ramble in other words: be afraid! be very afraid!of course it would be easy to convince audiences that theyve just paid to see an edge-of-the-seat thriller if it didnt take so long to build up to this point and also if what followed was a lot more than cheap boos that become so frequent and arbitrary that eventually you might soon expect them the temperature in the room changes automatically the walls drip with blood the fearless writer cant open the door etc and after nearly an hour and a half of delivering these to audiences promised big thrills you might sit and hope that at least you can be wowed by the ending with suspicions of dream sequences and other derivative time-wasters even that fails to quell our doubts that before the movie is over we might finally have something to make the movie a little less than completely forgettabledespite grand performances as always by cusak who essentially is the entire film most everyone else of note is wasted ie samuel l jackson in insignificant minor roles the true mystery here is how this movie received such a high viewer rating ballot-stuffing ghosts<SEP>0
this movie has so many wonderful elements to it! the debut performance of reese witherspoon is of course marvelous but so too is her chemistry with jason london the score is remarkable breezy and pure james newton howard enhances the quality of any film he composes for tenfold he also seems to have a knack for lost-days-of-youth movies be sure to catch his score for the recent peter pan and the haunting gothic music of the village i first saw this film at about 13 or 14 and now i dont just cry at the ending i shed a tear or two for the nostalgia show this movie to your daughters it will end up becoming a lifetime comfort film<SEP>1
as if most people didnt already have a jittery outlook on the field of dentistry this little movie will sure make you paranoid patients squirm a successful dental hygienist witnesses his wife going down on the pool man on their anniversary of all days! and snaps big time into a furious breakdown after shooting an attack dogs head off he strolls into work and ends up taking his marital aggression out on the patients as he plans what to do about his slut of a wife there are plenty of up-close shots of mouth-jabbing tongue-cutting and beauty queen fondling as well as a marvelously deranged performance by corbin bernsen the scene in which he ties up and gases his wife before mercilessly yanking her teeth out is definitely hard to watch a dentist is absolutely the wrong kind of person to go off the deep end and this movie sure explains that in detail the dentist is incredibly entertaining fast-paced and laughably gory at times check it out!<SEP>1
in the film kongwon-do ui him it features a relatively intimate look into the meaningfulness as well as general meaninglessness into the lives of various koreans; empty people seeking ways to fill themselves enjoying the escapism of nature from the beginning to the end of the film we observe the fallibility of the various characters; we learn of their shortcomings and their desires the overall complexity captured within human life and yet the overal simplicity of humanity although the film is slow-moving it can be very contemplative it does not force any ideas but allows the ideas to come about themselves it allows the concepts to reveal themselvesthe film ends as well and as suddenly as it begins and one truly understands the meaning of aloneness that love is often an act of selfishness and the many mistakes that we make it is a look into everyday life very well and beautifully doneif you are looking for action or for intense drama this is not the film for you however if you enjoy honest original and meaningful films that are not forced and without glitz this is a great film to watch<SEP>1
i wasnt sure when i heard about this coming out i was thinking how dumb is disney getting i was wrong i found it to be very good i mean its not the lion king but its cool to see another side from a certain point it was very funny also it wasnt one of those corny disney sequels were the animation sucks it was just like the lion king animation the only thing that eritated me was the whole movie theater thing through out the movie not to give anything way but youll know what i am talking about i also fun that it was cool to have most of the cast from the original to return it was a very good movie over all<SEP>1
this story is about the romantic triangle between a nth african male prostitute a french transsexual prostitute stephanie and a russian waiter who speaks no french and never seems to shaveas a film it is dull dreary and depressing shot either on foggy overcast winter days or in badly lit interiors where everyone is bathed in a weird blue luminescence and yes i know its because the white balance was out everyone is pale and downcast and looks haggard shabby and dirty bodies are bony and shot in such closeup that they look quite ugly and unappealing moles greasy hair yuk bad news in a film where people spend a lot of time either naked or having sexand the story well stephanies mother is dying all three characters go back to stephanies home village where through a bunch of flashbacks to desolate countryside and predictably dingy interiors we see a bit of stephanies childhood as a boy called pierre the mother dies well and thats about it really character development is kept to a minimum as is the denouement of the story i suppose the storyline is not linear it would explain a lot of non sequiteurs but really after paying my seven euros i dont feel like having to construct the film myself: thats what the director takes my money for to expect me to join the story telling process and get my hands dirty so to speak is asking way too muchthis film is a heap of pretentious rubbish made above all from a desire to epater les bourgeois ie shock the straights i can see how it was a shoo-in for the berlin film festival and i can see why it got nowhere<SEP>0
lord alan cunninghamantonio de teffèis a nutjob{seen early on trying to escape an insane asylum} with this castle slowly succumbing to ruin likes to kill various hookers who resemble his deceased wife evelyn a woman who betrayed him for another man with those red locks this nutcase is quite wealthy and his bachelor status can be quite alluring he however is overrun by his obsession with his late wifes memoryspecifically her adulteryhe saw her naked with the lover while the memory of evelyn is almost devouring his whole existence alan tries his best to find true love and believes he has with gladysmarina malfatti who spends most of the film nakedthats probably her lone attribute since she isnt a very good actress who agrees to marry him after a very short courtship which should probably throw up flags right away{theres a key moment of dialogue where she knows exactly to the very amount what he is worth}the only real person alan can confide in is his doctor from the hospital dr richard timberlanegiacomo rossi-stuart there are other key characters in this film that revolve around alan alans cousin georgerod murdock seems to be quite a good friend who often supplies him victimsi mean dates while holding onto hope of getting his lords estate some day albertroberto maldera evelyns brother is a witness to alans slaughter and instead of turning him into the police squeezes him for cash aunt agathajoan c davis wheelchair bound lives at the castle estate and is often seen snooping around behind cracked doors we later find that she is having a love affair with albertall that is described above services the rest of the story which shows what appears to be the ghost of evelyn haunting alan someone is killing off members of the cast family that revolve around alan and the body of evelyn is indeed missingthe ultimate question is who is committing the crimes after alan and gladys are married where is evelyns body and will alan go over the edge i have to be honest and say i just didnt really care much for this film its badly uneven and the pacing is all over the place it looks great on the new dvd and the rising from the grave sequence is cool but what really hurts the film in my mind is that the entire cast is unlikable you really have a hard time caring for alan because he is a psychotic who is skating on thin ice in regards to holding his sanity he can be quite volatile who commits the crime really isnt that great a surprise for after several key characters are murdered off there arent but a choice few who could be doing it what happens to alan doesnt really make your throat gulp because you can make the argument hes just getting what he deserves those behind the whole scheme of the film in regards to alan as i pointed out before arent that shocking because if you are just slightly aware of certain circumstancesor advantages theyd havethat would benefit them with the collapse of alans sanity then everything just comes off less than stellar i thought the editing was choppy and unexciting but the acting from the entire cast is really below par some stylistics help and there is a sniff of gothic atmosphere in the graveyard sequences to help it some<SEP>0

i was browsing through netflix and stumbled upon this movie having fond memories of the book as a child i decided to check this out this is a movie that you should really pass onit is just not worth seeing it is very boring and uninteresting i feel that it would even be that way to small children it has no magic that the book contains this movie is not horrible but you will just find yourself not caring ten minutes into itthere are moments that just come off as weird the witch character is not very good the family acts like it is no big deal that these odd things are happening i know this is a kids movie so as an older audience we must not look too deeply in things but the whole movie just feels like it was written and produced by people who have never had any movie making experience beforethe dvd that i had began skipping in the final moments of the film and instead of trying to fix it i just turned it off and sent it back to netflix i really didnt care how it finished skip this film and read the book instead<SEP>0
this film has renewed my interest in french cinema the story is enchanting the acting is flawless and audrey tautou is absolutely beautiful i imagine that we will be seeing a lot more of her in the states after her upcoming role in amelie<SEP>1
this movie had potential and i was willing to give it a try but there are so many timeline problems that are so obvious - its hard to swallow being treated like such an idiotrise to power is set in the late sixties carlitos way is set in the mid to late seventies for this movie to be realistic it would have to be set in the fifties if not the late fortiesrise to power has no sign of gail pennelope ann miller no sign of kleinfeld no sign of rolando that carlito supposedly ran with in his hey-day none of the primary characters in the original film were in this movie were supposed to believe that carlito met all these people in the span of a few yearsrise to power ends with carlito walking down the beach talking about retiring in paradise which is what he wanted to do in the original film also the pre-quel creates the rocco and earl characters - whats supposed to happen with them since they are clearly not in carlitos way its also hard to understand how carlito could have the relationship with the italians he has in the original film watching the events of rise to power where are the taglialuccis in this film there is probably seven years between the two films and he spends five of them in prison its like trying to put a square plug into a round holeit is obvious that no one was interested in telling a good story and that they were more interested in making some bucks by making an average gangster film and throwing a character called carlito brigante into the story the film had some good moments but i think they would have been better off leaving this movie to stand by itself instead of trying to make it a prequel to carlitos wayif you feel determined to see this movie the only advice i can give is to not think of the movie as a linear pre-quel think of it like the spaghetti westerns with clint eastwoods man with no name in other words two movies that have the same character but arent necessarily connected with each other<SEP>0
omigosh this is seriously the scariest movie i have ever ever seen to say that i love horror movies would be an understatement and i have seen heaps considering the limited availability in new zealand thats quite a lot but never before have i had to sleep with the light onuntil i saw the grudgesome may say that it is a rip off of the ring both based on japanese horror movies both similar yet different story lines but the grudge holds its own as a terrifying movie - seeing at at the cinema i even screamed at a certain point in the moviethe acting is great particularly from the supporting characters - kadee strickland is fantastic and steals the show she is such an enthusiastic person jason behr is a real hottie and william mapother looks like he is having fun however while i am normally a fan of clea duvalls she doesnt really seem into this movie of the supporting characters hers probably got the most depth and back story but she doesnt seem like she is all there as for sarah michelle gellar well she stays about the same through all her films and roles doesnt she the ghosts were genuinely scary the music and sound effects were chilling particularly the noise being made when kadee stricklands character answered the phone in her apartment the ending was cool toosuper highly recommended 910<SEP>1
jason lee does his best to bring fun to a silly situation but the movie just fails to make a connect perhaps because julia stiles character seems awkward as the conniving and sexy soon to be cousin-in-law maybe it is because she and selma blairs characters should have been cast the opposite way selma blair seems more conniving than julia would beeither way this movie is yet another hollywood trivialization of a possibly real world situation that being getting caught with your pants out at your bachelor party not stooping your cousin which while having promise fails to deliverthere are some laughs to be sure and the cast even if miscast do their best with sub grade material which doesnt transcend its raunchy topic so instead of getting a successful raunch fest ie animal house or american pie we are left with a middle ground of part humor and part stupidity ala meatballs 2 or something<SEP>0

this is truly one from the golden age of hollywood the kind they do not make anymore it is an unique fun movie that keeps you guessing what is going to happen next all the actors are perfectly cast and they are all great supporting actors this is the first movie i saw with ronald colman in it and i have been a fan of his ever since reginald gardiner has always been a favorite supporting actor of mine and adds a certain quality to every movie he is in while he played a different kind of character here he still added something to the movie that another actor cast in this character would not have added<SEP>1

i cant believe i am so angry after seeing this that i am about to write my first ever review on imdbthis disney documentary is nothing but a rehashed planet earth lite now i knew going into this that it was advertised as from the people who brought you planet earth but i had no idea they were going to blatantly use the exact same cuts as the groundbreaking documentary mini-series i just paid $875 to see something i already own on dvd shame on disney for not warning people that there is absolutely nothing original here save a james earl jones voice-over and 90 seconds of sailfish that i dont believe were in planet earthbut the biggest crime of all is that while planet earth uses the tragic story of the polar bear as evidence that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for ecologic change disney took that story and turned it into family friendly tripe after the male polar bears demise they show his cubs grown significantly a year later and spew some garbage about how they are ready to carry on his memory and that the earth really is a beautiful place after all no mention of the grown cubs impending deaths due to the same plight their father endured no warning of trouble for future generations if we dont get our act together nothing just a montage of stuff we have already seen throughout the movie and many times more if you are one of the billion people who have already seen planet earthi have never left the theater feeling so ashamed and cheated in my life<SEP>0

this movie should not be watched as it was meant to be a flop ram gopal verma first wanted to make this a remake of classic bollywood movie sholay but after having problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and i guess leave all the good parts of the movie acting script songs music comedy action etc out and shoot the movie just because he already happen to hire the crew waste of money waste of time after making movies like rangeela satya and company he pulled a coppola godfather on us; what were you thinking rgv anyways the story is though hard to follow is almost like the old sholay ajay devgan playing heero beeru sholay and ajay new kid on the block playing ajay jaysholay both bad yet funny friends help a cop capture a bad guy first later in the movie now retired cop hires them as personal security and safeguarding from the hands of a very most wanted bubban played by amitabh bachan in case you havent been watching bollywood movies the good guys win in the end there i just saved you 3 precious hours of your life!<SEP>0

i have a thing for old black and white movies of this kind movies by will hay and abbot & costello especially as those are my favourites i picked this movie up on dvd as it was using the same idea as will hays oh mr porter which is one of the finest comedies ever made i just finished watching this movie less than ten minutes ago the movie finished at 12:45am i find that movies of this kind to do with ghost trains etc are best viewed at night time with the lights out that way you get into the storyline more and night time viewing works well with this moviethe one-liners in the movie may seem a little dated to some viewers i guess this depends on the viewer they are not dated to me though i am 28 and even though i am not old enough to have been around when this movie was first released my dad was though i still have a lot of appreciation for some of the old movies of this kind sitting in the room in front of the tv with some snacks and drinks and kicking back and relaxing at night while watching these movies not many things can beat the feeling you get while doing this it is an escape from reality for a whilei noticed that one of the men in the movie he has a black mustache he appears about three quarters of the way through the movie after his car crashes and he is looking for a woman he was followed to the station this man was in the will hay classic the ghost of st michaels as well just thought id point that out in case no one noticed :the set pieces in the movie are very atmospheric outside the abandoned station looks good and as if there is not a soul for miles in any direction and the inside of the station is very cosy looking away from the rain storm that is outside i felt like i would have loved to have been there in the movie with the cast the atmosphere in this movie is something that is missing from a lot of movies now it keeps you hooked from the moment the movie starts till it finisheswe need more of this type of movie in todays market but sadly it could be over looked in favour of movies with nudity and swearing and crude humour this sort of movie making era the ghost train oh mr porter etc to me is the golden age of cinema!<SEP>1
this film is a portrait of the half-spastic teenage boy benjamin who has to visit a boarding school because of his lousy marks in math he didnt make the best experiences in life before and got serious self-esteem issues after a rough start at his new school he starts making friends falls in love with a girl and does some american pieish teenage stuffbeside some comedy elements the film is told in a very serious way focussing on benjamin and his problemsif you already dont like this story outline save your time and watch something else if you do please be aware of the following:1 benjamin is a total loser whatever he does he does it terribly wrong and then he goes for self-pity all the time for me he wasnt that kind of charming loser who you can feel sympathy for and laugh with instead he and his behavior really annoyed me and with my own teenage years not so far behind i could barely stand watching2 the film hardly tries to be realistic and the story seems to be but from my experience the characters just arent except for janosch maybe and yes i know this film is based on an auto-biography written by a 17-year old - but having some experiences with german schools and german youth myself i dont believe him3 showing the sexual awakening really is an important thing for a film with this subject but i doubt that teenage boys do an ejaculate on the cookie-contest where everyone has to hit a cookie with his sperm during mass-masturbation in the woods and the loser has to eat the sperm-wet cookie afterwards although it kinda amused me in a contemptible way its nor funny neither underlining the serious attempts of this film4 theres a sub-plot about benjamins family and his father betraying his wife - still i dont know why its there and where to put it it just bored mewell i personally hated this film for having the character of benjamin being without a message concept scheme whatever and its failing attempts to be dramatic and serious however i can image that some people may find it sensible and touching if you liked the other sister youll probably like this one too i hated both17-year old boys shouldnt write an autobiography and if they do it doesnt seem to be the best idea to make a film out of it2 out of 10<SEP>0
i generally find loretta young hard to take too concerned with her looks and too ladylike in all the wrong ways but in this lyrical frank borzage romance and even though shes playing a low-self-esteem patsy who puts up with entirely too much bullying from paramour spencer tracy shes direct and honest and irresistible its an odd little movie played mostly in a one-room shack in a hooverville unusually up-front about the depression yet romantic and idealized tracy playing a blustery hard-to-take regular guy who would be an awful chauvinist and bully by todays standards softens his characters hard edge and almost makes him appealing theres good supporting work from marjorie rambeau and glenda farrell who never got as far as she should have and jo swerlings screenplay is modest and efficient but the real heroes are borzage who always liked to dramatize true love in lyrical close-up and young you sort of want to slap her and tell her character to wise up shes too good for this guy but shes so dewy and persuasive you contentedly watch their story play out to a satisfying conclusion<SEP>1
the robin cook novel coma had already been turned into a pretty successful movie in 1978 a couple of years later it was the turn of another robin cook bestseller to get the big screen treatment but in the case of sphinx virtually everything that could go wrong does go wrong this is a dreadful adventure flick consisting of wooden performances stupid dialogue unconvincing characters and leaden pacing the only reason it escapes a 1-out-of-10 rating is that the egyptian backdrop provides infinitely more fascination than the story itself hard to believe franklin j schaffner of patton and planet of the apes is the director behind this debaclepretty egyptologist erica baron lesley anne-down is on a working vacation in cairo when she stumbles across the shop of antiques dealer abdu-hamdi john gielgud hamdi befriends erica and is impressed by her enthusiasm and knowledge consequently he shows her a beautiful and incredibly rare statue of pharoah seti i that he is keeping secretly in his shop the very existence of the statue arouses intense excitement in erica for it could provide vital clues in locating seti is long-lost tomb a prize as great as the discovery of tutankhamuns tomb in 1922 before hamdi can tell erica any more he is brutally murdered in his shop with erica watching in silent terror as he meets his grisly end afraid yet tantalised by what she has seen erica attempts to track down the treasure she finds herself helped and hindered in her quest by various other parties none of whom are truly trustworthy for one there is yvon maurice ronet seemingly a friend but perhaps a man with sinister ulterior motives then there is akmed khazzan frank langella an egyptian for whom erica feels a certain attraction but who may also be hiding dangerous secrets from herthe biggest problems with sphinx generally result from its total disregard for plausibility down couldnt be less convincing as a female egyptologist  one assumes she would be quite well-educated and resourceful yet she spends the entire film screaming helplessly like some busty bimbo from a teen slasher flick on those rare occasions that she actually isnt running from a potential villain she does other brainless things such as taking polaroid flash photos in a 4000 year old tomb! the plot twists are heavy-handed to say the least mainly comprising of revelations and double-crosses that can be predicted well in advance one cant even try to enjoy the film on the level of dumb but entertaining action fare because the pacing is awfully sluggish what little action can be found is separated by long stretches of tedium a famous review of the movie declared: sphinx stinks! never before has a 2-hour film been so aptly summed up in 2 words<SEP>0
the film is side spliting from the outset eddie just seems to bring that uniqueness to the stage and makes the most basic thing funny from having an ice cream as a child to the long old tradition of the family get together the film is very rare in this country but unsure of availability in other countries i have searched through a lot of web sites and still no luck phoned companies that search for rare videos and there are year waiting lists for it so hints are very welcome if any one likes eddie murphy as a comedian and sees the video get itit is worth the money and cant go far wrong<SEP>1
a matter of life and death what can you really say that would properly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film powell and pressburgers visual imagination knows no bounds every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions the switches between the bold colours of the real world to the stark black and white of heaven is ingenious showing us visually just how much more vibrant life is the final court scene is also fantastic as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over peter david nivens operation all of the performances are spot on roger livesey being a standout and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful never has there been a more romantic film than this if there has i havent seen it a matter of life and death is all about the power of love and just how important life is and jack cardiffs cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone the way he lights kim hunters face makes her all the more beautiful what a genius he can make a simple things such as a game of table tennis look exciting and the sound design is also impeccable; the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision way ahead of its timethis is a true classic that can restore anyones faith in cinema under appreciated on its initial release and by todays audiences but one of my all time favourites which is why i give this film a 1010 in a word - beautiful<SEP>1
1 is being pretty generous here i really enjoyed boogeyman even though it is not really the boogeyman promoted on the dvd cover and we all know it! it creeped me out but this film it is something else for being directed by a guy who has been around a long time and directed a lot of movies it looks like it was shot on a vhs camcorder by a 10 year old! the story and acting are atrocious! david hess you have let me down too after playing one of the most menacing villains in film history you have resorted to this the story and acting may have been able to be forgiven however if anyone had taken the time to make the video look somewhat professional there are a lot of shot on video films out there that dont look like it or at least arent so obvious that it detracts your attention from the film i cant say it is the worst movie ever because i couldnt make it through the entire film but it is certainly close<SEP>0
this is the biggest pile of crap i have ever watched do not rent! the makers of this movie should be band from ever making another movie it starts with some what of a plot then fades fast to nothing i think i would rather watch paint dry then to as much as looking at the cover the actors were awful the plot faded fast filming left to much work to be done not one good thing to say about this crap movie if you rent this movie you will waste your money i really enjoy national lampoon movies but this was a waste of time learn to write learn to act learn to produce and learn to direct i feel i should sue these a-holes that made this movie for money wasted on rental cost and time lost<SEP>0
jeff lowell has written & directed over her dead body poorly the idea is first of all is as stale as my jokes and the execution is just a cherry on the cakeminus eva longoria parker there is hardly anything appealing in this film eva looks great as ever and delivers a likable performancepaul rudd looks jaded and least interested lake bell is a complete miscast she looks manly and delivers a strictly average performance jason biggs is wasted so is lindsay sloanei expected entertainment more from this film sadly i didnt get entertained<SEP>0
the film is based on a genuine 1950s noveljournalist colin mcinnes wrote a set of three london novels: absolute beginners city of spades and mr love and justice i have read all three the first two are excellent the last perhaps an experiment that did not come off but mcinness work is highly acclaimed; and rightly so this musical is the novelists ultimate nightmare - to see the fruits of ones mind being turned into a glitzy badly-acted soporific one-dimensional apology of a film that says it captures the spirit of 1950s london and does nothing of the sortthank goodness colin mcinnes wasnt alive to witness it<SEP>0
when i was younger i really enjoyed watching bad television weve all been guilty of it at some time or another but my excuse for watching things like buck rogers in the 25th century and silver spoons is this: i was young and naive; ignorant of what makes a show really worthwhilethankfully i now appreciate the good stuff stargate sg-1 is not good the 12 year-old me would love every hackneyed bit of it every line of stilted dialogue every bit of needless technobabble the writing is beyond insipid; so bland and uninspired it makes one miss star trek: voyager if your show makes me long for the worst trek show ever youre in troublethe film stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure anchored by two solid performances by james spader and kurt russell full of fascinating egyptian architecture and culture a wonderful musical score and cool sci-fi ideas with the exception of a little of the original music none of what made the film fun appears in this show even richard dean anderson who made macgyver watchable and legend interesting seems like hes half asleep most episodesthe budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like somebodys basement the cinematography isnt much better as vanilla and dull as the scripts it amazes me that shows with a lot more style like farscape and substance like the reimagined battlestar galactica have smaller less rabid fanbases than this pap it just doesnt deserve it<SEP>0
i found the storyline in this movie to be very interesting best of all it left out the usual sex and violence theyre getting old inserted in many movies the movie was well done in its flashbacks to days gone by in that area of the southwest the acting was also superb<SEP>1
mr blandings builds his dream house may be the best frank caprapreston sturges movie neither man ever made! if you love bringing up baby the philadelpia story the thin man i was a male war bride or its a wonderful life - movies made with wit taste and and the occasional tongue firmly panted in cheek check this one out post wwii life is simply and idyllically portrayedgrant is at the absolute top of his form playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a country squire loy is adorable as his pre-now wife the cast of supporting characters compares to you cant take it with you and contains an early bit by future tarzan lex barker art direction and editing are way above parthe movie never stoops to the low-rent by-the-numbers venal slapstick of the later adaptation the money pit<SEP>1
saw this film yesterday for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it im a student of screen writing and i loved the way the minor characters intervened just when something pivotalclimatic happened in a scene i thought the dialogue was very sharp and the premise of story is rather shocking - at one particular point barbara stanwyck is openly flirting with her daughters boyfriend; and rekindling some passion in her husband whom she hasnt seen in ten years; and with the gunshot signal two shots and then one she hooks up with her old shag mate dutch the reason she left town in the first place! all at the same time! the moral majority must have been totally incensed when they saw this flick back in the 50slove the costumes and cinematography and the straight from the hip dialogue - just to watch barbara stanwyck and co doing the bunny hug is good enough reason to rent this film on dvdone of the best films from that period ive seen in a long time<SEP>1
if the creators of this film had made any attempt at introducing reality to the plot it would have been just one more waste of time money and creative effort fortunately by throwing all pretense of reality to the winds they have created a comedic marvel who could pass up a film in which an alien pilot spends the entire film acting like jack nicholson complete with the lakers t-shirt do not dismiss this film as trash<SEP>1
two warring shop workers in a leather-goods store turn out to be secret sweethearts as they correspond under box-number aliases within this simple idea and an everyday setting lubitsch produces a rich tapestry of wit drama poignancy and irony that never lets up stewart and sullavan are perfect as the average couple with real emotions and tensions and the rest of the well-developed characters have their own sub-plots and in-jokes although wrongly eclipsed by stewarts big films of 3940 destry philadelphia story mr smith this is easily on a par and we enjoy a whole range of acting subtlties unseen in the other films<SEP>1
i had never heard of leos carax until his merde segment in last years tokyo and his was easily the stand-out the films three stories it wasnt my favorite of the shorts but it was the most unique and the most iconic the lovers on the bridge was the first of his full length features ive seen a virtuoso romantic film that uses image and music to communicate an exuberant young love that overflows into the poetic though hes classified as a neo-nouvelle vogue his films owe as much to silent cinema as the 60s experimental narratives his movies are closer to jean vigo in latlante jean cocteau and guy maddin than godard and truffautin boy meets girl caraxs 1984 debut he uses black and white and the heavy reliance on visual representation to display emotional states he combines the exaggerated worlds of maddin but based in a reality that never seems quite stable like cocteau but by virtue of its expressions it becomes more accessible emotional and engaging like vigos moviesthe story of boy meets girl is simple and similar to caraxs two following films which comprise this young lovers trilogy a boy named alex played by denis lavant who plays a character named alex in caraxs next two movies has just been dumped by his girlfriend who has fallen in love with his best friend in the first scene he nearly kills his friend on a boardwalk but stops short of murder he walks around reminded of her by sounds of his neighbors having sex and daydreams of his girlfriend and best friend getting intimate he steals records for her and leaves them at his friends apartment but avoids contacting either of them directly he wanders around and finds his way to a party where he meets a suicidal young woman and the film becomes part breathless and part limelightlater he is advised by an old man with sign language to speak up for yourselfyoung people today its like they forgot how to talk the old man gives an anecdote about working in the days of silent film and how an actor timid off stage became a confident lion when in front of the camera heres where the movie tips its hand but the overt reference to silent film is a crucial scene since it overlaps the style of the film silent and expressionist with the content a lovelorn young man trying to work up the courage to say and do the things he really wants to though alex is pensive at first and a torrent of romantic words tumbling out of him by the end he is the shy actor who becomes a lion thanks to the films magnification of his inward feelings which arent easy to nail down from moment to moment aside from a desire to fall in lovethere is a scene in the film where alex retreats from the party into a room where the guests have stashed their children and babies all crying in a chorus that fills that room until he turns on a tape of a childrens show making them fall silent unexpectedly due a glitch the tv ends up playing a secret bathroom camera which reveals the hostess sobbing to herself into her wig about someone she misses even as carax is self-reflexive and self deprecating of the very kind of angst ridden coming of age tale he is trying to tell the room full of whining infants hes mature enough to see through the initial irony to the lovelorn in everything the film crosses even the rich old bell of the ball has a brother she misses in another scene an ex astronaut stares at the moon he once walked on in his youth while sipping a cocktail in silencethough indebted to films before talkies carax is a master of music knowing when to pipe in the dead kennedys holiday in cambodia or an early david bowie song the sounds of a man playing piano or of a girl softly hummingin boy meets girl when someone gets their heart broken we see blood pour from their shirt when a couple kiss on the sidewalk they spin 360 degrees as if attached to a carousel when alex enters a party an feels out of place its because the most interesting people in the world really are in attendance; like the famous author who cant speak because of a bullet lodged in his brain or the miss universe of 1950 standing just across from the astronaut this film is the missing link between jean piere jenuet michel gondry and wes anderson whose stylistic flourishes and quirky tales of whimsy all have a parallel with different visuals musical and emotional cues in these carax moviesevery line of dialog every piece of music and every effect and edit in this movie resonated with me on some emotional level some i lack words to articulate there are many tales of a boy meeting a girl but rather than just explore the banal details of any particular event this movie captures the ecstatic truth of adolescent passion and disappointment the other movies you want to watch can wait see this first if i were to make films i would want them to be like this in fact i wish all films were like this where the ephemeral becomes larger than life and life itself becomes a dream<SEP>1
this is a straight-to-video movie so it should go without saying that its not going to rival the first lion king but that said this was downright goodmy kids loved this but thats a given they love anything thats a cartoon the big shock was that *i* liked it too it was laugh out loud funny at some parts even the fart jokes* had lots of rather creative tie-ins with the first movie and even some jokes that you had to be older to understand but without being risqué like in shrek [do you think hes compensating for something]a special note on the fart jokes i was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just toilet noises in fact there were almost no noisesimagery at all the references were actually rather subtle they actually had a setuppunchlineetc and were almost in good taste id like my kids to think that theres more to humor than going to the bathroom and this movie is fine in those regardshmm what else the music was so-so not nearly as creative as in the first or second movie but plenty of fun for the kids no painfully corny moments which was a blessing for me a little action but nothing too scary the secret of nimh gave my kids nightmares not sure a g rating was appropriate for that oneall in all id say this is a great movie for kids of any age one thats 100% safe to let them watch i try not to be overly sensitive but ive had to jump up and turn off the tv during a few movies that were less kid-appropriate than expected - but youre safe to leave the room during this one id say stick around anyway though you might find that you enjoy it too :<SEP>1
i often feel like scrooge slamming movies that others are raving about - or i write the review to balance unwarranted raves i found this movie almost unwatchable and unusual for me was fast-forwarding not only through dull clichéd dialog but even dull clichéd musical numbers whatever originality exists in this film -- unusual domestic setting for a musical lots of fantasy some animation -- is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thought-provoking plot development individually june haver and dan dailey appear to be nice people but cant carry a movie as a team neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal theyre both bland i like billy gray but his character is pretty one-note the best part of the film to me are june havers beautiful costumes and great body<SEP>0
cillian murphy and rachel mcadams star in this actionthriller written and directed by the master of suspense wes craven himself the whole movie starts with some trouble at the lux atlantic a hotel in miami the problem is all fixed by lisa reisert the manager of the hotel then she goes to the airport and thats where all of the trouble begins she meets jackson rippner who doesnt like to be called jack because of the name jack the ripper if you know you him and i mean then they board the plane and crazy enough rippner and reisert sit next to each other for the next half-hour lisa is terrorized tormented and terrified by rippner i wont give anything away then we move on to where jack is chasing lisa in the airport then lisa goes to her house to see if her father is okay and crazily enough rippner is already there there is nearly twelve minutes of violence and strong intensity throughout that entire scene in total about 25 minutes of intense action comes at the endnot only was the movie intense but it had a great plot to it like i said i will not give anything away because its so shocking and thrilling and somewhat disturbingfrightening and the acting from every single character in the movie even the ones with no lines at all were all pitch perfect it was incredible everything was awesome in this movie! the acting the music the effects the make-up the directing the editing the writing everything was wonderful! wes craven is definitely the master of suspense red eye is definitely a must-see and is definitely worth spending your money on you could watch this movie over and over and over again and it would never ever get boringred eye i have to say is better than 10 out of 10 starsoriginal mpaa rating: pg-13: some intense sequences of violence and languagemy mpaa rating: pg-13: some very intense sequences of violence and languagemy canadian rating: 14a: violence frightening scenes disturbing content<SEP>1
as you probably already know jess franco is one prolific guy hes made hundreds upon hundreds of films many of which are crap however he managed to sneak in an occasionally quality work amongst all the assembly line exploitation succubus isnt his best work thats either the diabolical dr z or vampyros lesbos but it has many of his trademarks that make it a must for anyone interested in diving into his large catalog he combines the erotic alternating between showing full-frontal nudity and leaving somethings left to the imagination and the surreal seamlessly this is a very dreamlike film full of great atmosphere i particularly liked the constant namedropping despite coming off as being incredibly pretentious its amusing to hear all of francos influencesstill there are many users who dont like succubus and i can see where theyre coming from its leisurely paced but i can deal with that more problematic is the incoherency the script here was obviously rushed and within five minutes into the film i had absolutely no idea what was going on and it never really came together from that point on those who want some substance with their style look elsewhere also if its a horror film it never really becomes scary or even suspenseful still i was entertained by all the psychedelic silliness that i didnt really mind these major flaws all too much 710<SEP>1

i picked up this video after reading the text on the box the story seemed good and it had keanu reeves! but after 5 minutes of watching i noticed how horrible his acting was he walks and talks so stupid the whole time its fake and not convincing it doesnt end there almost all the characters act so badly its laughable the only acceptable acting was by alan boyce david but the guy commits suicide early on and you dont see him again you never even know why he did it! everything about this movie screams low quality i cant believe how such a thing gets released! i was tempted many times to stop watching in fact i did half way through it i decided to stop watching and turned the thing off came to the imdb to check what others thought about it i found zero comments not surprised so i decided to force myself to handle the pain and go back to finish it then come here to comment on it the only good thing going for me was the high-school rock band theme the occasional guitar playing and singing parts but thats not worth itvery bad acting and directing terrible movie<SEP>0
i guess that gunslinger wasnt quite as god-awful as most of the movies that mystery science theater 3000 shows but westerns just arent roger cormans forte portraying rose hood beverly garland becoming sheriff in an old west town after her sheriff husband gets murdered and having to fight off baddies the movie is pretty predictable john ireland is roses new hubby secretly working for unctuous allison hayes yes the 50-foot woman also appearing briefly is frequent corman co-star dick miller as a mailman miller nowadays stars in joe dantes moviesi do wish to assert that youll probably want to watch the mst3k version to really enjoy this movie they had a great time with it<SEP>0
this police procedural is no worse than many others of its era and better than quite a few obviously it is following in the steps of dragnet and naked city but emerges as an enjoyable programmer the best thing about it is the unadorned look it provides into a world now long gonethe lower class new york of the late 40searly 50s here it is in all its seedy glory from the old-school tattoo parlors to the cheap hotels to the greasy spoons these old police films are like travelogues to a bygone era and very bittersweet to anybody who dislikes the sanitized soulless cityscape of todayalso intriguing is the emphasis on the nuts-and-bolts scientific aspect of solving the crimein this case the murder of a tattooed woman found in an abandoned car our main heroes detectives tobin and corrigan do the footwork but without the tedious and painstaking efforts of the lab boys theyd get nowhere although the technology is not in the same league the cops here use the dogged persistence of a csi investigator to track down their manthe way some reviewers have written about this movie you think it would have been directed by ed wood and acted by extras from his movies what bosh! i enjoyed john miles as the gangly ex-marine turned cop tobinhe had a happy-go-lucky easy-going approach to the role thats a welcome change from the usual stone-faced histrionics of most movie cops of the period patricia barry is cute and delightful as his perky girlfriend who helps solve the crime walter kinsella is stuffy and droll as the older detective corrigan i rather liked the chemistry of these two and it made for something a bit different than the sort of robotic dragnet approachthe mystery itself is not too deep and the final chase and shoot-out certainly wont rank amongst the classics of crime cinema but during its brief running time the tattooed stranger more than held my interest<SEP>1
in this movie joe pesci slams dunks a basketball joe pesciand being consistent the rest of the script is equally not believablepesci is a funny guy which saves this film from sinking int the absolute back of the cellar but the other roles were pretty bad the father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people which wasnt even well-played instead of the man being an archetypal villain he seemed more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs then theres the token piece that is assigned to pesci as a girlfriend or somethingi dont even remembershe was that forgettableanyone who rates this movie above a 5 or 6 is a paid member of some sort of film studio trying to up the reputation of this sunken film or at least one of those millions of media minions who cant critique efficiently you know the people who feel bad if they give anything a mark below 6stay awayfar away and shame on comedy central where i saw this film they usually pick better<SEP>0
do not be mistaken this is neither a horror nor really a film i firmly advise against watching this 82 minute failure; the only reason it merited a star was the presence of chris pinenothing happens you wait patiently in the hope that there may be a flicker of a twist a hint of surprise a plot to emerge - but nothe characters take erratic turns of pace in their actions and yet dont have the time to develop - thanks to the thrifty editors and frankly ashamed writers - before returning to an idyllic and playful bring on the teen rock montage state the only thing that could have made it worse would be adding the perishable token ethnic companiontheir encounters with obstacles be they human or physical are brief confusing and entirely pointlesschris pine fights to keep himself above the surface whilst being drowned by a misery of a lightweight cast lou taylor pucci couldnt be dryer if he spent the summer with keanu reaves combing the navada desertwatch the road watch 28 days later watch day time tvanything but this; i implore you suffer the boredom unlike you may be led to believe in the film this film is no cure<SEP>0
can we say retarded this girl has no talent what so ever nothing but complete garbage you people are just marking 10 stars because you know most people hate this pathetic woman if its such a great show then why did it get canceled after 6 measly episodes exactly people that support her please seek help you do not know what is funny her stand up comedy is just so stupid seriously how do you find this trash funny the show tries to poke fun at stereo types and other things that are not funny at all carlos mencia is funny and to that stupid poster he actually has fans and his show is on the air so im sorry your a redneck who doesent get his jokes please give me my 20 minutes of my life back<SEP>0
i was eager to see mr fix it because im a huge david boreanaz fan what i got though was a 1-12 hour nap the premise seemed enjoyable: boreanaz is lance valenteen proprietor of a business called mr fix it where dumped men enlist his help to get their girlfriends to take them backamong the problems with this movie are the editing script and acting although ive found boreanaz delightful in his other film roles with the exception of that crow movie he did this was disappointing at times his character was interesting and others flat the supporting cast reminded me of soap opera day players i realize it wasnt a big-budget film but some of the scene cuts and music just didnt seem rightmy advice: watch at your own risk<SEP>0
ok - as far as the 2 versions of this movie there were 2 people involved in the making - john korty and bill couterie george was just the producer - he really didnt have any kind of say so in the film - just helped with money - the adult version was made possible by bill couterie john korty didnt like or approve this version as it was done behind his back thanks to ladd films going under they didnt advertise this movie and threw all their advertising cash for the right stuff hoping it would pull them through; and it didnt so this movie never really had a chance when twice made it to cable hbo - they showed the reels with bills version and john threatened to sue if it was shown anymore did you notice how the adult version wasnt on for very long showtime got the clean version the version on the videotape and laser-disc is the version approved by john who holds more power than bill its a pity really as the adult version is actually better and does make more sense but its very doubtful that it will ever be released in that version onto dvd or any other format short of bootleg sorry to disappoint everyone i know all this info as i used to be the president of the twice upon a time fan club still have numerous items from the movie - used to own a letter-boxed version of the adult version but it was stolen - only have a partial hbo copy of it now 8 stars to the adult version - 5 to the clean version any other questions just ask<SEP>1
the single worst film ive ever seen in a theater i saw this film at the austin film festival in 2004 and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival it was an interesting premise and seemed like it could go somewhere but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything first of all if youre going to do a musical find someone with musical talent the music consisted of cheesy piano playing that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming the lyrics were terribly written and when they werent obvious rhymes they were groan-inducing rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to try to make this movie work and youd think youd find people who could sing when making a musical right not in this case luckily they were half talkinghalf singing in rhyme most of the time but when they did sing it made me cringe especially when they attempted to sing in harmony and that just addresses the music some of the acting was pretty good but a lot of the dialog was terrible as well as most of the scenes they obviously didnt have enough coverage on the scenes or they just had a bad editor because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook of making it a musical i hope the investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again<SEP>0
i first saw this when it was picked as a suggestion from my tivo system i like danny elfman and thought it might be interesting on top of that im a fan of max fleischers work and this started out with the look and feel of his 30s cartoon with both of those i thought it would hold my interest i was wrong just a few minutes in and i had the fast forward button down i ran through it in about 15 minutes and thought that was itafterwards i read some of the other reviews here and figured i didnt give it enough of a chance i recorded it again and watched it through theres 75 minutes of my life im not getting backi cant believe there arent more bad reviews personally i think its because its hard to get to the 10 line comment minimum how many ways are there to say this is a waste of timethe movie comes across as though it was made by a few junior high kids ready to outrage the world and thinking they can with breasts profanity and puke jokes the characters are flat the parody of swinging the alphabet is lame essentially cobbling the tune getting through a - e hitting the obvious profanity a f and then having no idea where to go the trip through the intestines to the expected landing doesnt work the first time let alone the following ones across the board the entire movie is what you would expect from someone trying to out-south park stone and parker without the ability to determine what is and isnt funny this might be amusing if youre high otherwise its not<SEP>0

a solid if unremarkable film matthau as einstein was wonderful my favorite part and the only thing that would make me go out of my way to see this again was the wonderful scene with the physicists playing badmitton i loved the sweaters and the conversation while they waited for robbins to retrieve the birdie<SEP>1

the first episode i saw of lost made me think i thought what is this some people who crashed and get chased by a giant monster but its not like that its far more than thatbecause their is no monster at all and every episode that you see of lost well its getting better every time a deserted island with an underground bunker and especially the connection between the people who crossed paths with each other before they crashed thats the real secretthis series rules and i cant wait to know whats really going on there i hope that they dont air the last 2 episodes in the theatersthis series deserves a 9 out of 10<SEP>1
as i sat in front of the tv watching this movie i thought oh what alfred hitchcock or even brian depalma could have done with this! chances are you will too it does start out intrigueing a british park ranger living in los angeles collin firth marries a pretty demure brunette woman lisa zane whom he met in a park only a short time ago then one day she dissappears the police are unable to find any documentation that she ever existed and firth conducts his own search so far so good just as hes about to give up he turns to his womanizing best friend billy zane and they stumble onto her former life in las sordid underground of drugs nightclubs and ametuer filmmaking and then to her history of mental instability at that point firths life is in danger and the film falls apart none of the characters from lisa zanes past are remotely interesting the film moves slowly and theres very little action there is a subplot regarding missing drug money but its just a throwaway no chases no cliffhanging sequences and no suspense just some dull beatings and a lot of chat by boring characters one thing worth noting lisa zane and billy zane are brother and sister but they never appear in a scene together by the end of the movie youre torn between wondering what might have been and trying to stay awake<SEP>0
do not bother to waste your money on this movie do not even go into your car and think that you might see this movie if any others do not appeal to you if you must see a movie this weekend go see batman againthe script was horrible perfectly written from the random horror movie format given: a place in confined spaces a madman with various weapons a curious man who manages to uncover all of the clues that honest police officers cannot put together and an innocent and overly curious yet beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would love to be able to call their girlfriend mix together add much poorly executed gore and what the hell lets put some freaks in there for a little spin to the plotthe acting was horrible and the characters unbelievable - borat was more believable than this***spoiler***and can someone please tell me how a butchers vest can make a bullet ricochet from the person after being shot without even making the person who was shot flinch im in the army we need that kind of stuff for ourselves1 out of 10 and i would place it in the decimals of that rounded up to give it the lowest possible score i can<SEP>0
the woman in black is fantastic in all aspects its scary suspenseful and so realistic that you can actually see it happening in real life i first saw this on the tv back in 1989 and with all the lights off and the volume turned up it was probably the most creepy experience of my entire life i managed to get hold of a copy and now i make sure to bring it out every halloween and show it too unsuspecting family members who have no idea what theyre in for and all i can do is laugh with glee as for the film:it starts out with a young lawyer named arthur kipps who is assigned by his firm to go to the market town of crythin gifford to settle the papers of a recently deceased client - mrs alice drablow this film starts off as a reasonably solid and interesting ghost story but then arthur attends the funeral and from that scene on we do not feel safe we are constantly on edge and biting our nails and that goes on for the next hour or so until the final thrilling finalea warning to all new viewers though: do not watch this alone<SEP>1
i was china in this film i choose the screen name sheeba alahani because i was modeling at the time in italy and they couldnt pronounce my real name correctly so i choose sheeba and then added alahani since it was similar to alohalanii had never acted before and it shows but it was so much fun to film they gave me acting lessons each morning which obviously were not useful they dubbed my voice thank goodnessdavid and peter were a blast on the set full of good humor and jokes this film was never meant to be taken seriously it was a tax write off according to inside information i give it a 1 because i have a sense of humor but a 10 for the fun i had acting in it<SEP>0

a very straight nice old lady desperate for money to save her house and possessions grows pot in her house smokes it with a few old-biddy friends and then sells it thats the story for this low-key comedy emphasizing the absurdity of the situation and some of the humor the predicament brings for much of the film it works the humor isnt of the laugh-out-loud variety but it does keep you entertained for an hour-and-a- half so i guess it serves its purposethere are funny moments and brenda blethyn is fun to watch in the lead role but the ending really ruined a cute movie with insultingly-bad messages that only the ultra-liberals of the film world would like to see happenlike most people i would prefer a happy ending too but it should not all warm and fuzzy for those who blatantly break the law also in here are the typical 1 children out of wedlock but that poses no problem and is deemed okay; 2 clerics portrayed as morally weak people; and 3 even a medical doctor who gets stoned too! hello and reviewers here blast hollywood this is exhibit a how a secular society has lowered the standards in the uk and europe in general hey people: at least have a trace of morality instead of nothing but a timothy leary if it feels good do it message<SEP>0
i couldnt believe how lame & pointless this was basically there is nothing to laugh at in the movie hardly any scenes to get you interested in the rest of the movie this movie pulled in some huge stars but they were all wasted in my opinion i think keanu reeves mustve taken some acting lessons a fews years after this movie before he stared in the matrix uma thurman looked very simple & humble luckily i got this movie for a very low price because its certainly not a movie to remember for any good reasons i wont write anything about the story of the movie but as you should know that she is meant to be the most famous hitchhiker across america because of her huge thumb i would give this movie a 2 10 before i watched this movie i was wondering why this movie has only got a 4010 & now i know why a very disappointing movie dont buy it even if you see it for under $5<SEP>0
dog days is one of most accurate films ive ever seen describing life in modern cities its very harsh and cruel at some points and sadly its very close to reality isolation desperation deep emotional dead ends problematic affairs perversion complexes madness all the things that are present in the big advanced cities of today it makes you realize once again the pityful state in which people have lead society the negative side of life in the city was never pictured on screen so properly i only wish it was a lie unfortunately it isnt therefore1010<SEP>1
well i like to be honest with all the audiences that i bought it because of kiras sex scenes but unfortunately i did not see much of them all sex scenes were short and done in haphazard manner along with all the weird and corny background music just like all other b movies - it just doesnt look much like two people having sex there is a tiny bit of plot toward the end - kiras new lover is a killer whoa!!! how shocking!!! why dont we nominate this movie for oscar award i cant imagine how bad the movie would look like if it were r-rated mine is imported from uk rated 18 conclusion put it down and walk away so yon wont end up with being a moron like mescore: 210<SEP>0
one of the most provocative films ever with excellent cinematography backed up by mc clarens lisp and stunning quote do you believe in love at first sitea trace of expressionism was evident in this picture further catapulting the films flawless integrity gabby aka joey played by eva longoria clearly loved the movie and role she played so much that she couldnt even be bothered giving it mention in her filmography lolthe best part of the movie would have to be without a doubt the heroic rescue by mc clure as he saved the young handicapped kid with the speech impediment which i may add was acted to perfection! james cahiils use of sound effects is unmatched even to this day the drug bust he performs early in the film is pain stakingly realistic when i watched this movie for the first time i was so compelled with the intense lack of respect for the gang inthused brothers from the southside gang and the ctm cut throat mafia this was by far one of the most encapsulating crevice cahill has committed to filmingpersonally this film holds sentimental value to me and i will be downloading it in the near future thats if i can find it anywhere lol!<SEP>1
having just seen this on tmc its fresh in my mind its obvious that while the stooges are featured stars they dont really run the show first theyre broken into 2 groups - moe as shorty and larry and curly as a pair of vagrants so theres not a whole lot of full team work the love story that fuels the plot is uninteresting the two ladies are the only ones with any acting ability theres another group of musical stooges that are unfunny unless you consider their attempts at being funny to be sadly buffoonish the music is tiresome they drive cars to the ranch and then depend on horses the dorky western wear is silly and theres an awful lot of the movie with no stooges on camera by the way this is obviously after curleys first stroke and his reduced energy level is clear vernon dent appears early on in an uncredited role i loved everything these guys ever did including all the non-curley stuff but this little dogie is pretty lousy<SEP>0
one can deal with historical inaccuracies but this film was just too much practically nothing was even close to truth and even for the era it was seen as sillyin defense of ford it was revealed on an old talk show that he was operating on the story as told to him by the real wyatt earp who was obviously old senile and replayed the scene his own way earp told the director about the stagecoach and how it was planned to happen during the stagecoach arrival so despite what other historians claim wyat himself asserts that it was premeditatedthis movie portrays earp as an honest man and also his brothers history doesnt exactly say they were or werent most people like to interject a bit of deceit and lawlessness into their characters but that is nothing new the truth is probably closer to them being the law abiding sorts of gunfight at the ok corral men who saw it as a career and believe me in the old west you didnt have time to think about too much elsecharacters that dont exist characters depicted dying at the corral who really didnt all make this a weaker film it is further weakened by mature who really didnt make a convincing doc he may be the worst cast choice ever for doc but at the same time we must remember that older movies were closer to the era and closer to a feel for the truth after all ford did get information first hand from wyatt earpit is also weakened by the all so predictable events involving the mexican girl hollywood was very pro nazi in those days and ready to kill off brunette women in very predictable fashion to show their patronage to hitler idealism this occurs in most movies until the eighties it is no excuse and does cheapen the art howeverthe actors who play the earps do well and brennan is always a thrill in fact mature may be the only acting downside of this flick still it is the weakest of the old ok corral movies<SEP>0
this tv film tells the story of extrovert frannie suddenly returning to silk hope to visit friends and family but unaware of her mothers death her sister runs the family home but is intending to sell it and move away with her new husband frannie strongly objects to the idea and vows to keep the family heirloom as it were by getting a job and maintaining responsibilityin comes handsome ruben and the two soon fall in love as you do and its from this point that i sort of lost interestthere is more to farrah fawcett than just the blonde hair and looks she can portray a character extremely convincingly when she puts her mind to it - and it is certainly proved here as well as some of her previous efforts like extremities and small sacrificies - a great performance from the legendary charlies angelsilk hope is the type of film that never shies away from its cheap and cheerful tv image and you know there was a limit to the budget but its not the worst film ever made the positive aspects are there; you just have to find them<SEP>0
this movie which starts out with a interesting opening of two hot blondes getting it on in the back of a driver-less moving vehicle has quite the quirky little personality to boot the cast of seven although one girl doesnt hang around for the bodycount which is unfortunate because the death toll is already so small as is are all super-hot as our story centers around teens partying way out in the desert an odd but effective choice of setting who are hunted down by a creepy man in black gloves and jeans who drives a black truck it predates many of the vehicle-inspired slashers to date the trip joy ride jeepers creepers where the killers vehicle itself becomes an evil antagonist the killer himself is quite creepy and we find solace in the extremely likable heroine in jennifer mcallister look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer in all black while our benevolent heroine sports all white attire as scanty and stonewashed as it may be director bill crain does some really great things with his camera some neat tricks on screen and the cast tries their absolute best theres enough gore in the low bodycount to please the gore fans and enough t&a from a couple of the girls to please t&a fans overall this flick is highly underrated and widely sought out in the slasher movie world as its proved quite rare to find on video highly recommended<SEP>1
when you read the summary of this film you might come to think that this is something of an odd film and in some ways it is for the primary character of this film gerard reve jeroen krabbé is haunted by visions and hallucinations the visions gerard see are all more or less subtle hints to what will happen to him as the story continues and it is great fun for the viewer to try and figure out the symbolism used in the film despite the use of symbolism and a couple of hints to the ending of the film the film maintains a very high level of excitement throughout and does not get boring for one minute this is mostly due to the great performances of jeroen krabbé and renée soutendijk christine and the great direction of the whole by paul verhoeven his directing style is clearly visible and one can say looking at it from different angles that de vierde man is a typical verhoeven film it will not only seem typical for people familiar with his american films because of the nudity and the graphic violent scenes but it will also seem typical for people familiar with his dutch films because of the same things and his talent to tell a great story when people watch verhoevens american films short sighted people might say he has no talent in telling a good story and only focuses on blood and sex that is what some people think whereas i think that he is a very talented director who tries to convey a deeper message in each with each film although not a good film hollow man his last american film is an example that verhoeven can do more than science fiction splatter movies and maybe companies should trust him more and offer him more various films to helm he needs that just watch his dutch films not only do they show that he needs a certain amount of freedom but they also show that he has remarkable talent de vierde man brought him one step closer to hollywood and is certainly one of his best8 out of 10<SEP>1
i think this movie got a low rating because it got judged by its worst moments there is a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nut-scratching scene but apart from that there are actually quite a few moments that made me laugh out loud jason lee is performing some wonderfully subtle comedy in this movie and julia stiles manages to be pretty damn funny herself apart from that this movie behaves like most romantic comedies after about 40 minutes into it you know how it is going to end which is better than most of them where you already know after +- 5 minutes anyway better movies to watch but definitely not the worst pickcheers<SEP>1
nobody truly understands the logic behind the numbering of italian zombie-flicks but  honestly  why would we bother every single film in the zombi-series delivers great fun nasty gore and gratuitous shocks and zombi 3 is no exception to this despite all the production difficulties that occurred whilst shooting this film began as an interesting lucio fulci project who had to elaborate further on his zombi 2 success but it ended up being a typical bruno mattei product with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films the screenplay is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity every ingenious idea from george a romeros night of the living dead and the crazies is shamelessly repeated here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at yet all this didnt upset me for one moment because the sublime over-the-top gore compensates for everything! on a secret army base at the phillipines scientists completed the bacterial warfare virus death one and prepare it for transport after a failing attempt to steal the virus the infected corpse of a terrorist is cremated and the zombie-ashes contaminate the entire population of a nearby tourist village the last group of survivors has to battle hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies as well as soldiers in white overalls that received instructions to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area this movie is comparable to umberto lenzis nightmare city truly badbut incredibly entertaining with fast-paced action sequences and several very creative zombie-madness situations the undead birds were original for example and the whole zombie birth sequence at the deserted hospital was pretty cool as well the infamous flying head scene is not nearly as awful as its made up to be and it belongs perfectly in this cheesy and thoroughly pleasant italian zombie flick recommended to the fans; dont mind the negative reviews<SEP>1
hey now yours truly theatrex found this while grubbing through videos at the flea market in almost new condition and in reading the back of the box saw that it was somewhat of a cult hit so of course it came home with me what a strange film the aunt and cousin of former first lady jacqueline bouvier kennedy onassis live in this decaying 28 room house out on long island suffolk co and share the house with raccoons cats fleas eyow! and who knows what else suffolk co was all over them at one point for living in filth and old jackie herself came by to set things right anyway this is one strange pair big edie and little edieedie the daughter always wears something over her head and dances sings and gives little asides to the camera that rarely make much sense big edie the mother age 79 apparently likes to run around naked and while we do get hints of what that might look like thankfully this was tastefully done to the point where were mercifully spared from that these women talk and talk and talk mostly about the past and it doesnt make a whole lot of sense except to them they live in absolute filth cats doing their business wherever look that cats going to the bathroom behind my portrait! and one bedroom appears to be their center of operations if i close my eyes and listen to big edies voice it reminds me very much of my own late aunt who was from that area of the country and had that lawn guyland accent one scene has little edie putting on flea repellent lovely you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested the box refers to these two women as eccentric and id have to say in this case it is just a euphemism for wacked out of their gourds but this film is not without its moments where you truly feel something for them this is equal parts creepy sad and disgusting but i couldnt stop watching once i started this is not my normal type of flick but i found it to be somewhat fascinating it wont be for everybody though guaranteed<SEP>1
bloodsuckers has the potential to be a somewhat decent movie the concept of military types tracking down and battling vampires in space is one with some potential in the cheesier realm of things even the idea of the universe being full of various different breeds of vampire all with different attributes many of which the characters have yet to find out about is kind of cool as well as to how most of the life in the galaxy outside of earth is vampire im not sure how the makers meant for that to work given the nature of vampires who the hell they are meant to be feeding on if almost everyone is a vampire i dont know as it is the movie comes across a low budget mix of fireflyserenity and vampires movies with a dash of aliensthe action parts of the movie are pretty average and derivative particularly of serenity but passable- they are reasonably well executed and there is enough gore for a vampire flick including some of the comical blood-spurting variety there is a lot of character stuff most of which is tedious coming from conflicts between characters who mostly seem like whiny immature arseholes- primarily cowboy dude and asian woman there are a few character scenes that actually kind of work and the actors dont play it too badly but it mostly slows things down a nice try at fleshing the characters out but people dont watch a movie called bloodsuckers for character development and drama the acting is actually okay michael ironside hams it up and is as fun to watch as ever and at least of a couple of the women are hot the space sfx arent too bad for what is clearly a low budget work the story is again pretty average and derivative but as i said the world created has a little bit of potential the way things are set up bloodsuckers really does seem like the pilot for a tv series- character dynamics introduced the world introduced but not explored etc the film does have a some highlights and head scratching moments- the kind of stuff that actually makes these dodgy productions watchable -the scene where our heroes interrogate a talking sock puppet chestburster type creature hilarious - the sex scene wtf indeed -the credit and michael ironside as muco the most annoying aspect of it all though is the really awful and usually inappropriate pop music they have playing very loud over half the scenes of the movie it is painful to listen to and only detracts from what is only average at bestbasically an okay watch is youre up for something cheesy even if it is just for the chestburster scene<SEP>0

first of all i am a butch straight white male but even with that handicap i love this movie its about real people a real time and place and of course new york city in the 80s i had many gay friends growing up in new york in the eighties and the one thing about them i always admired was their courage to live their lives the way they wanted to live them no matter what the consequences thats courageous you have to admire that this is a great film watch it and take in what it was like to be a flamboyant african american or hispanic gay man in the new york of the eighties its real life bottom line its real life<SEP>1
after i watched the films i thought why the heck was this film such a high success in the korean box office even thought the movie had a cleverunusal scenario the acting wasnt that good and the characters werent very interesting for a korean movie i liked the fighting scenes if you want to watch a film without thinking this is the film for you but i got to admit the film was kind of childish 610<SEP>1
this movie was a brilliant concept it was original cleverly written and of high appeal to those of us who arent really conformist movie pickers dont get me wrong - there are some great movies that have wide appeal but when you move into watching a movie based on everyone else is watching it - you know youre either a tween or dont really have an opinion this had a lovely subtle humor - despite most people probably looking only at the obvious the actors portrayed their characters with aplomb and i thought there was a lot more personal personality in this film has appeal for kids as well as adults esp nice to find a good movie thats not filled with sexual references and drug innuendos! a great film not to be overlooked based on public consumption this one is a must buy<SEP>1
that this poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was heralded at sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these daysfirst of all there is such a thing as the art of cinematography just picking up a 16mm camera and pointing it at whomever has a line does not make for a real moviei guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director didnt pick up someones camcordersecond indie films are supposed to be about real people theres nothing real in this film none of the characters come across as being even remotely humanwhat they come across as being is figments of the imagination of a writer trying to impress his buddies by showing them how cool and edgy he issorry but this is not good writing or good directingwhat is left is a husk of a bad movie that somehow made its way to sundance hard to believe this was one of the best films submittedin any case it made me loose what was left of my respect for the sundance brand<SEP>0
this will be brief let me first state that im agnostic and not exactly crazy about xtians especially xtian fanatics however this documentary had a tone of the like of some teenager angry at his xtian mother for not letting him play video games i just couldnt take it seriously mentioning how charlesmanson thought he was christ to illustrate the point that xtianity can breed evil i dont know it was just cheap and childish -- made the opposition look ignorant furthermore the narrator just seemed snobby and pretentious the delivery was complete overkill i cant take this documentary seriously might appeal to an angry teenager piss3d off at his xtian mother for not letting him play video games<SEP>0

this adaptation like 1949s *the heiress* is based on the henry james novel *the heiress* starring olivia de havilland remains as a well-respected piece of work though less true to james original story than this new remake which retains james original title it is the story of a awkward yet loving daughter leigh devoted to her father finney after her mother dies during childbirth the arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever and considers her as well as all women simpleminded when a young man chaplin of good family and little fortune comes courting the father is naturally suspicious but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him leigh is a controversial actress  most either love her or hate her  and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style like shes acting through gritted teeth shes not bad in this and she handles her role relatively deftly  its just an awkward role for any actress making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses while the character garners a lot of sympathy shes not particularly likable the very handsome and immensely appealing ben chaplin previously seen in *the truth about cats and dogs* plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune or is really in love with her maggie smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the well-meaning aunt finney is marvelous of course as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves but does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune this is only one instance where *washington square* differs from *the heiress* another instance is the ability to stick with it it is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping faucet offering too little story in too long of a movie<SEP>0
so much is wrong with this abysmal little wet fart of a movie that its hard to know where to beginfirst of all its a remarkably un-scary scary movie even by amercian standards the dialogue is cliché the characters are two-dimensional the writing is ho-hum and what little story there is is neither coherent nor remotely interestingwe meet the following stereotypes in order: balding loser guy probably divorced but who knows this movie doesnt tell us with a brave heart the young hero who doesnt do anything heroic at all brave little kid with a homicidal streak a mile wide and black bad-ass bitch with more brawn than brains these guys take up an ongoing fight with the tall scary reaper man and his evil ewoksoh and the film is full of wicked little metal orbs whoosing around menacing people given a chance they perform impromptu brain surgery on those who doent have the mental acuity to duck when they come at them booh! actually one of them is haunted by a good ghost but then again it might be a deceitful spectre who seems intent on helping our brave contagonists retrieve their young kidnapped friendthere is no character background or even an introduction to any of the characters it starts with some kind of recap of the ending of the previous movie but this doesnt explain a lot if youve seen the first two movies fine otherwise you dont know who these people are how they are related why they arent in school or at work or why you should care whether they live or die consequently you dont the only point of interest becomes any splatter effects and there arent enough of those to keep you awakeof potenial interestamusement are the three raider punks as stupid as they are evil who menace our heroes but they dont get much screen time they are offed almost immediately then they are buried why anybody should take the time is beyond me then they appear again as evil raider punk zombies only to be offed again literally within a minutethe rest of the movie mainly seems to consist of caspar the friendly ghost appearing and disappearing driving around looking for places and balding loser trying to score som bad black bitch booty using pickup lines that would embarrass a mentally retarded teenager no dice there; not even some gratuitous sex could have saved this movie so good thing there never is anythe head baddie called the tall man doesnt manage to scare anyone older than 3 years; howling booooy! every five minutes isnt enough why he with his amazing telekinetic powers and uncanny upper-body strength doesnt simply squash our heroes like bugs isnt explained instead he delegates the job to his inept retarded little minions who never manage to kill anyone before being shot to hellfilmgoers who like masterpieces like friday 13th part xxxxviii: jason goes to college might find some entertainment the rest of us who have developed pubic hair will be bored out of our skulls<SEP>0
yet another son who wont grow up flick and just the other recent like entries heder in another bad wig channeling napoleon for what the third time anna faris is forgettable as always; jeff daniels phoned this one in from another state at least; and diane keatonhow does one become typecast this late in a career do not bother nothing is said here that hasnt been covered many times over i will say this; its about a hundred times better than failure to launch there are very few amusing bits in the movie unless you think eli wallach cursing is funny ha ha! hes old and he dropped the f-bomb! tee hee hee pitiful!<SEP>0
the major fault in this film is that it is impossible to believe any of these people would ever be cast in a professional production of macbeth hearing david lansburys soft voice struggling laboriously with the famous tomorrow tomorrow and tomorrow speech made it impossible to believe anyone would ever consider him for the role i kept believing therefore that he didnt get the part because he was a lousy actor; not because a bigger name was available then when we see portions of the play in rehearsal it is difficult to believe the director is not parodying things with a hopelessly miscast misdirected travesty of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand the verse and directors who see the play through their own screwball interpretations sometimes directors are so anxious to have their films done and writers think they have the ability to direct their own worksthat they settle for less this appears to be such an example<SEP>0
after having seen deliverance movies like pulp fiction dont seem so extreme maybe by todays blood and bullets standards it doesnt seem so edgy but if you think that this was 1972 and that the movie has a truly sinister core then it makes you think differentlywhen i started watching this movie nothing really seemed unusual until i got to the dueling banjos scene in that scene the brutality and edge of this film is truly visible as i watched drewronny coxrobocopgo head to head with a seemingly retarted young boy it really shows how edgy this movies can get when you think that the kid has a small banjo which he could of probably made by hand compared to drews nice expensive guitar you really figure out just how out of their territory the four men areas the plot goes its very believable and never stretches past its limits but what really distinguishes this film about four business men who get more than they bargained for on a canoe trip is that director john boormanexcalibur breaks all the characters away from plain caricatures or stereotypes so as the movie goes into full horror and suspense i really cared about all four men and what would happen to themthe acting is universally excellent with jon voightmidnight cowboy enemy of the state and burt reynoldsboogie nights striptease leading the great cast jon voight does probably the hardest thing of all in this film and that is making his transformation from family man to warrior very believable unlike reynolds whose character is a warrior from the start voights character transforms over the course of the movie ned beattylife is also good in an extremely hard role come on getting raped by a hillbilly while ronny cox turns in a believable performanceone thing that really made this movies powerful for me is that the villains were as terrifying as any i had ever seen bill mckinney and herbert cowboy coward were excellent and extremely frightening as the hillbillysoverall deliverance was excellent and i suggest it to anyone except for people with weak stomachs and kids 1010 see this movie<SEP>1
world at war is perhaps the greatest documentary series of all time the historical research is virtually flawless even after a quarter century it is the most accurate and definitive documentary about ww2 an invaluable historical work that includes interviews with some of the most important and fascinating figures from the war i highly recommend it as a learning experience<SEP>1
you have to understand when wargames was released in 1983 it created a generation of wannabe computer hackers the idea that a teenager could do anything of far reaching proportions let alone deter a world war was novel and thrilling real computers were beginning to show up in peoples homes and for the first time society was becoming interconnected in a way that made the movies premise excitingly prescient granted a talking computer that balanced its free time between chess and global thermonuclear war was a bit far fetched but the brilliant commentary on nuclear proliferation and the cold war made up for it ive probably even heard of the hackers that this movie was actually based onfast forward 25 years and we have a horrible mutant of a thing that i loathe to call a sequel called wargames: the dead code ill just dig right in first of all the plot hinges on a government operated gambling site where folks who win the games automatically become terror suspects youre probably very confused right now the idea is that eventually the terrorist will click on the sub-game within the web site called the dead code where they pilot a plane over a city spraying it with bioweapons at some point in the game you have to choose between sarin gas and anthrax and if you choose sarin then youre automatically confirmed as a bioterrorism weapons expert and your family is taken into custody and interrogated in the movie this actually happens however since the payment for the game was made from a bank account that was suspicious it obviously all makes sensesecond the avatar of the ai in this straight-to-dvd bomb is an annoying flash animation that keeps repeating the pop-up-ad-esquire sound bite play with me baby because apparently in the future advanced ai loses interest in intellectual pursuits like chess and gets into pornthird the motivation for these hackers is profit and women as opposed to pure curiosity as in the original movie for some reason recent hacker movies feel the need to portray all young adults as average surfer dude kind of people who are just like everyone else that may work for your average sitcom but cmon you dont learn how to take over government computers by doing your hair playing sports and shopping at the mall folks the one novel thing i noticed was that at some point in the dialogue there is a reference to a matt damon movie and then later there is the phrase good hunting will i swear they named the main character will just for that phrase so they could send a high five to mr damon this will kid isnt bad but he was certainly wasnt like any obsessive hacker ive ever met i cant fully state how annoyed i am that this movie shares the same name as the original because it has absolutely nothing in common with it except professor falken and joshua wopr make a reappearance in this movie as a limp old man who apparently is dying of boredom and a dilapidated old tic-tac-toe machine with a higher pitched voice after some prodding joshua the ai has what appears to be sex with the new ai with the porn voice a bunch of board games flash on the big screens and the whole the only way to win is not to play revelation is supposed to be the crowning moment except that those of us who saw the original you know those who would want to see this in the first place have already been there and done that a recycled ending for a movie made from last months compostthe new movie was directed by a guy whos done 90210 and written by guys who do b movies the original was directed by a guy whos been keeping himself busy with heroes so you see the quality difference there there was talk of a real remake but i hope they dont destroy this classic all over again i swear if i have to ill visit every gambling web site until i find the one thats run by a psychotic government computer the saving grace is that i was able to stream this on netflix so at least the only energy i expended watching this disaster was for breathing clicking and indigestion<SEP>0
im so confused ive been a huge seagal fan for 25 years ive seen all of his films and many of those dozens of times i can only describe this film as bizarre steven seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film but i have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines with a thin whiny imposters voice no less what i also dont get is if they had to dub some of his lines why does his own voice appear on the rest of them i expect seagal to age like the rest of us but the seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger confidence bravado charm and sex-appeal he so easily showed us in all of his previous movies what i found myself missing most of all was his cocky self-assured attitude and his bad-ass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin where is that in-your-face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star i hope that this film is not an indication of what seagal has left to offer us - if so his lifelong fans will have to concede that the seagal we all knew and loved is gone<SEP>0
this is a short crudely animated series by david lynch as it says in the beginning and it follows the misadventures of a backwoods overall-wearing large man with a wife who has a stress disorder and an annoying son both of those elements are harped upon repeatedly in the short episodes and theres no real plot to be seen its easier if you think of this as an exceptionally odd slightly macabre looney tunes- with far more gore profanity bloody violence and occasional moments of hilarityi bought the dvd along with eraserhead having previously seen eraserhead dont look to this series if you want an artistic masterpiece- this is anything but in fact it seems to almost be a statement against such things as its rough style spits in the face of any sort of animation convention you may see as lynch says if this is funny it is only funny because we see the absurdity of it all<SEP>1
the snobs and pseudo experts consider it a far cry from de sicas best the ones suffering from a serious lack of innocence will find a problem connecting to this masterpiece de sica spoke in a very direct way his italianness doesnt have the convoluted self examination of modern italian filmmakers or the bitter self parody of pietro germi the pungent bittersweetness of mario monicelli the solemnity of visconti or the cold observation of antonioni de sica told us the stories like a father sitting at the edge of his childrens bed before they went to sleep there is no attempt to intellectualize miracolo a milano and in a lesser degree il giudizio universale are realistic fairy tales or what today we call magic realism the film is a gem from beginning to end and toto is the sort of character that you accept with an open heart but that naturally requires for you to have a heart cinema in its purest form magnificent<SEP>1
eddie murphy delirious is by far the funniest thing you will ever see in your life you can compare it to any movie and i garuntee you will decide that delirious is the funniest movie ever! this movie is about 1hr 45 mins and throughout that time there was barely a moment where i wasnt laughing you will laugh for hours after it is over replaying the punch lines over and over and over in your head eddie murphy has given so many funny performances over his career 48 hrstrading placesbeverly hills coprawcoming to america the nutty professorshreketcbut this is by far his most hilarious moment i have seen this movie so many times and it is funnier every time it never loses its edge from this day forward every great stand up performance will be emulated from delirious ***** and two thumbs up!<SEP>1
this anime was underrated and still is hardly the dorky kids movie as noted i still come back to this 10 years after i first saw it one of the better movies releasedthe animation while not perfect is good camera tricks give it a 3d feel and the story is still as good today even after i grew up and saw ground-breakers like neon genesis evangelion and rahxephon it has nowhere near the depth obviously but try to see it from a lighthearted view its a story to entertain not to questionstill one of my favourites i come back too when i feel like a giggle on over more lighthearted animes not to say its a childish movies there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humour to see it all<SEP>1
this is a film i decided to go and see because im a huge fan of adult animation i quite often find that when a film doesnt evolve around a famous actor or actress but rather a story or style it allows the film to be viewed as a piece of art rather than a showcase of the actors ability to differ his stylesthis film is certainly more about style than story while i found the story interesting a thriller that borrows story and atmosphere from films such as blade runner and many anime films it was a bit hard to follow at times and didnt feel like it all came together as well as it could have it definitely had a mixed sense of french animation and japanese anime coming together whether thats a good thing or not is up to the viewer visually this film is a treat for the eyes and in that sense a work of artif you like adult animation or would like to see a film that is different from most films out at the moment i would recommend it all i can say is that i enjoyed the experience of the film but did come away slightly disappointed because it could have been better<SEP>1
how you could say that peaches with its complex narrative dealing with a multitude of issues is a small tv idea is beyond me besides i can think of many films that have a small tv idea in their plots your obvious dislike of the tv industry sue smith has failed to rise above her television background is confusing particularly as you are having such a great time working in tv if only we could all be so talented as ms smith no i am not a friend or relative - afi award winning brides of christ road from coorainetc all made for tv come to think of it what about those other small tv ideas like against the wind bodyline the dismissal scales of justice blue murder water under the bridge etc i think peaches is a good entertaining film which had me interested and most of my friends as well from start to finish it is far from flawless yet i think it is among the best australian films i have seen over the last couple of years who knows with a few more viewings theres so much to think about it might just be up there with classics like the year my voice broke the devils playground i really did enjoy this film much more than somersault and three dollars these films i think had their moments-surreal atmospheric realistic and dealing with important contemporary issues but as for sheer entertainment for mrand mrs average movie goer and me it was very ordinary if not boring when i go to a movie i am always conscious of the audiences reaction to a film through in- cinemas reactions and overheard conversations in the foyer and loo some came out of peaches shaking their heads some with negative criticisms but many seemed to have enjoyed the experience<SEP>1
ill be honest this is one of the worst movies ever if not then its very close ever seen a bad teen soap opera well this is like one of those except worse for example: possibly spoiler girl: i wanna go somewhere elseguy: all we need is heregirl: but i wanna take myself somewhere differentguy: ill take you somewhere else proceeding this line they have sex the music is bad pop and bad punk rock if youve ever read the book avoid this movie like the plague they completely change the personalities of the characters and the events additionally they just get rid of things also the movie ends about before the book finishes it is an awful movie so if you havent read the book dont watch it if you have read the book burn it the movie if you like stupid teen soap operas that are lower quality than your average low quality teen soap opera go for it then again should we expect anything different from mtv<SEP>0
i tried to sit through this bomb not too long agowhat a disaster the acting was atrociousthere were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a lead balloonthis was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors just didnt ring truesupposedly a modern reworking of the hitchcock original lifeboati think hictcock would be spinning circles in his grave at the very thought of itfrom what i was able to suffer throughthere is nothing compelling in this movieit boasts a few semi big namesbut they put no effort into their charactersbutyou knowto be fairit was nobodys fault reallyi meanim pretty sure the script blew up in the first explosion lolit is possible that this thing ends up improving as it goes alongbut for meim not willing to spend at least three days to find outso unless you have at least a three day weekend on the horizonavoid this stinker 110<SEP>0
i saw this movie in the first couple of weeks it was out i dont remember exactly when i thought that it was alright for a ben stiller movie this movie isnt for a person without a good sense of humor like most of ben stillers jokes you have to think about them or like i said you have a good sense of humor from a couple of people on this website i saw that people didnt have anything good to say about it and it didnt get a very good rating but i would have given it a larger one this movie i thought was very good and it should have gotten a better rating maybe this isnt a movie for you im just giving you another persons opinion<SEP>1
this 1974 naschy outing is directed by leon klimovsky and a cursory glance at the publicity photos and packaging might lead you to believe that this medieval romp lies somewhere between inquisition and sadomania sadly notthis is a strictly pg affair with tame torture sequences no nudity and little edge at all naschy of whom i am a fan struts his stuff as gilles de lancre antiguo mariscal de la nacion sadly he is more pantomime villain than anything else one gets the feeling with this film that we have seen him and it done all before strictly therefore for naschy completest only<SEP>0
i knew about this as a similar programme as jackass and i saw one or two episodes on freeview and it is the same only more extreme basically three welsh guys and one mad british bloke were brought together by love of skateboarding and a complete disregardmasochistic pleasure to harm themselves and their health and safety they have had puking eating pubes-covered pizza jumping in stinging nettles naked paint balling jokes on the smaller guy while heavily sleepingsnoring stunts in a work place eg army cowboys and many more insane stunts that cause bruises bumps blood and vomit maybe not just for themselves starring matthew pritchard who does pretty much anything lee dainton also up for just about anything dan joyce the british one who hardly does much physical stuff and has a ott laugh and pancho mike locke who does a lot but is more popular for being short fat and lazy it was number something on the 100 greatest funny moments very good!<SEP>1
cmon people you cant be serious another case of advertising snuff when it totally isnt! this isnt even remotely scary nor is it terrifying or depraved - it is just utterly terrible amateurish videowork made for the next party to get the girls laidthe gore is incredibly bad even the eye-scene is far from making me want to puke but just making me want to take the camera and hit those guys over the head the girl is just laying there rubber-faced not moving at all it would have been funnier to use a real doll insteadone season of im a celebrity get me out of here! is more frightening than this one dont waste your time or your money<SEP>0
baby face is a fast paced wise cracking knowing smirk of a film thatlasts only an hour and 15 minutes but oh what a smart 75 minutes theyare! that a story that covers so much ground could be told in such ashort time puts most of todays movie makers to shame screenwriters oftoday should study the economy of baby face and cut the bloat thatoverwhelms so many of their films the story is no nonsense an amoral woman rises to wealth first underand then over the bodies of the men who fall madly in love with hersure the production code loused it up with a redeeming happy endingbut it isnt hard to see in which the direction the writers wanted togo so enjoy whats there and use your imagination for the rest stanwyck is terrific as is george brent and douglass dumbvrille as ahapless suitor not a great film but certainly an enjoyable one ifyouve never seen baby face catch it the next time its shown on cableor rent the cassette its worth the effort<SEP>1
i just cant agree with the above comment - theres lots of interesting and indeed amazing filmic imagery in this one it has an unusual structure and moves well toward a frightening climactic sequence that is notable for its effective use of silence whats more it explores the odd impulse of suicide in a very frank way not pulling any punches in what it shows yet not dwelling and over-sensationalising the subject matter it has hints of documentary about it as well as horror and art-house cinema and deserves a place amongst the canon of different horror films like the blair witch project and the original ring both of which it predates and could well be an unacknowledged influence on its definitely worth seeing if youre interested in the edges of horror cinema<SEP>1
watching the tenants has been a interesting experience for me it is the first film i have ever seen where i have shuttled at speed through parts of the nonaction - and i can normally watch anything from turgid action movies to serbo-croat indie and find them fascinatingthe tenants is frustratingly sluggish and over-orchestrated one of the main problems of the script is there is little realistic character dialogue apart from the set pieces where characters collide in a very structured setting to make this work the film needed to feel more conceptual which it didnt this leads to a lack of realistic character development; everyone seems two-dimensionalthe worse for this is the character of bill spear aka snoop dogg i found his characterization very uncomfortable and very unsympathetic at one point i even stopped the film because i got so annoyed by the characters aggressive violent and monotonal delivery the lack of any other personality layer apart from that of the reactionary on switch which gets really predictable after a while and i so desperately wanted him to have some redeeming qualities however one reason for this jar might be the nebulous time scape of the film supposedly 70s it feels and looks more early noughties if it had been more securely fixed in the 70s his character might have seemed more understandablethe lighting of the film was also awkward all the way through the soundtrack attempts to provide a certain gritty jazz-infused atmosphere that just did not come off largely because the set was too well-litthe tenants to me is an unbelievable film it doesnt depict real people or propose any interesting ways of thinking about race identity or the life of a writer be they white or blackstrangely i came away with the feeling that this project needed david lynch; his eerie clastrophobic and obsessive look and feel would have lifted both the actors and the script into something quite remarkable<SEP>0
im not sure how i missed this one when it first came out but i am glad to have finally seen itthis movie takes place in and around the 19th century red light district of okabasho japan it tells the tale of prostitution caste systems and women who are strong in a society based upon the strength of the samurai code of japanit is uniquely akira kurosawa! even though he died before he could direct this movie his adaptation of the screenplay shows his view of the japanese world and caste system is renowned and sheds light upon how these systems interact with each other the characters may revolve around each other but the caste system stays intact when each character goes back to the world they belong in the samurai warrior who drifts into the good hearted and loving prostitutes world goes back to his life while she embarks on a another road with a man who is part of her caste systemlowest of the low many prize the world of the samurai above all others but yet it is the lower caste inhabitants who can support each other and who can love without restraint the samurai in this movie turns out to be the weak one while the classless lovers prove to be the honorable ones the movie deserves a higher rating it is a tale of survival of women in feudal japan during this time frame men were thought to be the survivorsthe strong ones while women were thought to be just mindless and weak property this movie highlights the strength of japanese women and how they did what they had to for survival and how their strength enabled the japanese culture to continue on as it hasi recommend the sea is watching to anyone who is a fan of akira kurosawa and even if theyre not a fan it is a lovely quiet and soul sustaining movie and one to be treasured for any movie collection<SEP>1

this is like crouching tiger hidden dragon in a more surreal fantasy setting with incredible special effects and computer generated imagery that would put industrial light and magic to shame the plot may be hard to follow but that is the nature of translating chinese folklore to the screen; certainly the overall story would probably be more familiar to its native audience however an intelligent person should be able to keep up; moreover the martial arts scenes potency are amplified by eye popping cgi<SEP>1
the original is a relaxing watch with some truly memorable animated sequences unfortunately the sequel while not the worst of the dtv sequels completely lacks the sparklethe biggest letdown is a lack of a story like belles magical world the characters are told through a series of vignettes magical world while marginally better still manages to make a mess of the story in between the vignettes we see the mice at work and i personally think the antics of jaq and gus are the redeeming merits of this moviethe first vignette is the best about cinderella getting used to being to being a princess this is the best because the mice were at their funniest here the worst of the vignettes when jaq turns into a human is cute at times but has a lack of imagination the last vignette when anastasia falls in love was also cute the problem was i couldnt imagine anastasia being friendly with cinderella as i considered her the meaner out of the stepsisters this was also marred by a rather ridiculous subplot about lucifer falling in love with pompomthe incidental music was very pleasant to listen to;however i hated the songs they were really uninspired and nothing like the beautiful tchaikovsky inspired melodies of the originalthe characters were the strongest development here cinderella while still caring had lost her sincerity and a lot of her charm from the original though she does wear some very pretty clothes the duke had some truly funny moments but they werent enough to save the film likewise with prudence and the king as i mentioned the mice were the redeeming merits of the movie as they alone contributed to the films cuteness i have to say also the animation is colourful and above average and the voice acting was surprisingly goodall in all a cute if unoriginal sequel that was marred by the songs and a lack of a story 410 for the mice the voice acting the animation and some pretty dresses bethany cox<SEP>0
being half-portuguese doesnt render me half-blind nor half-prejudiced when discussing portuguese films not that i get to do that very often anyway but this film was such a rush of adrenaline! yes thats right - it was mostly accurate as far as history wentgoes - but it pulled no punches on venturing beyond usual portuguese-film territory: things like using real locations in the middle of traffic-congested lisbon and recruiting a real crowd to stand in for the real crowd of almost 30 years ago and by god did they get it right! ok to sum it up: very emotional if youve lived through it but youll spot minor improvements that could have been made as well as plot necessities that were if youre just watching it randomly youre in for a good historical romp only of the very recent history kind and a bit more thought-proving than usual even by european standards yes<SEP>1
i was so disappointed in this movie i dont know much about the true story so i was eager to see it play out on film and educate myself about a little slice of history with such a powerful true story and great actors it seemed like a surefire combination well somewhere the screenplay failed them it was so scattered - is this movie about his childhood his love life his own disability his speaking ability his passion for the disabled im sure there is a way to incorporate all of those things into a good story but this movie wasnt it i was left cold watching characters that were unlikable not because of their disabilities but because of their personalities other small gripes: 1 the heavy-handed soundtrack its the seventies - we get it already! 2 if hes such a phenomenal public speaker why werent we treated to more than a snippet here and there - and even then mostly in montages<SEP>0
i caught this movie on ifc and i enjoyed it although i felt like the editing job was a little rough though it may have been deliberate i had a little bit of a hard time figuring out what was going on at first because they seemed to be going for a little bit of a pulp fiction-style non-linear plot presentation it seemed a little forced though i certainly think that the movie is worth watching but i think it could have used a little cleaning up some scenes just dont seem to make sense after others im surprised to see the rating here as low as it is its not outstanding but it doesnt have any really serious problems i gave it a 710 the movie did show at least that laurence fishburne can act when he wants to they must have just told him not to in the matrix movies<SEP>1
it does not seem that this movie managed to please a lot of people first off not many seem to have seen it in the first place i just bumped into it by accident and then judging by the reviews and the rating of those that did many did not enjoy it very muchwell i did i usually tolerate gere for his looks and his charm and even though i did not consider him a great actor i know he can do crazy pretty well i liked his mr jones but this performance is all different he is not pretty in this one and he is not charming his character is completely different from anything i had seen from him up to that point---old ugly broken determined and gere in what to me is so far his best performance ever pulls it off beautifully i guess it is a sign of how well an actor does his job if you cannot imagine anyone else doing it instead---think hopkins as hannibal lecter or washington as alonzo in training day that is how good gere was herethe rest of the cast were fine by me too i guess i would not have cast danes in this role mostly because i think she is too good-looking for it but she actually does an excellent job holding her own with a gere in top form which is no small feat strickland easily delivers the best supporting act in a part that requires a considerable range from her i actually think she owns the key scene with gere and danes and that is quite an achievementso what about the rest of the movie apart from some excellent acting the story is perhaps not hugely surprising some 8mm-ish aspects to it but adding the veteran breaks in rookie storyline to the who-dunnit and also like silence of the lambs adding a sense of urgency through trying to save the girl and the impending retirement of geres character all that is a backdrop to the development of the two main characters as they help each other settle into their respective new stations in life thats a lot to accomplish in a 100 minutes but it is done well and we end up caring for the characters and what happens to themdirection and photography were adequate i could have done without the modern music-video camera movements and cutting but then i am an old curmudgeon and it really wasnt all that bad in fact i think it did help with the atmosphere of the movie which as you might have guessed by and large isnt a happy oneworth seeing<SEP>1
just cause takes some of the best parts of three films cape fear a touch of evil and silence of the lambs and mixes it together to come up with a good thriller of a filmsean connery is a liberal law professor married to a former assistant district attorney kate capshaw and hes a crusader against capital punishment blair underwoods grandmother ruby dee buttonholes connery at a conference and persuades him to handle her grandsons appeal hes sitting on death row for the murder of a young girlwhen connery arrives in this rural florida county hes up against a tough sheriff played by laurence fishburne whos about as ruthless in his crime solving as orson welles was in touch of evil later on after connery gets the verdict set aside with evidence hes uncovered hes feeling pretty good about himself at that point the film takes a decided turn from touch of evil to cape fearto say that all is not what it seems is to put it mildly the cast uniformly turns in some good performances special mention must be made of ed harris who plays a hannibal lecter like serial killer on death row with underwood he will make your skin crawl and he starts making connery rethink some of those comfortable liberal premises hes been basing his convictions on many a confirmed liberal ive known has come out thinking quite differently once theyve become a crime victimof course the reverse is equally true many a law and order conservative if they ever get involved on the wrong end of the criminal justice system wants to make real sure all his rights are indeed guaranteedcriminal justice is not an end but a process and a never ending one at that for all society i guess if just cause has a moral that would probably be it<SEP>1

ok so i know of this movie because of a friend of mines in it and i actually visited the set when they were filming so from a personal stand-point i was intrigued to finally view this obscure little gem if you dig at all on info regarding this movie youll find its mired in legal troubles even over 7 years after being filmed so if you are at all like me -- then youll do whatever it takes to obtain a copy my source ebay about $15 but i felt ripped because when i got it today in the mail it was a very rough grainy copy of a screener only release complete with annoying top mini time-code but alas i could still enjoy it but not as much as if i had a proper copy something i suggest you obtain if you want the full impact this film may or may not have on you from what i have gleaned its been released on dvd in germany & now spain with that good luck & happy searchingbidding; the scoresndtrk is worth it alone very eclectic and varied somethinbg rare these days imho in film -- i think that will be my next sndtrkscore to locate but i digress now onto the review the film opens as billy zanes character is injecting a nurse in the mental ward he is apparently locked up in he steals her clothes even shoes and quickly moves into a series of holding up a bankloan shop but after escaping with the loot well i guess this is where the plot begins -- he inadvertently looses it after perpetrating several campy over-the-top crimes & dalliances to various a to c-list celebs to locate the money he finds himself somehow in a cemetery where a funeral -- i think for the dead guy he shoots in the loan officebank and -- even with 1950s police cars and cops looking all over for him steadily throughout -- he never gets seen or nabbed he sees daily newspapers reporting his crimes this i liked because it gave the thin plot an extension after all its a movie see: fiction & director iris iliopulos does what i think is everything possible to 1 bring woods vision to fruition and 2 give it an updated feel yet have shots of authentic 50s police cars intertwined with ahh local la99$ stores -- so well hence my 9 rating if the period and props were authentic -- i would have given it a 10 now it wraps it self up kinda weird and i wont spoil it for anyone but lets just say the final ending is somewhat disappointing for it to me it had promise action and comedy -- all up till the end sowith all that said --locate a copy at your own discretionjust realize that as there is no dialouge except for some narration and singing this may be up your alley -- maybe not-- but i definitely think its worth a watch the actors all do fine performances and its only the inconsistency in proper period pieces that really made me long for just that correction -- then i would say by all means check this film out for its not like anything these studios put out these days or will in the future too i am sure<SEP>1

this film although not totally bad should have been filmed where the actual events took place grand island nebraska was devastated by no less than seven tornados on the night of june 3 1980 grand island is situated in the nearly treeless flat platte river valley in hall county the makers of this movie filmed in the tree covered hills of ontario and moved the whole event to a non-existant town called blainsworth the people of grand island bravely survived this awful night only to be forgotten because of a poorly made movie<SEP>0
on stage tv or in a book the woman in black is an outstanding ghost story other reviewers have already said just about all there is to say about this film but i thought i would add my belated little review too the made-for-tv movie has a deliberately slow first act which chronicles the main character arthur as he goes about his business as a solicitor in 1920s london i can understand why this might not appeal to all palates nevertheless for me i love this british-style of storytelling similar to any of the bbcs ghost story for christmas adaptations of the great mr james work in the second act the ghost story kicks in as arthur is sent to the provinces by his boss to tidy up the affairs of a deceased client the third act relentlessly builds up to a spine-tingling conclusion as a londoner i have seen the play i own the book dvd-r and have the unabridged audio book on my ipod too what is sure for me the women in black on any medium is a ghost story with few equals it is about time that we had a legitimate region 2 dvd release<SEP>1
i managed to catch a late night double feature last night of before sunrise 1995 and before sunset 2004 and saw both films in a row without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately after sleeping it over i have to say that i largely prefer the former over the latter and i shall explain whybefore sunrise introduces us with then young actors ethan hawke reality bites dead poets society only 25 at the time of the films release; and julie delpy the three colors trilogy then 26 although looking much younger he is a promiscuous american writer touring europe after breaking up with his girlfriend; she is a young french student on her way home to paris they meet on the budapest-vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together the two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of vienna exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on lovethe film has 1990s written all over it: back then technology was leaping rapidly the new millennium with all its hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future the characters of jesse hawke and celine delpy with all their flaws and inconsistencies celines accent if by mistake or on purpose was half american-half french and it swinged from one spectrum to the other breaking the characters credibility were a mirror of the time watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement acting all clichéd and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well is what really made this movie work for me the fact that the director doesnt let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth whileall in all sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of vienna a well told classical romantic rendezvous and a film i will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future<SEP>1
a little girl lives with her father and brother in the middle of the countryside this little girl rosalie has some psychotic tendencies as the movie opens with her feeding kittens to some kind of creatures in the cemetery and she has recently lost her mother who went crazy but whilst alive enjoyed staying in the woods all night the premise of the film has a new young lady coming to rosalie to take care of her she is introduced to the evil of the woods while driving and imagine the suspense here experiences a huge blue barrel falling over the side of a cliff to somehow stop her car dead in its tracks from there she walks to the nearest house and discovers mrs whitfield who then goes into a whole lot of explanation about rosalie and her family the earnestness exuded by the mrs whitfield character has to be seen to be believed well the young lady meets up with the child and we soon learn that not only is she strange but everyone in the film is very bizarre as well they all do share one thing in common which is none of them ever heard of an acting school none of these people can act - as evidenced by the few vehicles any of them in the entire film appeared in before or since - and all of them look like they have little idea what is going on pause to remember lines and have all the conviction of a paper bag the director plods through the material in a slow pace with this horrible piano music crescendoing here and there at things that are suppose to be scary it takes us a bit before we get to a couple of murders by the creature friends but by that time i didnt care the murders are not convincing either and truth be told the whole film looks like someone through it together on their friends farm with the people and things on hand there that all being said the ending does have some creepy aspects to it though we dont learn one darn thing about why rosalie is like this or more importantly who the creature with the cheap masks are cheap doesnt even begin to describe the budget here with it basically is a couple old farmhouses and some sheds at the end and of course the woods someone lent the director a couple old cars too no special effects of any kind and only the most minimal make-up there are so many guffawsridiculous moments to list but i will just list a few here that at the very least made me chuckle from the lack of aptitude from the creative powers involved: 1watch the gardeners body well after he has been slain len comes in and sees him butchered and you can see his fat belly heave with life 2the dying scene at the end where the actress playing rosalie is killed she looks like she is listening to directions and takes her sweet time dying considering the method 3how about the guy playing roaslies father giving us a cranky poor mans andy griffith the scene where he is laughing about boy scouts dying was a weird hoot the child is indeed a very bad film and is very bad even for the standards of 70s cheese if you will this isnt a b film but more like a z film with producer harry novak making some money on virtually nothing<SEP>0
if this had been done earlier in the zatoichi series it could have been one of the best it is good enough as most of them are but the plot and the characters seem too complicated for the series at this point the situation is unusually intriguing: the farmers in the province have two champions a benevolent boss for once and a philosopher-samurai who starts a sort of grange; both run afoul of the usual local gangsters who want the crops to fail because it increases their gambling revenues and their chances to snap up some land; their chief or powerful ally is a seeming puritan who is death on drinking and gambling but secretly indulges his own perverse appetites he also resembles dracula as the villains in the later zatoichi movies tend increasingly to do these characters have enough meaning so that they deserved to be set against zatoichi as he was drawn originally but by now he has lost many of his nuances and the changes in some of the characters such as the good boss and the angry sister of a man zatoichi has killed need more time then the movie has to give so that the story seems choppy as if some scenes were missing other than that the movie shows the virtues of most of the others in the series: good acting sometimes lyrical photography the creation of a vivid believable and uniquely recognizable landscape the absence of which is obvious in the occasional episode where the director just misses it and a technical quality that of its nature disguises itself: the imaginatively varied use of limited sets so their limitations seem not to exist and of course there is the keynote actor whose presence as much as his performance makes it all work this must be one of the best-sustained series in movie history<SEP>1
well magic works in mysterious ways this movie about 4 prisoners trying to escape with the help of spells written by another prisoner centuries ago was a superb occult thriller with a surprising end and lots of suspense even if it had something of a theater-play almost everything happens in the cell it never got boring and it was acted very well in the tradition of cube you felt trapped with the characters and even if they were criminal you developed some sympathy with some of them only to change your mind by the twists the story takes some happenings catched you off guard and there was always a touch of insanity in the air altogether intense and entertaining and as i didnt expect anything a friend rented it it was a positive surprise!<SEP>1

some people say this is the best film that prc ever released im not too sure about that since i have a fond place in my heart for some of their mysteries i will say that this is probably one of the most unique films they or any other studio major or minor ever releasedthe plot is simple the ghost of a wrongly executed ferryman has returned to the swamp to kill all those who lynched him as well as all of their off spring into this mix comes the granddaughter of one ghosts victims the current ferryman she takes over the ferry business as the ghost closes in on the man she lovesshrouded in dense fog and set primarily on the single swamp set this is more musical poem than regular feature filmlisten to the rhythms of the dialog especially in the early scenes their is poetical cadence to them likewise there is a similar cadence to the camera work as it travels back and forth across the swamp as if crossing back and forth across the door way between life and death innocence and guilt the film reminds me of an opera or oratorio or musical object lesson more than a normal horror film its an amazing piece of film making that is probably unique in film historythis isnt to guild the lilly this is a low budget horrormystery that tells you a neat little story that will keep you entertained its tale of love and revenge is what matters here not the poetical film making and it holds you attention first and foremost the technical aspects just being window dressing if there is any real flaw its the cheapness of the production the fog does create a mood but it also hides the fact that this swamp is entirely on dry land the constant back and forth across it is okay for a while but even after 58 minutes you do wish that we could see something elsedont get me wrong i do like the film a great deal its a good little film that i some how wish was slightly less poverty stricken its definitely worth a look if you can come across it<SEP>1
im not a stage purist a movie could have been made of this play and it would almost necessarily require changes comme ci comme ca but the modest conceits of this material are lost or misunderstood by the movies creators who are in full-on shallow blockbuster mode it would be hard to imagine a worse director perhaps only josh logan & jack warner could have ruined this in the same way attenborough didonstage a chorus line was a triumph of workshopping as a production method dancers answering a casting call found themselves sitting around shooting the crap about their stage-career experiences very 70s! then bennett and hamlisch took some time handed them a song and cast them as themselves astonishing! unbelievably modern the storyof acl is in turn about answering a casting call for a play we never have a complete view of because the play doesnt matter it was meta before the idea was invented 25 years before adaptation noodled with a similar idea acl was also another in a reductivist trend that is still alive & which is a hallmark of modern creativity: that technique itself is compelling that theres more drama in an average persons life than you could ever synthesize with invented characters what a gracious idea the stage play had one performance area an empty stage and three different ways to alter the backdrop to alleviate visual tedium not to keep viewers distracted the space recedes and the actors stories are spotlighted it worked just fine that was the point all these ideas are trampled or bastardized set-wise there wasnt one and no costumes either until the the dancers came out for their final bows in which the exhilarating one is finally powerfully performed in full gold top hats and tails with moves we recognize because weve watched them in practice sessions the pent-up anxiety of the play is released --- and audiences went nuts after grampa manhandles this its like a mushed strangled bird he clearly has the earlier respected all that jazz and fosses stage piece dancin in mind as he makes his choices hamlischs score was edgy & interesting for its time but time has not been kind to it its as schmaltzy as jazz hands and thats before attenborough ever touches it hes remarkable at finding whatever good was left and mangling it a simple question might have helped attenborough while filming this could i bear spending even a few minutes with people like these a major issue for any adaptation of the play is how the 4th wall of theater pivotal by its absence in theater would be addressed in the film format theres never been a more frontal play the answer they came up with was im sorry what was the question the cast has been augmented from a manageable number of unique narratives to a crowd suffocating each other and the audience and blending their grating selves together i was well past my annoyance threshold when that annoying little runt swings across the stage on a rope clowning at the absent audience the play made you understand theater people this movie just makes you want to choke themperhaps broadways annoying trend of characters walking directly to stage center and singing their stories at the audience les miz miss saigon instead of relating to other characters started here but the worst imaginable revival of the play will make you feel more alive than this movie a chorus line is pure schlock<SEP>0

maybe im really getting old but this one just missed me and the old funny bone completely surely there must be something powerful wrong with this irishman thats me schultz! lordy lordy what i would give to see the light! firstly that phil silvers manic energy wit and drive was very much a part of the comedic upbringing and overall education in life if you will although it is possible that the series first titled: youll never get rich 1955-59* could have gotten on the cbs tv network with someone else in the title role of sgt bilko it is very hard to picture any other actorcomedian in the business wearing those master sergeants stripessuch a strong identification is inescapable though not the same sort of career-wrecking typecasting of a nightmare that it proved to be to some other guys like clayton morethe lone ranger george reeves the adventures of superman and charles nelson riley uncle crocs blockone major stumbling block to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the 1950s tv screen to the 1990s movie-going public is our collective memory without being sure about what percentage of the crowd remembered the bilko character from seeing the original run and early syndication revivals and their numbers were surely considerable; even a large segment of the young had seen bilko reruns in recent times it was obvious that the new film and the source were miles; or even light years apartso as not to be thought of as a totally square old grouch please lets consider some other pointsright here today the 14th day of november in the year of our lord 2007 let me swear and affirm under oath that i have been a steve martin fan for nearly 30 years furthermore ive enjoyed the wit and talents of bilko 96 co-stars dan akroyd and the late phil hartman after all it was the talents of guys like this and so many others alumni of nbc;s saturday night and second city tv that kept the last quarter of the 20th century laughing but a bilko re-make; it just didnt clickperhaps if the film had been made as a service comedy always liked em! but without the bilko show names and gave it some identity of it self it would be more highly regarded by crabby old guys like meso weve already had so many sitcom and cartoon series turned into movies lately whats next howse about somebody doing hal roachs world war ii army comedy series of sergeants doubleday & ames and tvs 1st cartoon series crusader rabbit remember where you heard it first! poodle schnitz!<SEP>0
i imagine victorian literature slowly sinking into the mire of the increasingly distant past pulled down by the weight of its under-skirts along comes television: at its best it has a redemptive power and with dramatisations like those the bbc produce so finely victorian literature gets a new stab at life the religious themes the moral overtones may be increasingly ill at ease in a world no longer easily shocked and acquainted with cohabitation affairs and domestic violence but those old well-told stories have enduring power and this is ones a hidden gemits hard to gauge today just how forceful feminist and extraordinary ann brontes masterpiece the tenant of wildfell hall actually was emerging from the primeval slime of restrictive corsets  bodily mental societal  her heroine helen huntingdon escapes a miserable marriage flees brutality and alcoholism braves not only her abusive husbands fury but societys pinched intolerance and malicious gossip to wreak change in her life she pays a price; but retains her self-respect; she falls in love along the way; she emerges battered but victorious and strong i just love watching women like these on screenthe actors are superb  the best brits have to offer the love story is beautifully handled with real passion and feeling by well-matched actors tara fitzgerald inhabits every aspect of the complicated heroine and as has been said here by other reviewers no less sharply defined and beautiful a face could survive that petrifying hairstyle toby stephens striking sparks off her contributes just the right combination of headstrong handsome youth and passionate yearning vulnerability rupert graves one of my favourite british actors ever enjoys himself as the charismatic villain so much so that youre almost with him at the end no ones perfect the supporting cast ably create a world into which you sink without feeling that coarse compromises have been made to modern tastes and without having felt preached to another bbc classic highly recommended: this is how romantic literature should be dramatised<SEP>1

kay pollack the man behind this movie is a real great man who tries to share his life philosophy in different ways he has written a bunch of good and well written books about how to control your senses and keep your soul happy the message in most of his books and this movie is about that your thoughts in fact is what causes your problems and that the reason of your anger hardly ever is caused of what you think of the main message is that you can choose to be happy but hardly ever do thatto watch this movie and learn something very important on life you have to keep your mind very open and l i s t e n to all the hidden messages or guidelines to get through life which most of the parts in this movie contains if you listen and watch watch it with your earsyou wont learn the meaning of life but youll learn how to live and get the most out of itso while watching please keep in mind:the mind is like a parachute it doesnt work unless its open!<SEP>1
bend it like beckham is a film that got very little exposure here in the united states it was probably due to the fact that the movie was strongly british in dialogue and terminology and dealt a lot with football soccer here which some may have trouble relating too in the us its unfortunate because this movie is absolutely fantastic and deserved much more coverage over here i think the basis of the storyline following a dream is something many people can relate to and in the end bend it like beckham proves to be a good-feeling film with a source of inspiration and really good acting i was not overly excited about seeing this film initially but now i regret not seeing it sooner i highly recommend this movie!<SEP>1
bugs life is a good film but to me it doesnt really compare to movies like toy story and stuff dont get me wrong i liked this movie but it wasnt as good as toy story the film has the visuals the laughs and others that toy story had but the film didnt feel quite as i dont know but i thought it was still a pretty good film a bugs life i dont want to say this is a film that i dont remember i saw it years ago of course i havent seen toy story in years but i still remember it i shouldnt have reviewed this film but i am i am giving it a thumbs up though its not exactly the best work pixar has donea bugs life:*******<SEP>1
without question the worst film ive seen for a long while i endured to the end because surely there must be something here but no the plot when not dealing in clichés rambles to the point of non-existence; dialogue that is supposed to be street is simply hackneyed; characters never develop beyond sketches; set-pieces are clichéd worse considering its co-director the photography is only so-socomments elsewhere that elevate this alongside get carter long good friday or kaspar hauser are way way off the mark; lives of the saints lacks their innovation let alone their depth and shading in short their craft a ruthless editor could probably trim it down to a decent 30-minute short but as it stands its a 6th form film project realised on a million-pound scale; rambling and bloated with its own pretensions that it received funding surely only because of rankins name while other small films struggle for cash is depressing for the british film industry<SEP>0
in brave new girl holly comes from a small town in texas sings the yellow rose of texas at a local competition and gets admitted to a prestigious arts college in philadelphia from there the movie grows into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty i loved this movie it was full of great singing and acting and characters that kept it moving at a very nice pace the acting was of course wonderful virginia madsen and lindsey haun were outstanding as well as nick roth the camera work was really done well and i was very pleased with the end it seems a sequel could be in the making kudos to the director and all others that participated on this production quite a gem in the film archives<SEP>1
as seems to be the general gist of these comments the film has some stunning animation i watched it on blu-ray but it really falls short of any real depthfirstly the characters are all pretty dull i got a hint of a kind of laputa situation between agito toola and the main antagonist shunack however maybe my mind wanderd and this was wishful thinking laputa being my favourite animé original engilsh dub the characters are not really lovable either and as mentioned in another post they fall in love exceptionally quickly leaving poor old minka jealous and rejected she loves agito who seems oblivious of this however she promptly seems to forgive toola at the end with no explanation for the change of heart other than it makes the ending a little bit more happy there is also a serious lack of explanation like who are the druids really are they people and who are the weird womengirls who seem to hang out with them and run the forest there is nothing explaining why they are there and how they can give regular humans superpowers the plants coming from the moon still does not fill in the blanks about this it is almost like a weird version of the day of the triffidsand who does call toola why bother with this if it wont be explainedi really wanted to like this film but i found the plot no where near as deep as a film like ghost in the shell or having any real character like those of miyazaki i do not resent watching it but i do sort of wish i hadnt bought it my advice give it a go if you have a couple of hours to spare but borrow it or buy it cheap! perhaps if your new to animé films and dont have much to go by you will enjoy it it certainly is visually pleasing<SEP>0
kid found as a baby in the garbage and raised at a martial arts academy has a knack for sinking baskets with the help of the man who found him he gets in to college and is promoted to the championship as he searches for his real parents infinitely better in pieces action comedy is a real mess as a whole it seems to be striving for a hipper basketball version of shaolin soccer but the comedy is scatter shot its focus wanders more than a chihuahua with add on quadruple espresso i kept asking what am i watching i watched it from start to finish and i still dont know what the hell happened its a shame since there are some great action scenes some amusing jokes and the occasional moment but nothing none of it ever comes together id take a pass<SEP>0
not a very good movie but according to the info its pretty accurate in depicting torture techniques the purpose of the film was to show the brutality of the nk pow camps and thats done effectively enough with surprising frankness for the time whatever technical flaws exist and there are plenty by watching this youll see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some pretty nasty stuff - again nasty because its being done north of the dmz and not in guantanamo bayi dont think any of the korean veterans brought up his torture when running for office and if you watch the movies like this one and pork chop hill in comparison to the vietnam films i dont know if it was the people in 54 being trapped in the wwii concepts the boys tend to wisecrack a lot or the war or what but its interesting to see this from the same system that 16 years later would be making movies like go tell the spartans<SEP>0
this movie isnt about football at all its about jesusgod!! its the same kind of sappy sanctimonious religious drivel you get from those arch idiots who wrestle for jesus or pump iron for jesus yeah jesus was totally buffed liked contact sports and definitely owned a full set of dumb bells duhhh! this movie should have been entitled hiking for jesus or something along those lines just to let the general public know that the real intent of this movie is to convert people to christianity and to pander to those whose brains have already been thoroughly washed in the blood of the lamb that the title is derived from the bible is made clear when the head coach is reading his bible and asking jesus for help the recent sports movie invincible was 100 times more inspiring than this was and jesus wasnt even a factor it was just the desire and determination of an individual with a dreamany broad appeal as an inspirational sports movie is ultimately lost amidst all of the blatant bible thumping and sanctimonious religious propaganda one gets the impression that the sole message is the only way you can succeed and make positive gain is if you accept jesus as your personal savior but this is simply not true and is therefore a lie being perpetuated by those who believe that it is true and want everyone else to believe it the image of the winning athlete thanking jesus when he wins comes directly to mind what does he do when he loses does he curse jesus of course not! when he loses jesus isnt responsible jesus is only responsible when he wins and the logic goes round and round and round and it ends up exactly where the true believer needs it to be every time!! i had to hit pause when the scene with the coach receiving a brand new truck came on so i could stop rolling on the floor laughing my ass off and catch my breath materialism is not what jesus taught i find it odd that most so called christians seem to either forget or ignore this message from their savior especially when i see a jesus fish on the back of a huge gas guzzling suv that passes me like im standing stillanother message this movie implies is that jesus apparently cares more about the win loss record of a mediocre high school football team that he does about the millions of starving children in the world the final scene where the insecure and unsure kicker boots a 51 yard field goal and it is hyped up as an unbelievably incredible miracle puts the final gag me with a spoon religious red flag on this turkey i only gave it three stars because the guy who played the black coach could actually act<SEP>0
tillman jrs drama about the first african american navy master diver gooding jr who defies all odds and achieves his goals despite a strict embittered trainer the screenplay is not bad a bit extreme at times but the direction and acting is first-rate and this film is inspiring and achieves what its supposed to do i liked deniro in the lead although its not on par with his masterful works taxi driver godfather and all the others it is as good as his other good performances such as in king of comedy or angel heart deniro is always convincing and believable here very good performance gooding jr is not bad definitely one of his better performances --- imdb rating: 66 my rating: 910<SEP>1
i had watched this film from ralph bakshi wizards hey good lookin one night ago on wwwafrovideoorg and i didnt see anything racial i am not stupid i do admit the character designs are a bit crude and unaccpectable today but i think its a satire and a veryvery urban retelling of the old uncle remus stories that the black american culture created right down to the main characters and the blatant nod to the tar baby and the briar patch these arent bigoted stories mind you but cultural icons created by black americans and me being a white woman read and love those stories and i also found it an interesting time-capsule view on the black culture in harlem new york in the 70swell to get to the nitty-gritty of this film: this film is a live-actionanimated film which begins in live-action with a fellow named sampson barry white and the preacherman charles gordone rush to help their friend randy philip michael thomas escape from prison but are stopped by a roadblock and wind up in a shootout with the police while waiting for them randy unwillingly listens to fellow escapee pappy scatman crothers as he begins to tell randy the animated story of brother rabbit a young newcomer to the big city who quickly rises from obscurity to rule over all of harlem; you know to me rabbitbear and fox are animal versions of randysampson and the preacherman an abstract juxtaposition of stylized animation and live action footage the film is a graphic and condemnatory satire of stereotypes prevalent in the 70s  racial ethnic and otherwiseso anyway it is another good bakshi movie; and should we sweep films like this under the rug pretend they never exist hmmmi think that would be a shame; i think we should watch these films entacted and learn about what goes on back then just how far we come since then<SEP>1
unfortunately one of the best efforts yet made in the area of special effects has been made completely pointless by being placed alongside a lumbering silly and equally pointless plot and an inadequate clichéd screenplay hollow man is a rather useless filmpractically everything seen here has been done to death - the characters the idea and the action sequences especially the lift shaft! - with the only genuinely intriguing element of the film being the impressive special effects however it is just the same special effect done over and over again and by the end of the film that has been done to death also i was hoping before watching hollow man that the invisible man theme which is hardly original in itself would be the basis of something newer and more interesting this is not so it isnt long before the film turns into an overly-familiar blood bath and mass of ineffectual histrionics - the mound of clichés piles up so fast that its almost impressiveon top of all this kevin bacon does a pretty useless job and his supporting cast are hardly trying their best good points might be a passable jerry goldsmith score but no competition for his better efforts a quite interesting use of thermal imagery and the special effects i was tempted to give this film three out of ten but the effects push hollow mans merit up one notch410<SEP>0
this was a very good film i didnt go into it with very high expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the acting the script and the scenery miranda richardson was fantastic and so was joan plowright they stole the show but the other actors played their parts wonderfully also very enjoyable film<SEP>1
as peckinpah did with straw dogs and kubrick with a clockwork orange director john boorman delivers an effective film about mans violent side in deliverance arguably a definitive horror film of the 1970s burt reynolds jon voight ned beatty and ronny cox portray four atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe trip down the wild cahulawassee river in northern georgia before it is dammed up into what reynolds calls one big dead lakebut the local mountain folk take a painfully obvious dim view of these city boys carousing through their woods and the following day continuing on down the river beatty and voight are accosted and sexually assaulted the films infamous squeal! sequence by two vicious mountain men bill mckinney herbert cowboy coward thus what started out as nothing more than a lark through the appalachians has now turned into a nightmare in which our four protagonists come to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we think of as barbarismjames dickey adapted the screenplay from his own best-selling book and the result is an often gripping and disturbing shocker often known for its squeal! and dueling banjos sequences deliverance is also quite a pulse-pounding ordeal with the four leading men superb in their roles and mckinney and coward making for two of the most frightening villains of all times a must-see film for those willing to take a chance<SEP>1
so neighbor was killing neighbor reminds me of iraq as i watched the american flag 50 stars in 1864 being dragged behind the horse i realized why burning that piece of red white and blue doesnt upset me as much as our destructionindifference to the bill of rights im a southerner and must have some historical memorywatching the tobey mcguire character learn to respect the dignity of a former slave as he looks at the scalps of blacks and germans his ethnic background being wagered at a poker gamewas interesting many twists in this movie the wife who is forced into her marriage shows both lust and a strong will characteristics were not used to seeing in respectable victorian southern bellesthe crazy wacked out renegade southerner gave me some insight into why my cousin head of the copeland horse-thieving gang inc in mississippi was hung about that time bands of homeless men were roaming the countryside armed remind you of iraq and how similar we are underneath the facade of religion and ethnic background and why southerners are still fighting that civil war todaytoo bad we cant use that same knowledge in our handling of the country weve just invaded and are occupying fomenting civil war everywhere thats mesopotamia now called iraq who happen to have the misfortune to sit on oil the wild-eyed killers in missouri raiding lawrence kansas could as easily be the insurgents were fighting now with no successanother anomaly was the fathers tribute to the yankees who move into lawrence and erect a school even before they erect a church and for that reason theyll win huh i was taught history in birmingham al and we were taught that the north was much more industrial and richerthats why they won course they also literally had god on their side as you see here when the freed slave indicates that hes cutting out to free his mother sold into slavery in texas god what a horrible legacy slavery gave usacting pretty good lots of blood and gore as the warriors ride gleefully into battle but didnt hear any rebel yells so reminiscent of football games in alabama you also get a real feeling for how stupid the war was as the bushwackers and jayhawkers gather their forces for another raid they have lost sight of why theyre fighting and so do we just more mindless slaughteryoure also brought up to date with the limbless kids coming home from iraq as the bushwacker ahh what connotations first has his arm seared shut trying to save it then has it amputated and then dies so much suffering for such a stupid causethe cinematography is fantastic now i have to get back to the dvd and get the production notes one of my favorite parts of any movie i suspect that this movie was written by a gore vidal as the spoken language is of a type you would associate with that era if you knew history the dialogue is definitely thought-provoking not your ordinary blood and guts war movie by any means you see the wounded but still active-duty soldiers still fighting cause they have nothing else to do you see the southern raiders living off the land stealing indiscriminately yet at the beginning youve seen the battle stop so the women could be evacuated from danger as i read the escalating number of women and children dying in iraq im thinking where did we lose our sense of honor as a people i have forgotten why i sought this movie out and bought it after 20 years but some book somewhere lauded it with good reason tobey at his best pre-spideyman buy the dvd or rent it and tell me why others laud this not just liberals cest moi<SEP>1
i saw it at cinema mk2 hautefeuille just one night after its first public projection in paris a very pretty film about three 15 years old teenagers all of them just at about the same psychologically stages many of the scenes let us to come back to our adolescence age & our first feelings about sexual relations it is possible to imagine that the director would like to reduce the first strong sensual feelings of the girls to lesbianism but even in that case she doesnt corrupt the likelihood of the story you can sometimes find the film a little slow but it is what creates this intimate atmosphere i fund the young actresses of talent special mention with floriane and marie very convincing there are many small details but this film also enabled me to discover what synchronized swimming is: impressing!<SEP>1
far by my most second favourite cartoon spielberg did after animaniacs even if the ratings were low so what i still enjoyed it and loved it was so funny and i adored the cast wow jess harnell and tress macneille were in there and were just fantastic the whole cast were brilliant especially the legendary frank welkerid love to see this cartoon again was so awesome and the jokes were brilliant also i can remember the hilarious moment where brain cameos in it you hear his voice and it played the patb theme instrumental that was just fantastic i love it in those cartoons when cameos pop in i wish this cartoon and animaniacs came back i loved them<SEP>1
i saw this film first in the soviet union and many erotic scenes were simply edited out by the censorship committee but then in poland in 2000 i watched it in a complete form and so what the plot is incredibly unwise - 2 men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of feminist strong straight and fundamentally severe ladies the men now try to fight it and then the whole bunch of extremely silly clichés follow - sex-drive constant masculine desire for sex feminists who are shown like complete idiots you may agree with them or not but idiots certainly they are not and so on the performance even of the stellar jerzy stuhr is here wooden and strangely bad - he just pulls unfunny faces and repeats on saying phrases like i am in the elevator with a nude chick and i havent done anything to her! this was intended to be a comedy instead it turned out to be a vapid farce full of predictable jokes and below-the-waist innuendos do not waste your time on it - this is just bad<SEP>0
ive bought certain films on disc even though the second rate presentation wasnt an option a certain company i wont identify here has put out several pan and scan dvds clean and sober star 80 and this one to name just three! of films i dont think anyone wants to see in this compromised format some discs give the viewer a choice of 16x9 or full screen and others are just in their theatrical release 166:1 ratiothat off my chest ill say deathtrap was a spooky and oddly enough amusing picture my only complaints are the tinny score what is that f____g instrument that is usually dragged out for films set in 18th century france and dyan cannon screaming at regular intervals couldnt her character have been an asthmatic who grabbed for an inhaler when she was stressed minor complaints both the benefits of discs include being able to fast forward to get beyond those things which you dont likei never saw a staged version of deathtrap so having these folks in the roles sets a great impression of their careers at the time before broadway tickets cost an arm and a leg the theatre was more affordable to average people now anyone paying less than a kings ransom to get live entertainment probably isnt going to a hit show on the great hyped waymichael caine and christopher reeve were both large virile specimens in the early 80s and thats integral to how well react to their profession and overall image here theyre definitely not bookish men who cant fight or will back down from an obstacle the two are equally great as their criminal stubbornness becomes their ultimate deathtrap<SEP>1
as many agree origin is a beautiful anime artistically the music graphics and the world created are gorgeous and it really stands above most other modern animated works however if you are looking for more than this than i suggest looking else where the beauty stops short of its appearance and when it really comes down to plot and characters theres nothing special action is slow and minimal and the people are flat corny at times and do not act realistically not to mention the plot hole here and the plot hole there so in summary oh my goodness ive never seen an anime as beautiful as this one; and oh my goodness its like -poke- people dont act like that it took a giant step forward in graphics and music in anime but it also took a few step backs to times of bad characterization and unfortunately theres not even that much action to make up for that<SEP>0
i remember my parents not understanding saturday night live when i was 15 they also did not understand rock n roll and many other things now that i am approaching their age i still remember and find i understand many of the things my kids love but this is pathetic i cannot say i have seen any by sarah except for a few appearances here and there they were reasonable i do not see her as anything special but this show is just so far below what i expected from her the imdb write up made it sound like potential so just for that i started watching the first episode i turned it off half way through anything else is better that that jokes that are meant for a 5 year old presented on a supposed adult program well sarah this adult is inly moved to turn you off i just cant believe that someone actually financed this insult to comedy only good thing i can say is that there are sooooo many bad jokes deposited here saving other shows from such an embarrassment<SEP>0
1st the good news the 3-d is spectacularly well done and they dont go for the gotcha gimmicks the film is based on the true story of the high point in human history and even features one of the actual participants in that story: buzz aldrinand now the meat of the matter: its about flies for krissakes! flies with big googy human eyes true but flies nonetheless remember when i likened the underworld movies to rats vs cockroaches that wasnt intended as praise and i never dreamed anyone would take it literally this ones got even less empathy going for it baby maggots ugh in one of those odd confluences of hollywood groupthink this flik was evidently on the drawing boards at the same time as space chimps also about critters in spacego rent apollo 13 and see a 9-rated movie about the real space program rip<SEP>0

yokai monsters: spook warfare yokai daisenso 2005 a movie about yokai or traditional japanese monsters of folklore it is alternatively known as big monster war or as ghosts on paradethe yokai of the first installment include the teapot freak kappa water imp a living brella a woman whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic a woman with a second face on the back of her head a dwarf priest with an enormous gourd-like wrist & so onthese sorts of whimsical monsters derive not only from fairy lore but from a type of summer entertainment of the tokugawa era comparable to todays halloween haunted houses or the freak shows of yesteryear but with exclusively phony freaks ghosts & goldfish monsters & dancing one-headed umbrellas were trumped up to create chills during the hot summers the fatcheek woman & such were recreated by tricks or illusions based on monsters depicted in medieval scrolls; & if their design for the movie is a bit simple & hoky this makes them all the more representative of what historically was recreated for summer chillsthese rather endearing monsters have to face off & destroy an ancient babylonian vampire demon who has come to japan & disguised himself as a samurai lord despite that some of the japanese apparitions are a bit goofy & too many of the costumes scarsely more than masks without even moving lips as they speak it is all played very poker-faced & is very charming it has some beautiful cinematography much as would be provided in a cgi film of the same decade viewed in the right mood or with the right friends it is exciting moving & touchingyoshiyuki kuroda also directed the famed lone wolf & cub: white heaven & hell 1974 &and was the special fx director for the excellent daimajin trilogy the yokai monsters series is not the equal of majin at its best but the yokai are nevertheless great fun the first miike movie which is the most child-oriented of his family films with the gozu & izoo consecutively more serious though none too severe for young viewers<SEP>1

i grew up during the time that the music in this movie was popular what a wonderful time for music and dancing! my only complaint was that i was a little too young to go to the uso and nightclubs guess it sounds like im living in the past i do have wonderful memoriesso whats wrong with that!! world war 2 was a terrible time except where music was concerned glenn millers death was a terrible sadness to us this movie will be a favorite of mine clio laine was excellent; what a voice! i dont know how i ever missed this movie my main reason for this commentary is to alert the modern generation to an alternative to rap and new age music which is offensive to me please watch this movie and give it a chance!<SEP>1
if the only sex youve ever had is with a farm animal then the tag line for this movie is probably still misleadingthis is by far one of the most boring movies ive had the pleasure to try and watch lately i found the dvd lying around at my friends house and i made the sad mistake of not burning iti am unable to tell any details without spoiling the movie because there are only about 5 details to this movie just try to imagine someone making a movie about things on c-span only the fictional movie is 10 times less interesting than the most boring debate on c-spani think there is a conspiracy somewhere in this movie but i was unable to tell exactly what it was after i gouched my eyeballs out and threw them at richard gere<SEP>0

i think this is almost all i need to say i feel obliged to explain my actions though ive basically never seen such an armateur production and i mean that in all senses of the word although the physical camera work boom mic operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable unfortunately its not the only areasunlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great characterization and plot this unfortunately has an awful script awful acting and worst of all awful annoying charactersits a crime that for the every independent film that gets distribution like haiku tunnel theres a 101 other indie films that died silent deaths i dont know who the kornbluth brothers know at sony but that can be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution im quite bemused as to why they picked this upthe only part of this film that holds out any intrigue is its title however the reason for that is even a let down i hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it ive seen a lot of films in my time and im very forgiving when in the cinema but this was too much ill never forget tunnel for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema shame its such a low point<SEP>0

even 15 years after the end of the vietnam war jacknife came not too late or was even superfluous its one of the few that try to deal with the second sad side of the war: the time after different from movies like taxi driver or rambo which use to present their main characters as broken heroes in a bad after war environment this movie allows the audience to face a different view on the vietnam vets their development is shown very precisely before and especially after the war the problems are obvious but in all this tragic there is always the feeling of some hope on the basis of love and friendship jacknife might be the quietest vietnam movie ever but after almost 15 years this is really plausible and therefor justified moreover it can make us believe that the war has not finished yet; at least for some of usthe three main characters are amazing de niro has done one of his best jobs but ed harris is the star of this movie possiblythis was his best performance ever<SEP>1
the plot of this terrible film is so convoluted ive put the spoiler warning up because im unsure if im giving anything away the audience first sees some man in jack the ripper garb murder an old man in an alley a hundred years ago then were up to modern day and a young australian couple is looking for a house were given an unbelievably long tour of this house and the husband sees a figure in an old mirror some 105 year old woman lived there there are also large iron panels covering a wall in the den an old fashioned straight-razor falls out when theyre renovating and the husband keeps it i guess he becomes possessed by the razor because he starts having weird dreams oh yeah the couple is unable to have a baby because the husband is firing blanks some mold seems to be climbing up the wall after the couple removes the iron panels and the mold has the shape of a person late in the story there is a plot about a large cache of money & the husband murders the body guard & a co-worker and steals the money his wife is suddenly pregnant what the hell is going on who knows nothing is explained was the 105 year old woman the child of the serial killer the baby sister why were iron panels put on the wall how would that keep the serial killer contained in the cellar was he locked down there by his family & starved to death or just concealed who is mr hobbs and why is he so desperate to get the iron panels hes never seen again why was the serial killer killing people we only see the one old man murdered was there a pattern or motive or something why does the wife suddenly become pregnant is it the demon spawn of the serial killer has he managed to infiltrate the husbands semen and why if the husband was able to subdue and murder a huge burly security guard is he unable to overpower his wife and just how powerful is the voltage system in australia that it would knock him across the room simply cutting a light wire and why does the wife stay in the house is she now possessed by the serial killer is the baby going to be the killer reincarnated this movie was such a frustrating experience i wanted to call my pbs station and ask for my money back! the only enjoyable aspect of this story was seeing the husband running around in just his boxer shorts for a lot of the time but even that couldnt redeem this muddled incoherent mess<SEP>0
unfortunately because of us viewers tendency to shun subtitles this movie has not received the distribution nor attention it merits its subtle themes of belonging identity racial relations and especially how colonialism harms all parties transcend the obvious dramatic tensions the nostalgic memories of the protaganistes childhood and the exoticism of her relationship with her parents houseboy perhaps the only real human she knows we wont even look at her mothers relationship with this elegant man there! i hope ive given you enough of a hook to take it in whether you speak french or like subtitles or not i challenge you to be as brave strong and aware as la ptite<SEP>1
a police officer robert forster in a crime ridden city has his wife attacked and young son killed after she dares to stand up to a thug at a petrol station after the murderers get off scot-free thanks to a corrupt judge and he himself is jailed for 30 days for contempt of court he decides to take matters into his own hands by joining a group of vigilantes led by a grizzled looking fred williamson these robin hood types sort out any criminal that the law is unwilling to prosecute and with their help he attempts to track down those that wronged himthis film is nothing but a big bag oclichés the only thing out of the ordinary is the on-screen slaying of a two year old boy which was pretty sick otherwise its business as usual for this genre eg involves lots of car chases beatings and shootings mixed in with plenty of male posturing i could have done without the prison fight in the shower involving all those bare-a**ed inmates though also did they run out of money before filming the last scenes i mention this because it ends very abruptly with little closure if anyone knows give me a bell actually dont botherto conclude: file under forgettable nonsense next<SEP>0
return to cabin by the lake just was lacking it must have had a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera so within the same scene - youll have some movie-quality camera shots and simple video camera shots it makes for a very odd blend! i think they should have found some way to not do the home video type effect! i think its worthwhile to see it if you have seen the original cbtl because then you can compare and see the differences but if you havent seen the original cbtl youll never want to see it if you see this one first! it will probably seem way too cheesy and turn you off from even caring about the original one<SEP>0

a remake of the superb 1972 movie of the stage play nicely casting caine as the nemesis of his character from the first movie but doing nothing else nicely at alla under-parr performance from the actors law and caine diluted further by weak self-indulgent directionthe warmth of the setting in the original is forsaken for a super-modern homesetting the subtle interplay between oliver and caine which made the first movie so watchable is replaced with a horrid brash arrogance that instantly breeds disdain in the viewer but this is not the clever to-ing and froing of liking one then the other character the original fostered so well this is an obvious ott character assassination of both character from the word gothis version of sleuth is not really worth seeing watch the original film and be dazzled from the opening act<SEP>0

this is probably the most boring worse and useless film i have seen last year the plot that was meant to have some philosophical aspects emerged to me as a very bad hollow copy of the matrix with plenty of clichés: the lone wolf cop good looking psychologically disturbed sleeping with his gun + nice hard worker and shy but good looking she-scientist you add a 2 cent plot and you have i robot! i was terribly disturbed by the obvious advertising of brands like fedexaudiconverse etc this movie stinks the commercialization and tend to be more a poor ad spot that unfortunately will not end after 30 sec i wouldnt recommend this to my worse enemy if you have some spare time watch a good tv program instead or better read a nice book<SEP>0
this is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies once again it doesnt make since the killer still kills for fun but this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first movie which means that it is the stupidest movie everdont watch this if you value the one precious hour during this movie then dont watch it youll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it because it just doesnt combine the original makes of horror action and crimedont let your children watch this teenager young child or young adult this movie has that sorta impact upon people<SEP>0
it was everything this isnt: it had pace pop and actors who werent afraid to chew the scenery it also had a decent script this one had me scratching my head if farrah isnt really serious about a career why does she have a manager and why is he wasting his time if kate and barney are artists why do they sign up for the mother of all jiggle shows like the brady bunch movie where robert reed wants to do shakespeare only to find himself on bb they werent industry names but they werent exactly starving either and while they got the history right the poster was released before farrah got the show silverman rejecting pitches for funniest home videos and american idol and spelling promising his baby girl tori someday hell create a show for her obviously did not happenwhat bothered me was how spellings role is distorted hes shown as the show-runner and creator when he was neither and how he comes up with the idea for ca was is laughable!how were spelling and goldberg allowed to enforce farrahs oral contract when the others were signed and why didnt farrah or bernstein tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her inner diva but because majors wanted her to this is why when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting farrah up as the bad girl like suzanne somers it fails because the groundwork was never laid -- that was where the threes company pic delivered<SEP>0
greetings again from the darkness 18 directors of 18 seemingly unrelated vignettes about love in the city of lights a very unusual format that takes a couple of segments to adjust to as a viewer we are so accustomed to character development over a 2 hour movie it is a bit disarming for that to occur in an 8 minute segmentthe idea is 18 loverelationship stories in 18 different neighborhoods of this magnificent city of course some stand up better than others and some go for comedy while others focus on dramatic emotion some very known directors are involved including: the coen brothers wes craven alfonso cuaron alexander payne gus van sant and gurinda chadha many familiar faces make appearances as well: steve buscemi barbet schroeder catalina sandino moreno ben gazzara gena rowlands gerard depardieu juliette binoche willem dafoe nick nolte maggie gyllenhaal and bob hoskinsone of the best segments involves a mime and then another mime and the nerdy yet happy young son of the two mimes also playing key roles are a red trench coat cancer divorce sexual fantasy the death of a child and many other topics dont miss alexander payne director of sideways as oscar wildethe diversity of the segments make this interesting to watch but as a film it cannot be termed great still it is very watchable and a nice change of pace for the frequent movie goer<SEP>1
this is the second film ive seen of ida lupino as a director after 53s the hitch-hiker i think this one was a better film then that one this one has a girl who is about to get married and she is then sexually assaulted and doesnt like everyone looking and talking about her so she runs away and and is taken in by a family i think leonard maltins review is right only to give it 2 and 12 stars<SEP>1
there are some redeeming qualities to this show one is that the theme tune does have a decent melody the show does have a nice premise also i am probably in the minority but i like wanda i like the fact she is caring and is more a mother figure to timmy however despite all this i do not like this show it isnt excrement but i do find it very annoyingi wouldnt say that it is the best animated show on planet earth when i use that term for an animated tv show i think of peter pan and the pirates i think of darkwing duck i think of scooby doo and i think of talespin and i hope i am not the only one who really likes the wild thornberrys and resent the fact it gets poked fun at nor do i think fairly odd parents is the worst animated show on planet earth i accept its annoying and in some ways overrated but it isnt the worst show on nickolodean that is chalk zone god that show is unwatchable but the worst animated show ive ever seen is shaggy and scooby doo:get a clue which is crudely animated unfunny and frankly a disgraceone thing i dont like about this show is the animation the characters forgive me if i offend have very weird facial features and a lot of the backgrounds are dull and lack the colour that make spongebob squarepants and wild thornberrys so nice to look at the characters with the exception of wanda i find very annoying i cant believe such a talented voice actress like tara strongaka charendoff voiced timmy timmy i dont find very likable as a lead character at all he is annoying and sometimes patronising and he is a poor decision maker as well and his voice gets on my nerves i actually like strong but not in this show another annoying character is cosmo the supposedly funny character instead his jokes are as unfunny as they could become they are either a contrived or b over familiar timmys parents are awful characters who dont give a toss about their son and their personalities wear well thinthe story lines are very unoriginal on the most part and i keep thinking where have i seen this before the episodes after the arrival of the baby i thought were unwatchable even worse is the scripts very unfunny childish witless and suffer from a complete lack of energyall in all not the worst show ever but pretty poor for an animation fan and fairly uncomfortable to sit through 310- there are redeeming qualities and i completely understand if people like it bethany cox<SEP>0
madhur bhandarkar directs this film that is supposed to expose the lifestyle of the rich and famous while also providing a commentary on the integrity of journalism todaycelebrities party endlessly they like to be seen at these parties and to get due exposure in the media in fact the film would have us believe that this exposure makes celebrities out of socialites and the newspapers have a huge hand in this imo there is much more synergy between the celebrities and media and it is a i need you you need me kind of relationship however the media needs celebrities more and not vice versa anyhow in this milieu of constant partying is thrown the social column page 3 of the newspaper reporter konkana sen sharma she is shown as this celebrity maker very popular at the social gatherings she has a good friend in the gay abhijeet and in the struggling model rohit bikram saluja she rooms with an air-hostess  the sassy pearl sandhya mridul and a struggling actress - gayatri tara sharma the editor of the newspaper is boman irani and a firebrand crime beat reporter is played by atul kulkarni the movie has almost too many plot diversions and characters but does work at a certain level the rich are shown to be rotten to the core for the most part the movie biz shown to be sleazy to the max with casting couch scenarios exploitation of power hunger for media exposure into all this is layered in homosexuality a homosexual encounter that seems to not have much to do with the story or plot rampant drug use pedophilia police encounter deaths in light of all this pearls desire to have a super rich husband a socialite daughter indulging in a sexual encounter in a car the bitching women all seem benign illsthe film has absolutely excellent acting by konkana sen sharma atul kulkarni has almost no role  a pity in my opinion but the supporting cast is more than competent boman irani is very good this is what saves the film for me mr bhandarkar bites off way more than he can chew or process onto celluloid and turns the film into a free for all bash i wish he had focused on one or two aspects of societal ills and explored them more effectively he berates societal exploitation yet himself exploits all the masala ingredients needed for a film to be successful we have an item number in the framework of a bollywood theme party the drugged out kids dance a perfectly choreographed dance to a western beat i hope the next one from madhur bhandarkar dares to ditch even more of the hindi film stereotyped ingredients the film is a brave albeit flawed effort certainly worth a watch<SEP>1

this movie is hilarious! i watched it with my friend and we just had to see it again this movie is not for you movie-goers who will only watch the films that are nominated for academy awards you know who you arei wont recap it because you have seen that from all the other reviewswhipped is a light-hearted comedy that had me laughing throughout it doesnt take itself too seriously and should be watched with your friends not your girlfriend it wont win any awards but it just has to be watched to be appreciated true some of the jokes are toilet humor but that is not necessarily a bad thing everyone can use some of it sometimes some people need to lighten up and see whipped for what it is not what it isnt****14 out of *****<SEP>1
i only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title it now belongs to me as one of my very favourite films it is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the maysles discovered but everything in it works wonderfully it has so many memorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world i fell in love with this film and with the characters in it it is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric beales a true aristocratic family it has a tangible atmosphere and i found myself wishing i could be there away from it all cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table it has an air of sadness that permeates throughout a fall from greatness for this once esteemed family the money had gone but their airs and graces remained as well as their beauty it drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished i found myself wondering about their fate wondering that if i took a walk along east hampton beach i might still hear old edies voice in the night and see the silhouette of little edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper unforgettable<SEP>1
well if you like poppunk punk ska and a tad bit of modern psycho billy then seeing the live performances are about the only thing worth watching this movie has tons and tons of band cameos along with president of troma lloyd kaufman as a semi-major role and lots of goofy death scenes sounds like it may be good right well the deaths keep coming and repeatedly to many different bands of the warp tour and the fans at the event some of the deaths start of stylish but then they are recycled over and over to the point of being completely repetitive almost everyone dies of having their head smashed or intestines being pulled from their stomach the gore looks as if it was from andreas schnaas zombie 90: extreme pestilence; with this being the watered-down type blood but now that movie is actually decent and provides humor-something that this movie terribly lacks sure the movie is made by doug sakmann from troma its got great low-budget potential and it triesbut just too hard everything is overly meant to be funny in this movie and thats what brings it down everything tries to be too comic and goofy by using intentional bad acting an overuse of pointless deaths and doing the same thingover and over its basically mulva: zombie ass-kicker chairman of the board or any movie you have made with your friends: its funny to those who made it and thats about itgreat potential great idea great use of effects-but its the same thingover and over: a band plays a band dies fans die everyone dies blood is sprayed everywhere the process is repeatedthe question is for these types of movies-which is basically bad slap-stick-do they try too hard or not at all<SEP>0
i have recently seen this production on dvd it is the first time i have seen it since it was originally broadcast in 1983 and it was just as good as i remembered at first as was worried it would seem old fashioned and i suppose it is a little dated and very wordy as the bbc serials were back then i miss those wonderful costume dramas that seemed to be always on sunday afternoons back then but that aside it is as near perfect as it could have been i am a bit of a jane eyre purist as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is a faithful to the book as this one i have recently re-read the book as well and some of the dialogue is just spot on reading the scene near the end where rochester questions jane about what st john was like i noticed their words were exactly reproduced on screen by dalton and clarke and done perfectly all the other productions that have been done all seem lacking in some way some even leave out the rivers family and their connection to jane altogether i also think this is the only production to include the gypsy scene done correctlythe casting is perfect zelah clarke is like jane is described in the book small plain and dark and i disagree that she looked too old timothy dalton may be a little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect as rochester portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his socks off! i agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time like in the scene when he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted his expression is fantastically frightening but then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when jane runs down the stairs and into his arms the morning after they declare their love for one another a love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable oh to be loved by a man like that! there were a couple of scenes that were strangely missing however like when jane climbs in to bed with the dying helen and also when rochester takes jane shopping for her wedding things i thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricksfinally if you never see another production of jane eyre - you simply most see this one it is simply perfection!<SEP>1
yeti deserves the 8 star rating because it is the one of the greatest bad movies ever made i saw it at a midnight screening in la and people were roaring and cheering at the insanity - this movie is one of those cinematic trainwrecks where you think it cant get any stranger and then it does! the millionaire who funds the project to thaw the yeti looks like chris penn and john goodman both poured into an ill-fitting suit - the guy playing the scientist is one of the worst actors to ever appear on screen - and yes there is a mute boy who sorta kinda looks like a girl and hes mute ever since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents hmmm- maybe therapy for the kid then this hottie italian girl is seen by yeti once he thaws - which takes forever -- and he is instantly in love with her - what is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant yeti makes bedroom eyes at her - its like a large barry white trying to seduce a groupie in fact once the large yeti picks up the hottie and has her against his chest - she accidentally touches the yetis nipple and yes the film takes the time to show his large grey nipple get hard!!!! yikes of all yikes! plus theres a collie dog in it because the italian producer must have heard that american audiences like dogs and he sorta kinda tried to get a lassie - theres also this insane scene where the yeti eats a giant fish - keeps the large fishbone and uses it to comb the italian girls hair gee thanks yeti - now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout youre the best this film is more bizarre than something ed wood could have ever dreamt up if you are a fan of classic cinema crap - seek this baby out<SEP>1

i knew absolutely nothing about chocolat before my viewing of it i didnt know anything about the story the cast the director or anything about the films history all i knew was it was a highly-acclaimed french film had i known more i probably wouldnt have viewed the picture with an open mind on paper the premise doesnt sound interesting to me had i known what chocolat was about ahead of time my interest while watching would have been limited however not knowing about the story helped me enjoy it throughout i had no clue has to where the story would go what the characters would do and what the end result would be it was if nothing else not a predictable film indeed it could have been as the story is told in flashbacks telling a story in flashbacks is often a risky move on the part of the filmmakers since the lead character is seen in present day the audience knows she will remain alive by using the flashback technique director claire denis is able to ensure the audience that the young girl makes it to adulthood without any serious physical damage giving the viewer the sense that chocolat is a story more about emotions than what is on the outside a lesser filmmaker would give france a haggard-looking face one that screams of a confused and unusual childhood instead denis presents france as a beautiful girl someone who looks fine on the outside it could be argued that chocolat is more about frances mother since she is given far more screen time though i believe it is ultimately about france to me what chocolat is really about is how a mothers actions affect her daughter it is about how parents behavior stays with their offspring france is not ruined by her mothers actions in the story yet her mothers actions clearly made an impression on france had france not been affected at all by her mothers actions the flashback aspect would be irrelevant for a movie that deals with two time periods the past and the present chocolat was a very well paced there were no scene of excess fat none of the scenes felt gratuitous or out of the place the film had nice rhythm the editing crisp leaving only what was necessary to tell the story with a well told story solid editing and organized directing chocolat is one of the better french films i have seen it was responsible for launching claire denis career and with good reason: its an incredible directorial debut<SEP>1
the cliché of the shell-shocked soldier home from the war is here given dull treatment pity a splendid cast acting to the limits of their high talents cant redeem the return of the soldier from its stiff-collared inability to move the viewer to emotional involvement best moments as another reviewer noted come when glenda jackson is on screen; but even jacksons crackling good cinematic power cant pull this films chestnuts from its cold never warmed hearth ann-margret she of sex-kitten repute and too often accused of lacking acting ability finds her actual and rather profound abilities wasted here - despite her speaking with a nigh-flawless middlesex accent the hackneyed score redolent of many lackluster tv miniseries slathered-on saccharine emotionalism is at irritating odds with the emotional remoteness of the script blocking and overbaked formalism of the direction; except for its score and corseted script and direction the return of the soldier has all the right bits but it fails to make them work together<SEP>0
charlottes deadly beauty and lethal kicks make the movie cooler than itd be otherwisethe story is so poor and charlottes character dies in such a foolish way that you wonder if thiss the ending they had thought of for this movie i wish somebody could tell that an alternative ending exists but i fear it doesnt as for the rest of the cst well id say they simply didnt act very well; although the blame should be put on the poor scriptthis movie reminds me of rush hour 2 where zhang ziyi dies in absurd way since she had been the only one who had stolen the show during the whole movie i could give this movie 25<SEP>0
laid up and drugged out as a kidney stone wended its merry way through my scarred urinary tract with absolutely nothing better to do than let the painkillers swoon me into semi-oblivion i happened to catch this movie on cable i wouldnt want anyone to think that i paid to view it in a cinema or rented it or  heaven forfend!  that i watched it straighthaving played this sensationally gruesome video game and avidly trod the doomed rooms and dread passageways of the house battling chariot type 27 the hanged man type 041 and other impossible sentinels my curiosity was piqued as to how the game would transfer to the movie screenit doesntthe banal plot revolves around a group of crazy kids  a la scooby doo  attending a remote island for a world-shaking rave  whatever that is you kids today with your hula-hoops and your mini-skirts and your pat boone after bribing a boat captain thousands in cash to ferry them there a stupidity which begs its own network of rhetoric they find the rave desertedpassing mention is made of a house  presumably the titular house of the dead  but most of the action takes place on fake outdoor sets and other locales divorced from any semblance of haunted residencea fallen video camera acts as flashback filler showing the island in the throes of a  party! is that it oh so this rave thingy is just a party in the grand tradition of re-euphemizing used cars as pre-owned or shell shock as post-traumatic stress disorder the word party is now too square for you drug-addled silicone-implanted metrosexual jagoffs it is learned that the party was broken up by rampaging zombies intelligent thought stops here i dont think the pinheads who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the mythos behind zombie re-animation zombies cant die  theyre already un-dead they do not bleed they know no pain unless their bodies are completely annihilated they will continue being animated at least thats what my jamaican witch priestess tells mewhich means that a 45 shot into their hearts is not going to stop them nor will a machete to the torso and a shotgun blast to the chest will certainly not bring forth gouts of blood at least in the video games logic the shooter pumps so many rounds into each monster that it is completely decimated leaving a fetid mush that cannot re-animate itselfyet each actor-slash-model gets their matrix-circular-camera moment slaying zombies on all fronts with single bullets and karate chops to the sternum seriously these zombies are more ineffective than the stormtroopers from return of the jedi who get knocked out when ewoks trip themi suppose the films writer mark altman having penned the not-too-shabby free enterprise felt compelled to insert a captain kirk reference in the character of jurgen prochnow who must have needed milk money desperately to have succumbed to appearing in this aromatic dung-swill there is also a reference to prochnows primo role in the magnificent das boot when one of the untrained b-actors mentions that he looks like a u-boat captain i wonder how many of this movies target audience of square-eyed swine picked up on any of the snide references to other films as when prochnow declares say hello to my little friend presaging his machine gun moment aimed at a demographic who have not the wherewithal to comprehend the sisyphean futility of the video-game concept ie the game ends when you die  you cannot win this is merely a slasher film for the mindless and mindless at heart accordingly everyone dies in due course except for a heterosexual pair of attractive white peoplea better use for this films scant yet misused budget might have been to send the cast through acting school although ona grauers left breast did a good job as did her right breast  and those slomo running scenes: priceless! i especially liked the final scene with ona trying to act like shes been stabbed but looking like shes just eaten ice cream too fastattempting to do something more constructive with my time i pulled out my digitally-restored 35th anniversary special edition widescreen anamorphic dvd of manos: the hands of fate ah yes!  the drugs were suitably brain-numbing - now here was some quality film-making movie maniacs visit: wwwpoffysmoviemaniacom<SEP>0
girlfight is like your grandmothers cooking: same old recipe youve tried a million times before yet somehow transformed into something fresh and new try and explain the story to people who havent seen it before: a young women from the wrong side of the tracks attempts to improve her situation by taking up boxing whilst dealing with a bitter obstructive father and her growing attraction to a male rival watch them roll their eyes at the string of clichés and theyre right: it *is* clichéd yet i was hypnotized by how well this film works due to the frequently superb acting and dialogue and sensitive direction that makes it new i avoided this at the cinema because it looked like complete crap but dont make the same mistake i did definiately worth a look<SEP>1
i really enjoyed the 60s not being of that generation im waiting for the 80s it was interesting to see a unique four hour capsule for that eraone major problem in the movie however was how unbalanced the film was in the portrayal of the families according to promos i saw for the movie on nbc the story was basically about two families struggling with issues in 1960s america now i may have missed something but i think we learned more about the white family than the african american familyi really think that the 60s uses music to describe the scenes better than any dialogue that could come out of the mouths of the actors all of which are very talented this is very visible at the end of the first part about two hours in of the mini-seriesvery good movie!<SEP>1
men in black 2 was a real disappointment for me while the actors did a pretty good job especially smith there just isnt a cure for a poor script once in production the movie really had a sequel kind of feel playing off partial events of the first film the story was in a word bad at best it wasnt thought out well and seemed very choppy and incoherent at timesin the first flick the mib organization had a kind of elite force feel you had a few special agents and it had a clandestine kind of feel to it in the sequel the mib organization has a jrotc summer camp vibethe movie wasnt terrible or anything it just lacked the coolness for lack of a better phrase of the first movie a lot of the same old humor was recycled from the first to the second and didnt really add any originality to the mib universea perfect analogy would be episode 1 to the first 3 films was it decent yeah is it worthy of bearing its title not really<SEP>0
believe me i wanted to like spirit the idiotic comments people made at the time of its release about how quaint it was to see old-fashioned hand-drawn animation again as if the last pencil-animated cartoon had been released twenty years ago and the even more idiotic comments about how computers had now made the old techniques obsolete had got my blood up but then the insulting flavourless banality i had to endure in the first ten minutes of spirit got my blood up even morethe character designs are generic the animation partly as a result merely competent the art direction as a whole so utterly boringly lacklustre that you wonder how it could have come about we know from the prince of egypt and the road to el-dorado that there are talented artists at dreamworks and the sophisticated use of cgi is in every single instance ill-judged why do they bother theres not a single thing worth looking at in an animated cartoon this is fatalbut it gets worsethe horses cant talk but theyre far more anthropomorphised and unconvincing than the deer in bambi which can and it seems that in a way the horses can talk spirit himself delivers the prologue sounding for all the world like a 21st-century actor picked out of a shopping mall in california and from then on his laid-back decidedly unhorselike narration is scarcely absent from the soundtrack although it never once tells us anything that we didnt already know or expresses a feeling which the artwork poor though it is wasnt capable of expressing twice as well that prologue by the way: a contains information which spirit we later discover had know way of knowing; b expresses ideas which spirit would lack the power to express even if he could talk; c includes new age rubbish like this story may not be true but its what i remember; and d will give countless children the production is pitched i presume at six-year-olds the impression that horses are native to north america which is sort of true in that the common ancestor of domestic horses zebras etc was native to north america - but all horse species on the continent had gone extinct long before the first humans arrived and the mustangs of spirits herd which allegedly belong here like the buffalo grass were descended from horses introduced by europeansso the prologue rather annoyed meas often as spirit talks bryan adams sings sounding as usual as though hes got a bad throat infection - and its not that he sings or even how he sings its what he sings: maudlin narrative ballads which contribute even less if possible than spirits spoken narrative and which sound as though they all have exactly the same tune although i was paying close attention and was able to discern that they probably didnt if only bryan adams and the guy-pretending-to-be-a-horse could have shut up for a minute or two the movie might have been allowed to take its true form: mediocre and derivative rather than jaw-droppingly bad<SEP>0

filmfour are going to have to do a lot better than this little snot of a film if theyre going to get the right sort of reputation for themselvesthis film is set in glasgow although only a couple of secondary characters have anything approaching a scottish accent the premise about people whos lives are going nowhere who all meet up in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning as they have night jobs could have made for a really funny insightful quirky cultish film instead we have a group of self-obsessed saddos and a plot which has been so done to bits im suprised it hasnt been banned x and y are friends x is sleeping with z y sleeps with z as well oh you figure it outa total waste of time painful dialogue - it sounded like something that a group of 16 year olds would have written for a gcse drama project the female character was completely superfluous - just written in as a token female in the hope that women would be cajoled into seeing itif youre the sort of thicko lad who laughs at beer adverts and can usually be found wandering round in packs shouting on saturday nights in nondescript town centres then you will love this film and find it a right laff everyone else run dont walk away from this sorry little misfitand one question when the group left the boring seaside town saltcoats incidentally although they changed the name on the film to go back to glasgow why did they do it via the forton motorway services at lancaster which is in england<SEP>0

i dont give much credence to aids conspiracy theories but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized in the early years of the aids epidemic the suffering and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies this was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demi-monde of san francisco the city renowned for its beauty has rarely appeared uglier than in this film a sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scenewhile the acting and plot cant be said to be well-done the films unique cultural context and oppressively dark mood at least partly saves the film from being a complete loss actually i found the most interesting performance to be irit levi as a crusty and cynical jewish lesbian police detective shes interesting though not necessarily convincinghighlights: the films use of the garishly tragic turandot is an effective motif and there is a sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist ron athey<SEP>0
this an free adaptation of the novels of clarence mulford; fans of the willaim boyd films will probably feel a little at sea here and the reviews here so far reflect that but i knew of hopalong from the novels first and never cared much for the boyd films once i got around to themchristopher coppola has made a wise choice - he has not made a nostalgic western; instead he has approached the cassidy story as a slice of what we used to call americana; or what older critics once called homespun as the film unraveled i found myself more and more reminded of the great hallmark theater version of mark twains roughing it with james garner narratingboth these films remind us that although films about the old west are probably always to be mythic for americans they need not be westerns; they can very well be just films about what it meant to be american in that time in that placei never feel pandered to watching this film; theres no effort to shove the boyd-cassidy legacy down our throats no irony no camp consequently i get a sense of these characters as having walked - or ridden horseback - across some real western america i too could have walked a hundred years agogiven that the plainness of the film - it positively avoids anything we have come to call style - is all to its favor; and the plain acting of the performers fits neatly in with this; gosh it really does feel like some story told around a campfire on a cattle drive - no visual dressing just the quirks and good humor - and sudden violence - that we expect from the good narration of an adventure yarn i was very pleasantly surprised by this film and if the viewer sets aside encultured expectations he or she will find considerable pleasure in iti would have given this film 9-stars but ill give it a ten just because most reviewers here have missed the point completely; and i urge them to set their memories of boyd aside and give this film another chancenote 1: a reviewer complained that hopalong shoots people dead in this film rather than shooting the guns out of their hands ala boyds cassidy; first cassidy does shoot people dead in the novels; second if cassidy were a real cowboy he would have shot people dead - the problem with shooting guns out of peoples hands is that they can always get another gun - which happens to be part of the subtext of this very filmnote 2: i admit that i am jealous of the coppola family that they have the director of the godfather among them who can get them all opportunities to make movies that i cant; but a good movie is a good movie; and this is a good movie if its by somebody by the name coppola well thats just is as it is america is the land of opportunity or was until bush got into office - thats what the great american novels are all about<SEP>1
film noir is an overused expression when it comes to describing films every crime drama seems to be a noir but where the sidewalk ends really is a good example of what the genre is all aboutvery briefly an overzealous detective andrews accidentally kills a no-goodnik who works for the mobsters the killing is blamed on the father tom tully of a woman andrews meets and falls for tierney to save dad from old sparky andrews captures the rest of the mob and turns himself inthe morally guilty cop is driven by impulses from the past his father was a thief who was killed trying to shoot his way out of jail but that doesnt excuse his actions after he accidentally offs the no-goodnik in self defense he immediately goes to the phone to report the incident but he hesitates hes already in hot water with the department and this could finish his career then at just the wrong moment the phone rings its andrews partner and andrews tells him the suspect theyre trailing isnt at home he hides the body and later disposes of it by slugging a watchman and dumping the body in the riverwhat motivates a guy to do something so dumb okay his job was at risk but now hes committed multiple felonies at least i think they must be multiple i counted obstruction of justice assault disposing of a body without a permit littering first-degree mopery and bearing false witness against his neighborin the end we dont know whether to root for andrews or not the suspect didnt deserve to die true but it was after all an accident because andrews didnt know he was a war hero and had a silver plate in his head maybe its that kind of ambiguity that made noir what it was among other things such as characteristic lighting if noir involved nothing more than black-and-white photography murder criminals mystery and suspicious women then wed have to include all the charlie chan movies under that rubricandrews is pretty good hes a kind of mark macpherson from laura gone bitter he never laughs and rarely smiles even when seated across a restaurant table from gene tierney a situation likely to prompt smiles in many men he has no sense of humor at all his few wisecracks are put-downs when he shoves a stoolie into a cab and the stoolie says careful i almost hit my head andrews riposte is thats okay the cabs insured andrews could seem kind of wooden at times but this is a role that calls for stubborn and humorless determination and he handles it well his underplaying is perfect for the part little twitches or blinks project his thoughts and emotional states and i guess the director otto preminger stopped him from pronouncing bullet as boo-let and police as poe-lice never could make up my mind about gene tierney she does alright in the role of tom tullys daughter a model but shes like marilyn monroe in that you cant separate the adopted mannerisms from the real personality traits did tierney actually have such an innocent almost saintly persona when she answered the phone at home did her voice have the same sing-along quality that it has on screen poor tierney went through some bad psychiatric stuff before there were any effective meds for bipolar disorder and andrews too nice guy though he appears to have been slipped into alcoholism before finally recovering and making public service announcementsthe dvd commentary by peter muller is unpretentious informed and sometimes amusinganyway this is a good film as well as a good example of film noir the good guys arent all good although the bad guys are all bad maybe that ambiguity is what makes it an adult picture instead of a popcorn movie for the kiddies only one shot is fired on screen and nobodys head explodes sorry<SEP>1
in the many films i have seen warren oates i have come to a definite conclusion here is one talented individual i first saw mr oates back in the 1960s television series called stoney burke from then on i followed his career closely and felt he was destined for great roles that happened in 1974 when sam peckinpah gave him top billing in a film called bring me the head of alfredo garcia of course his biggest claim to fame was his magnificent role in the wild bunch i have always thought he was quite able to bring any character a certain magic that is until i saw him in this flop the movie is called chandler a tribute to the iron fisted detectives of the 1950s created by raymond chandler because the synopsis said it was about a hard nose private eye i was immediately interested however i sat patiently through the entire film and found it to be a dull dis-interesting slow pace twisted confusing saga which if it had a theme or plot must have been left on some dark back room self collectively and with some of hollywoods best supporting stars such as alex dreier mitch ryan gordon pinsent charles mcgraw richard loo and scatman crothers this movie had enough power to reach mach five however it fizzled on the launchpad and went no where as a result one of my favorite actors got stuck in a poorly made vehicle which never got off the ground **<SEP>0
an unusual take on time travel: instead of traveling to earths past the main trio get stuck in the past history of another planet they beam down to this planet whose sun is scheduled to go nova in 3 or 4 hours thats cutting it close! in some kind of futuristic library they meet mr atoz a to z get it ha-ha and his duplicates it turns out instead of escaping their planets destruction via space travel the usual way the inhabitants have all escaped into their planets various past time eras mr atoz uses a time machine to send people on their way after they make a selection check out the discs we see here another trek prognostication of cds and dvds! when mr atoz prepares the machine the atavachron-what-sis gallant kirk hears a womans scream and runs into the planets version of earths 17th century where he gets into a sword fight and is arrested for witchery theres an eccentric but good performance here by the actress playing a female of ill repute in this time using phrasing of the time youre a bully fine coo witch! witch! theyll burn ye! spock & mccoy follow kirk but end up in an ice age 5000 years earlierkirk manages to get back to the library first the real story here is spocks reversion to the barbaric tendencies of his ancestors the warlike vulcans of 5000 years ago this doesnt really make sense except that maybe this time machine is responsible for the change even so spock & mccoy werent prepared by atoz - oh well; it also seems to me spock was affected by the transition almost immediately - he mentions being from millions of light years away instead of the correct hundreds or thousands - a gross error for a logical vulcan in any case spock really shows his nasty side here - forget day of the dove and remember this side of paradise - mccoy quickly finds out that his vulcan buddy will not stand for any of his usual baiting and nearly gets his face rearranged spock also gets it on with zarabeth a comely female who had been exiled to this cold past as punishment a couple of trek novels were written about spocks son the result of this union all these scenes are eye-openers a reminder of just how much spock conceals or holds in its also ironic that only a few episodes earlier requiem for methuselah mccoy was pointing out to spock how he would never know the pain of love - and now all this happens kirk meanwhile tussles with the elderly atoz who insists that kirk head back to some past era you are evidently a suicidal maniac - great stuff from actor wolfe last seen in bread and circuses it all works out in the end but like i mentioned earlier they cut it very close a neat little trek adventure with a definite cosmic slant<SEP>1
you do not get more dark or tragic than othello and this movie captures the play fairly well with outstanding performances by lawrence fishburne and irene jacob fishburnes expresses to the viewer othellos torment as he falls prey to iagos lies very convincingly even providing a realistic epileptic episode jacob is the loving and loyal wife who becomes either the instrument of iagos revenge against othello or the object of his wrath it is not clear which since no motive for iagos behavior is offered although kenneth brannagh sp displays his usual talent for shakespeare in this movie he is somewhat marginalized the characters of cassio and emilia also wander in and out of scenes even though they like iago seem more crucial to the plot i have not checked the movie against the play to see how many lines were cut out but i know that shakespeare tends to develop his characters even the seemingly unimportant ones very wellif i had any criticism of the movie it would be that the story unfolds too quickly and that the relationships between some of the characters are not laid out more the director had a great cast and no one offered a bad performance the relationship between cassio and othello and that between emilia and desdemona need to be further developed earlier in the film i have a feeling that they were closer to each other than the movie suggests although you get a sense of this very late into the movie also othello and desdemona need more time together although their anguish is convincing the amount of interaction they have with each other makes it seem like they just met on the other hand maybe the did just meet---like romeo and julietin brief: good performances too short<SEP>1
i think it great example of the differences between two cultures it would be a great movie to show in a sociology class i thought it was pretty funny and i must say that i am a sucker for that lets band together and get the job done plot device it seems most people dont realize that this movie is not just a comedy it has a few dramatic elements in it as well and i think they blend in nicely overall i give it a solid 8<SEP>1
i have spent the last week watching john cassavetes films - starting with a woman under the influence and ending on opening night i am completely and utterly blown away in particular by these two films from the first minute to the last in opening night i was completely and utterly absorbed ive only experienced it on a few occasions but the feeling that this film was perfect lasted from about two thirds in right through till the credits came up everything about this film from the way it was shot the incredible performance of gena rowlands the credits the opening the music the plot the sense of depth the pace the tenderness the originality the characters the deft little moments for me is truly sublime i couldnt agree more with the previous comment about taking it to a desert island because the sheer depth of this film is something to behold if your unlucky enough to have a house fire i guarantee that instead of making a last ditch attempt to rescue that stash of money under your bed youll be rescuing your copy of this film instead<SEP>1
i watched this film few times and all i can say that this is low budget rubbish and that it does not have anything to do with a real history facts actors performances is very poor but it is result of limited acting possibilities anyone who watched this film now probably think of hitler as some crazy skinny lunatic who running with a gun like some chicago gangster i can only to say that there is much better films about hitler and germany in those years and that rise of evil is very much under average i can recommend german film downfall in which you can see brilliant performance of switzerland actor bruno ganz in a roll of adolf hitler<SEP>0
the film maybe goes a little far but if you love the show its what you expect its not a bad movie; its actually pretty good if you dont like the show dont see the movie it starts off a little slow maybe but then picks up and turns out to be pretty funny there are even a few heart-wrenching scenes toward the end after all the protagonists have gone through these scences do get to you also jerry throws in his opinion why his show upsets people and justifies his shows existience hes got a pretty good point we care so much about the private details of celebrities lives so why is it wrong that these people tell their private lives on national tv too if they were celebrities we wouldnt mind at all wed eat it up do we not like his guest doing this just because theyre poor white trash and it reminds us that there really is poverty in this world and not just rich glamous movie stars living in a leave it to beaver world<SEP>1
this clever film was originally a japanese film and while i assume that original film was pretty bad it was made a good bit worse when american-international films hacked the film to pieces and inserted american-made segments to fool the audience now unless your audience is made of total idiots it becomes painfully obvious that this was done--and done with little finesse or care about the final product the bottom line is that you have a lot of clearly japanese scenes and then clearly american scenes where the film looks quite different plus the american scenes really are meaningless and consist of two different groups of people at meetings just talking about gamera--the evil flying turtle! and although this is a fire-breathing flying and destructive monster there is practically no energy because i assume the actors were just embarrassed by being in this wretched film--in particular film veterans brian donlevy and albert dekker they both just looked tired and ill-at-ease for being therenow as for the monster its not quite the standard godzilla-like creature seeing a giant fanged turtle retract his head and limbs and begin spinning through the air like a missile is hilarious on the other hand the crappy model planes destructible balsa buildings and power plant are as usual in this film and come as no surprise plus an odd japanese monster movie cliché is included that will frankly annoy most non-japanese audience members and that is the adorable and precocious little boy who loves the monster and believes in him yeah right well just like in godzilla versus the smog monster and several other films youve got this annoying creep cheering on the monster though unlike later incarnations of godzilla gamera is not a good guy and it turns out in the end the kid is just an idiot! silly exceptional poor special effects that could be done better by the average seven year-old bad acting meaningless american clips and occasionally horrid voice dubbing make this a wretched film oddly while most will surely hate this film and that stupid kid there is a small and very vocal minority that love these films and compare them to bergman and kurosawa dont believe them--this is a terrible film!fyi--apparently due to his terrific stage presence gamera was featured in several more films in the 60s as well as some recent incarnations none of these change the central fact that he is a fire-breathing flying turtle or that the movies are really really lame<SEP>0
kurt russells chameleon-like performance coupled with john carpenters flawless filmmaking makes this one without a doubt one of the finest boob-tube bios ever aired it holds up too: the emotional foundation is strong enough that itll never age; carpenter has preserved for posterity the power and ultimate poignancy of the life of the one and only king of rock and roll id been a borderline elvis fan most of my life but it wasnt until i saw this mind-blowingly moving movie that i looked beyond the image at the man himself it was quite a revelation elvis remains one of the top ten made-for-tv movies of all time<SEP>1
i usually steer clear of tv movies because of the many ways you know that its tv movies five seconds into the picture this one got my attention because of the unusual title and its gloomy well-crafted mood that is established from the very start while the ever present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misplaced story even if claiming to be set in california the movie was largely shot around a stormy vancouver bc the dark and oppressive outdoors beautifully complement olmos excellent acting<SEP>1
the cover art which features a man holding a scary pellet gun would make it seem as if its a martial arts film hardlyi find it interesting that the films real title is trojan warrior trojan is a brand of condoms in the us this movie is loaded with homoeroticism if you like that stuff then this film isnt that bad really however consider these points:there are numerous close-ups of actors groins & butts one scene even features every actor with an erection bulging in his pants the film is also bathed in gaudy colors like lime peach and red from a cinematographers standpoint this movies a drag queen! several scenes feature characters standing extremely close to one another occasionally touching as they converse also the cousin of the hero likes women and every other guy in the movie is trying to kill him is there a message here the filmmakers want to convey shall i go into the fight scenes yes someones private parts get grabbed in one fight the martial arts scenes are brief and unimaginative no fancy stuff here just your standard moves youd see in an old chuck norris flick theres also a car chase scene which may be the first ever low-speed chase put on film<SEP>0
in one of neil simons best plays creaky cranky ex-vaudeville stars played by walter matthau and george burns are teaming up for a tv comedy special the problem is they havent even seen each other in over a decade full of zippy one liners and inside showbiz jokes this story flies along with a steady stream of humor good work also by richard benjamin as the harried nephew rosetta lenoire as the nurse and howard hesseman as the tv commercial director steve allen and phyllis diller appear as themselves trivia note: the opening montage contains footage from hollywood revue of 1929 and shows marie dressler bessie love polly moran cliff edwards charles king gus edwards and the singing brox sisters<SEP>1
in light of the recent and quite good batman the brave and the bold now is the time to bear a fatal blow to that mistake in the life of batman being a huge fan since the first revival by tim burton 20 years ago i have been able to accept different tonalities in the character dark or campy this one is just not credible : too many effects poor intrigues and so few questions what is great about batman is the diversity of his skills and aspects of his personality : detective crime-fighter playboy philanthropist etc the batman shows him only in his karate days and by the way how come the penguin is capable of such virtuosity when jumping in the air regardless of his portly corpulence and look at the joker a mixture of blanka in street fighter 2 and a stereotypical reggae man what batman fan could accept such a treason not me anyway batman is much better without the article in front of his name<SEP>0
oh man i know what your thinking: with a title like that i cant go wrong! uh yes you can i too loved the title but man i hated the stupid kid that played satans little helper i hated the mom too and the sisterdaughter and her boyfriend - i hated all those people! man it was agony watching this sometimes! the only reason this doesnt get 110 is becuz condsidering the low budget they did ok but oh man did i hate those actors so stupid! i knew it was going to be bad i guess they saved a lot of money on just using halloween masks for the killer and the jesus costume at the end was really stupid too oh the agony do not watch!<SEP>0
how did i ever appreciate this dud of a sequel all it does is throw balls! worst of all it doesnt compare to even the first installment of the series! the comedy suffers from not being funny where did all the unintentional laughter go enough slapstick on-the-field action goes on too long bob uecker literally saved this one from a complete nine-inning shutout whats next major league 4: return to the little league ehh could be! leave this one on the shelf and plan a trip to the all-star game this ones had three strikes too many<SEP>0
dick tracy is one of my all time favorite films i must admit to those that havent seen it you will either really love it or really hate it it came out a year after the success of batman so everyones expectations were so high that many were let down simply because the plot is so simple but its based on a comic stripwhat did you expect creatively this movie is amazing! the sets make-up music costumes and the impressive acting make this film fantastic the film has bloodless violence and no bad language - thats something rare these days directed produced and stars warren beatty as the ace crime fighter going up against al pacinos evil big boy caprice and his mob of thugs madonna steals the show as the seductive breathless mahoney this is one of the best characters madonna has ever played she has the best one liners ive heard! madonna fans would love it! one of the coolest things about the film is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic strip this film is truly a piece of artwork that is sadly overlooked by the public to sum things up this film brings out the child in all of us its a film that will leave you smiling at the end<SEP>1
police investigations murder suspicion: we are all so acquainted with them in movies galore most of the films nowadays deal with crime which is believed to involve viewers to provide them with a thrilling atmosphere however most of thrill lovers will rather concentrate on latest movies of that sort forgetting about older ones yet it occurs that these people may easily be misled a film entirely based on suspicion may be very interesting now despite being more than 20 years oldit is garde a vue a unique movie by claude milleris there much of the action not really since the events presented in the movie take place in a considerably short time but the way they are executed is the movies great plus jerome charles martinaud michel serrault is being investigated by inspector gallien lino ventura and insector belmont guy marchand its a new years eve a rainy evening and not very accurate for such a meeting yet after the rape and murder of two children at the dawn of the old year the door of suspicion must be open at last in other words more quoted from the movie it must be revealed who an evil wolf really is to achieve this one needs lots of effort and also lots of emotions from both partiessome people criticize the script for being too wordy yet i would ask them: what should an investigation be like if not many questions and practically much talk this wordiness touches the very roots of the genre in no way is this boring but throughout the entire film it makes you as a viewer as an observer involved moreover the film contains well made flashbacks as the stories are being told not too much and not too little of them - just enough to make the whole story clearer and more interesting the most memorable flashbacks for me are when chantal romy schneider martinauds wife talks about one lovely christmas but these flashbacks also contain the views of the places including the infamous beach it all wonderfully helped me keep the right pace and since i saw garde a vue i always mention this film as one of the defenders of french cinema against accusations of mess and chaos but those already mentioned aspects may not necessarily appeal to many viewers since they might not like such movies and still wont find the content and its execution satisfactory yet garde a vue is worth seeing also for such people why for the sake of performances but here dont expect me to praise foremost romy schneider garde a vue is not romy schneider vehicle she does a terrific job as a mother who is deeply in despair for a lost child she credibly portrays a person who is calm concrete who does not refuse an offered cup of tea but who does not want to play with words her part which includes a profound talk of life and duty is brilliant more credible than the overly melancholic role of elsa in la passante de sans souci it is still acted however romy schneider does not have much time on screen practically she appears for the first time after 45 minutes from the credits; she as a wife and a different viewpoint comes symbolically with the new year at midnight her role is a purely supporting one who really rocks is lino ventura he is the middle aged inspector antoine gallien who wants to find out the truth who is aware that his questions are missiles towards the other interlocutor but does not hesitate he is an inspector who having been married three times is perfectly acknowledged of womens psyche he is the one who does not regard his job as a game to play but a real service finally he is a person who does not find it abnormal to sit there on new years eve michel serrault also does a fine job expressing fear particularly in the final scenes of the movie but thumbs up for mr ventura brilliant!as far as memorable moments are concerned this is not the sort of film in which this aspect is easily analyzed the entire film is memorable has to be seen more than once and has to be felt with its atmosphere and which i have not mentioned before gorgeous music for me the talk of chantal and inspector gallien is the most brilliant flawless moment you are there with the two characters you experience their states of mind if you go deeper into what you seegarde a vue is a very interesting film a must see for thrill lovers and connoisseurs of artistic performances new year has turned andis it now easier to open the door youll find out when you decide to see the memorably directed movie by claude miller 810<SEP>1
i am beginning to see a very consistent pattern form in the identity of 2007s films if 2004 was the year of the biographies and 2005 was the year of the political films 2007 can be identified as a year featuring a wide plethora of morality tales films that portray test challenge and question human morality and the motives that drive us to do certain things although this identification is rather broad i think that there are a handful of films released this year such as 3:10 to yuma eastern promises american gangster no country for old men and others that specifically question and study human morals and the motives that drive us to acts such as violence or treachery before the devil knows youre dead is a deviously stylish morality tale and quite a dark bleak and depressing one at that and even better is the fact that it comes from one of the greatest classic directorial forces of our time the legendary sidney lumet who many have said has passed his prime but returns in full force with this viciously rich crime thrillerits one of those films whose plots are so thick that one is very reluctant to go into details it is a movie that is best enjoyed if entered without any prior knowledge to the events about to unfold as there are twists and turns but the thick and richly wrought plot is not at all at the center of this film; the true focus is as i mentioned the morality tale; the motives that drive these two men to the actions they do in the film in a plot structured like a combination between the filmographies of both the coen brothers namely blood simple and fargo and quentin tarantino we see two men driven under various shady circumstances to pull off a fairly simple crime that goes incredibly ridiculously wrong and reciprocates with full force and inevitable tragedy and to make it all the more interesting the film is told in a fragmented chronology that keeps back tracking and showing a series of events following a different character every time and always ending up where it left off the last time sizzling sharp thick and precariously depressing kelly mastersons screenplay is surprisingly poignant and well rounded in particular because it is a debut screenplaybut the film has much more going for it than just its delectably sinister and quite depressing plot first and foremost the picture looks and feels outstandingly well sidney lumet has throughout his career consistently employed an interesting style of cinematography and lighting: naturalistic and yet stylish at the same time the film carries with it a distinctive air of style and class with wonderful natural lighting that just looks really great editing is top-notch; combining the sizzling drama-thriller aspect with great long takes that really take their time to portray the action accordingly and vivid dynamic camera angles and movements further add to the style the film is also backed by a fantastically succulent musical score by carter burwellthe screenplay does its part and of course lumet does his part but at the films dramatic center are three masterful actors who deliver incredibly good performances first and foremost there are the two leads leading the pack is philip seymour hoffman who has always been an excellent actor but has stumbled upon newfound leading-man status after his unnaturally fantastic oscar-winning performance in capote his turn in this film is fascinating: severely flawed broken manic hoffman has some truly intense scenes in the film that really allow his full dramatic fury to come out and not just his subtlety and wit at his side is ethan hawke who has delivered some fantastic performances in many films that are almost always overshadowed by greater grander actors here he bounces off hoffman and complements him so incredibly well; in all the dynamic acting between the two of them is just so utterly fantastic and convincing the audience very quickly loses itself in the characters and forgets that its watching actors and then theres albert finney such a supple opulent supporting role like the one he has requires a veteran professional and here finney delivers his finest performance in many years as the tragically obsessed father to the two brothers who get caught up in the crime i love how the dynamics between the three of them play out i love how hoffman is clearly the dominant brother and shamelessly picks on his younger brother even now that theyre middle-aged men; and yet despite this it is clear how finneys father favours hawkes younger weaker brother also on the topic of the cast the two supporting female characters  wives of the brothers  also feature fantastic performances from amy ryan and marisa tomei whose looks just get better and better as the years go bythis film isnt revolutionary these themes and this style have already been explored by the likes of the coen brothers and its very easy to imagine them directing this film but for a film that treads familiar ground it simply excels lumet employs his own immense directorial talent and employs his unique and very subtle sense of irony and style to mastersons brilliantly vivid intense and morbidly depressing first-time screenplay the lead performances are incredibly intense and the film features absolutely fantastic turns from hoffman hawke and finney; but the truly greatest wonder of the film is that three years after he won a lifetime achievement oscar much revered as the ultimate sign of retirement in the film business sidney lumet proves that he still has the immense talent to deliver a truly wonderful resonant intense piece of cinema reminiscent of his golden years<SEP>1
i absolutely loved this movie when i was a kid i cried every time i watched it it wasnt weird to me i totally identified with the characters i would love to see it again and hope i wont be disappointed! pufnstuf rocks!!!! i was really drawn in to the fantasy world and to me the movie was loooong i wonder if i ever saw the series and have confused them the acting i thought was strong i loved jack wilde he was so dreamy to an 10 year old when i first saw the movie not in 1970 i can still remember the characters vividly the flute was totally believable and i can still feel the evil woods witchy poo was scary - i wouldnt want to cross her path<SEP>1
canadian filmmaker mary harron is a cultural gadfly whose previous films laid bare some the artistic excess of the sixties and the hollow avaricious eighties with the notorious bettie page she points her unswerving eye at fifties america an era cloaked in the moral righteousness of joe mccarthy while experiencing the beginnings of a sexual awakening that would result in the free love of the next decade harron and her co-writer guinevere turner are clearly not interested in the standard biopic of a sex symbol this is a film about the underground icon of an era and how her pure unashamed sexuality revealed both the predatory instincts and impure thoughts of a culture untouched by the beauty of a nude body if the details of betties life were all the film was concerned about then why end it before her most tragic period was about to begin clearly harron is more interested in americas attitudes towards sexual imagery then and now together with a fearless lead performance by gretchen mol and the stunningly atmospheric cinematography of wmott hupfel iii she accomplishes this goal admirably holding up a mirror to the past while making the audience examine their own enlightened 21st century attitudes towards so-called pornography as america suffocates under a new conservatism this is a film needed more than ever<SEP>1
the film begins with promise but lingers too long in a sepia world of distance and alienation we are left hanging but with nothing much else save languid shots of grave and pensive male faces to savour certainly no rope up the wall to help us climb over its a shame because the concept is not without meritwe are left wondering why a loving couple - a father and son no less - should be so estranged from the real world that their own world is preferable when claustrophobic beyond all imagining this loss of presence in the real world is rather too obviously and unnecessarily contrasted with the son having enlisted in the armed forces why not the circus so we can at least appreciate some colour we are left with a gnawing sense of loss but sadly no enlightenment which is bewildering given the film is apparently about some form of attainment not available to us all<SEP>0
this film is an excellent military movie it may not be an excellent hollywood movie but that does not matter hollywood has a reputation of sacrificing accuracy for good entertainment but that is not the case with this movie other reviewers have found this movie to be too slow for their taste but  as a retired soldier  i appreciate the pace the movie crew deliberately took to tell their story as completely as possible given the two hours and nine minutes allotted the story itself has been told and retold several times over but it remains for a professional soldier  and an african american at that  to report on the story as presented by the movie crew and as it presents the us navy to the world the story of brashears work to become a navy diver and his life as a navy diver beyond his graduation is not the only story that is presented there i also the story of how master chief petty officer sunday defied the illegal order of his commanding officer that petty officer 2nd class brashear not be passed in his test dive no matter how well he did and paid the price of a loss of one stripe and a change of assignment it also told the true story how brashear found the third hydrogen bombs lost in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain in the 1950s and how he saved the life of another seaman who was in the line of the snapped running line that would have snapped him in two if brashear had not shoved him out of the way and took the shot himself this was a complex story that was worth telling and i will admit that two hours and nine minutes was not enough to tell the full story and i can tell from the deleted scenes on the dvd that the crew tried their best to tell a story as full as possible as a professional soldier i was proud to see such a great story told in such a comprehensive manner and to see the traditions and honor of the navy preserved in such a natural and full manner<SEP>1
really its a dreadful cheat of a film its 70-minute running time is very well padded with stock footage the rest are non descript exteriors and drab interiors scenes the plot exposition is very poorly rendered they are all just perfunctory scenes sort of strung together there is no attempt at drama in scene selection but rather drama is communicated by the intensity of the actors please dont askthe plot concerns a rocket radiating a million degree heat orbiting earth five miles up threatening to destroy the earth its a real time menace that must be diverted if a custom built h-bomb can be fashioned and placed in an experimental rocket within an hour nothing very much here to report except for a mad speech by a scientist against the project because there might be some sort of life aboard and think of the scientific possibilities but this speech made by the obligatory idiot liberal was pretty much passé by thenwhat saves this film somewhat uniquely is the stock footage ive never seen a larger selection of fifties jet fighter aircraft in any other film this is by no means a complete list but just some of the aircraft i managed to see theres a brief interception by a pilot flying in alternate shots an f-89 scorpion and an f-86 first to scramble interceptors is the royal canadian air force in hawker hunters and f-86 sabre jets or canadian built cf-13s and even a pair of cf-100 clunksthen for some reason there are b-52s b-47s and even b36s are seen taking off more paddingthese canadian jets are moving at 1200 miles an hour i dont think so since one of them appears to be a ww2 era gloster meteor the rest f-80s the meteors press the attack and one turns into a late f-84f with a flight of early straight wing f-84s attacking in formationtheres a strange tandem cockpit version of the f-80 that doesnt seem to be the t-33 training type but some sort of interim all-weather interceptor variant with radar in the nose these are scrambled in a snowstorman angled deck aircraft carrier is seen from about 500 meters it launches f-8u crusaders f-11f tigers a-5 vigilantes and a-3 skywarriors the air force scrambles f-86s and f-84s and more f-89s then youve ever seen in your life as well as f-100 super sabres and f-102 delta daggersthe f-100s press their attack with sooooo much padding the f-89s unload their rockets in their wingtip pods in slo mo the f-86s fire an f-102 lets loose a falcon even some f-80s f-94s with mid-wing rocket pods let loose there is a very strange shot of a late model f-84 prototype with a straight wing early model f-85 above it in a turn obviously a manufacturers republic aviation advertising film showing the differences between the old and the new improved models of the f-84 thunderjet how it strayed into here is anybodies guessthere is other great stock footage of ottawa in the old days when the capital of canada was a wide spot in the road and especially wonderful footage of new york citys times square during one of the civil defense drills in the early 50s i think we also have to deal with the notion that this was filmed in canada with the possible exception of the auto chase seen late in the picture as the pacific seems to be in the background the use of a jowett jupiter is somewhat mind-boggling and there is a nice tr 3 to be seen also canada must have been cheap and it is rather gratuitously used a lot in the backgroundas far as the actual narrative of the film there is little to recommend it other than the mystery of just who ellen parker is giving the finger to at the end of the picture and she most definitely is flipping someone off could it be r as in robert loggia the director who dies before this film was released her career as this was her last creditits like the newspaper the gift came wrapped in was more valuable than the gift<SEP>0
the beginning of this movie is excellent with tremendous sound and some nice humor but once the film changes into animation it quickly loses its appealone of the reasons that was so at least for me was that the colors in much of the animation are too muted with too little contrast it doesnt look good at least on vhs once in a while it breaks out and looks great but not often also the characters come and go too quickly for example i would have liked to have seen more of moby dick when the film starts to drag however it picks up again with the entrance of the dragon and then the film finishes strong overall just not memorable enough or able to compete with the great animated films of the last dozen years<SEP>0
i was quite a fan of the series as a child and after that it has always remained in my mind as one of those memorable cartoons that made a difference in the early 80s compared to previous animated series heidi barbapapa il etait une fois lhomme most of which i love i find that other similar japanese cartoons of this kind released later cant match mazinger z as they started to boringly repeat the same patternthat very thing the novelty may be one of the best features of mazinger z another good point is its inventiveness with so many extravagant monsters strange devices and bizarre characters; actually we were eager to see each new installment to find out what kind of new fiend or evil machine was awaiting us!<SEP>1
this 1986 italian-french remake of the 1946 film of the same name turns up the heat early and doesnt let us come up for air the story is about a high-school student federico pitzalis who cant keep his eyes off the mysteriously beautiful young woman played by dutch phenom maruschka detmers who lives next door to the school one day he follows her and his persistence pays off theres only one problem: shes engaged to a sketchy character riccardo de torrebruna who may or may not have committed a heinous crime and if he repents will probably be let off with a slap on the wrist also the young woman is a little funny in the head and this is corroborated when we discover she has been seeing the boys father who is a psychiatrist giulias emotional instability is only equalled by her prodigious sexual desires hot hot hot from the word go with handsome leads and a bombshell performance from detmers who plays us like a yo-yo as she does the boy from scene to scene with enough suspense to keep us guessing right up until--and even after--the end available in r and x ! rated versions<SEP>1
i just rented this todayheard lots of good reviews beforehand wow!! what a pile of steaming poo this movie is!! does anyone know the address of the director so i can get my five dollars back finally someone bumped stop-loss from the worst iraq war movie ever number one spot to be fair i dont think there are any good iraq war movies anyway but this was really bad i wont get into any technical inaccuracies theres a hundred reviews from other gwot vets that detail them all if the director bothered to consult even the lowliest e-nothing about technical accuracy however they couldve made the movie somewhat realisticmaybe i guess the writer should be given the credit for this waste of a film he or she obviously hatched the plot for this movie from some vivid imagination not afflicted with the restraints of reality does anybody but me wonder what the point of this movie was was there a message seriously thoughwtfim pretty amazed at all the positive reviews really this film is hard to watch as a vet because of all the glaring inaccuracies but even if one could overlook that the plot sucks characters are shallow to say the least and the acting is poor at best its ironic i suppose that this movie is supposed to be about explosive ordinance disposal because its the biggest bomb ive seen this year<SEP>0
i was looking forward to this ride and was horribly disappointedand i am very easily amused at roller coaster and amusement park ridesthe roller coaster part was just okay - and that was all of about 30 seconds of a 90 second ride it was visually dull and poorly executed it was trying desperately to be like a mixture of the far superior indiana jones and space mountain rides and disneyland and failed in every aspectit was not thrilling or exciting in the least<SEP>0
vonneguts words are best experienced on paper the tales he weaves are gossemar silken strands of words and expressions that are not easily translated into a world of marilyn manson or jerry bruckheimer explosions his words have been treated well once before in the remarkable slaughterhouse-5mother night is probably one of the three novels vonnegut has written i could take to a desert island along with slaughterhouse-5 and bluebeardthe film version deserves a 10 but the books are so permanently part of my interior landscape that i just cant do itsome of the scenes left out of the film are part of my memory<SEP>1
arguably this is a very good sequel better than the first live action film 101 dalmatians it has good dogs good actors good jokes and all right slapstick! cruella devil who has had some rather major therapy is now a lover of dogs and very kind to them many including chloe simon owner of one of the dogs that cruella once tried to kill do not believe this others like kevin shepherd owner of 2nd chance dog shelter believe that she has changed meanwhile dipstick with his mate have given birth to three cute dalmatian puppies! little dipper domino and oddballstarring eric idle as waddlesworth the hilarious macaw glenn close as cruella herself and gerard depardieu as le pelt another baddie the name should give a clue this is a good family film with excitement and lots more!! one downfall of this film is that is has a lot of painful slapstick but not quite as excessive as the last film this is also funnier than the last filmenjoy 102 dalmatians! :-<SEP>1
this movie was horriblethey didnt develop any of the characters at all and the storyline was played out horribly it was a definite sleeper youd expect the action scenes on a movie like this to be its strong points but d-wars surprises you with even a let down in that department also the acting was just a step above the level of a low budget porno flick and i seriously mean thati was actually happy to see the end credits on this one cause it was just that bad!!! please whatever you do people dont waste your time and money on a crappy movie like d-wars<SEP>0
the fact that this movie has been entitled to the most successful movie in switzerlands film history makes me shake my head! its true but pitiful at the same time a flick about the swiss army could be a good deal betterthe story sounds interesting at the beginning: antonio carrera michael koch gets forced to absolve his military training by the army while he is in the church wedding his love laura moretti mia aegerterthe acting in some way doesnt really differ from just a few recruits getting drunk and stoned in the reality melanie winiger plays her role as the strong michelle bluntschi mediocre personally i found her rather annoying the storyline contains a comedy combined with a romance which does not work as expected the romance-part is too trashy and the comedy-part is not funny at all its just a cheap try and does not change throughout the whole movie whatsoever its funny for preadolescent 12-13 year olds but not for such as those who search an entertaining comedy the humor is weak except for some shotsdope cool! stealing cool! if you want a proper comedy about the swiss rs make sure you did not absolve your military training yet and even then dont expect too much!ill give it 4 out of 10 stars because marco rima is quite funny during his screen time not a hell of a lot screen time though<SEP>0
i saw this movie for a number of reasons the main being mira sorvino with her on the cast it couldnt be so bad and it even seemed like it had some mystery and olivier martinez was her boyfriend at the time and he was pretty good in `unfaithful the story is set in spain so it could be an exotic entertaining movie with one of my favorite actressesif youre thinking about the same thing let me warn you: this is a truly awful uninteresting boring movie the only adjective that comes to mind is patheticthe story is contrived with sub-plots that add nothing to the narrative they try to build a slasherthriller with a look at fascism in spain but fail horribly the twists have no credibility and the so-called investigation leads nowherethe characters are paper-thin! i didnt care about anyone more than that theyre irritating and pretty hateful peoplethe acting is atrocious mira what is wrong with you why mira youre an oscar winner! keep some dignity! her character was weak but that is no excuse for such an awful performance she seems to be sleepwalking all movie long come to think of it i actually think i saw her eyes slowly closing in some scenes i used to think this woman was sexy well she isnt here if you want to look at some skin try romi and michelle because theres nothing to see here and that accent my godolivier martinez is even worst its too painful to remember his performance to describe it here im sorry but i can´t ive suffered enough with this garbagethis whole movie is depressing! its so bad in every way its a wonder how it was even made a lousy team to produce a lousy script and make some money over the actors name dont fall for itavoid it!<SEP>0
this movie is great mind you - but only in the way it tells a very bad story stella is so terribly crude and never learns better her husband is incredibly snobby and small-minded neither ever learns better is this realistic somehow stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy manners & dress yet cannot understand that she just needs to tone it all down i dont think so stella is a good woman and a very good mother giving up herself so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snobs is disgusting much of what we see might have been normal for the times - people having a beer or two enjoying a player piano dancing - but it is made out to be some sort of moral inferiority i cant have our child living this way! spare me this story tells me one thing: that the unwashed working class cannot ever hope to aspire to the heights of the upper classes and that is simply a load of hogwash<SEP>0
in cold blood is masterfully directed and adapted by richard brooks however its also so bent on being realistic its sometimes more clinical than entertaining recounting the brutal killing of a midwest family author truman capote focused on minutia wrapping himself and the reader up in the subject and subjects! brooks departs wildly from that approach in favor of something closer to docudrama although he films on actual locations he keeps his distance the murderers are portrayed as depraved imbeciles which surely they were theyre not seen as misunderstood souls as in the capote book and the savagery of their act is horrifyingly blunt scott wilson and robert blake are excellent as the killers as is the supporting cast including john forsythe and paul stewart as the reporter the capote character the landmark photography is by the great conrad hall<SEP>1
i love this movie director michael powell once stated that this was his favorite movie and it is mine as well powell and pressburger created a seemingly simple superbly crafted story - the power of love against the powers that be however its deception lies in the complexity of its is it real or is it imaginary premise basically one could argue that it is simply a depiction of the effects of war on a young poetically inclined airman during wwii or is it the question is never answered one way or the other actually it is never even asked this continuous understatement is part of the films appealthe innovative photography and cinematography even includes some nice touches portraying the interests of the filmmakers for instance pressburger always wanted to do a cinematic version of richard strauss opera der rosenkavalier about a young 18th century viennese aristocrat this is evident in the brief interlude in which conductor 71 dressed in all his finery holds the rose which appears silver in heaven the music even has a dreamy qualityall of the acting is first rate - david niven is at his most charming and he has excellent support from veteran roger livesey and relative newcomer kim hunter but in my opinion the films charm comes from marius goring as conductor 71 he by far has the most interesting role filling each of his scenes with his innocent lightheartedness brightening the film its a pity that some of conductor 71s scenes were left on the cutting room floor it is also a pity that gorings comedic talents are rarely seen again on film except in the wonderful videos of the scarlet pimpernel television series from the 1950s this is by far and away the most memorable role of his film career he is a perfect foil for relaxed style of niven and his virtual overstatement contrasts so nicely with the seriousness of the rest of the characters ironically also in the mid -1940s niven also starred against another heavenly messenger played by cary grant in the bishops wife their acting styles were so similar that i found the result boring unenergetic and disappointing as a note according to powell goring desperately wanted the role of peter carter initially refusing conductor 71 its a good thing he gave in and gave us such a delightful portrayalthe movie commissioned to smooth over the strained relations between britain and the us overdrives its point towards the end but it is disarming in its gentle reminders of the horrors of war - the numerous casualties both military and civilian the need to go on when faced with death there is a conspicuous lack of wwii enemies in heaven but the civilians shown are of indeterminate origin powell and pressburger could have been more explicit in their depiction but it wasnt necessary the movie may not have served its diplomatic purpose as was hoped for but its originality continues to inspire moviemakers and viewers alike on both sides of the atlantic<SEP>1
the first of the tarzan movies staring johnny weissmuller the plot has already been summarized so i wont go into it again just know that the actors who play jane and tarzan were born for the role if you have not seen this film and you only have the modern day tarzan films as a referenceyou are missing a real treat doesnt matter how far weve come in movie making makeup set designsno one will ever play tarzan as well as johnny weissmuller did he was and is tarzan<SEP>1

as the godfather saga was the view of the mafia from the executive suite this series is a complex tale of the mafia from the working mans point of view if youve never watched this show youre in for an extended treat yes there is violence and nudity but it is never gratuitous and is needed to contrast tony soprano the thinking mans gangster with the reality of the life he has been born to and quite frankly would not ever have left even knowing how so many of his associates have ended up tony soprano can discuss sun tzu with his therapist then beat a man to death with a frying pan in a fit of rage and while dismembering and disposing of the body with his nephew take a break sit down and watch tv while eating peanut butter out of the jar and give that nephew advice on his upcoming marriage like they had just finished a sunday afternoon of viewing nfl football even carmella his wife when given a chance for a way out finds that she really prefers life with tony and the perks that go with it and looking the other way at his indiscretions versus life on her own if you followed the whole thing you know how it ends if you didnt trust me youve never seen a tv show end like this<SEP>1
this movie has it all it is a classic depiction of the events that surrounded the migration of thousands of cuban refugees antonio montanaplayed by al pacino is just one of the thousands to get a chance to choose his destiny in america this cinematic yet extremely accurate depiction of miamis drug empire is astonishing brian depalma does an amazing job directing this picture so much that the viewer becomes involved with both the storyline as well as every character in the cast with tonys characters pressence being so believable and strong brian depalma brang out the raw talent exposed by steven bauermanny tonys best friend mary elizabeth mastantoniogina tonys sister robert loggiafrank tonys bossand michelle pfeifferelvira franks wife i enjoyed every minute watching this movie and still watch it on a weekly basis on this year the 20th anniversary of this classic crime movie i for one am a true believer that in another 20 years people will still refer to this movie in astonishing numbers with other crime movies being so dramatic i find this movie is a shock to the system<SEP>1
thats what my friend brian said about this movie after about an hour of it he wasnt able to keep from dozing off i had been ranting about how execrable it was and finally i relented and played it having run out of adjectives for boring imagine if you will the pinnacle of hack-work something so uninspired so impossibly dreadful that all you want to do after viewing it is sit alone in the dark and not speak to anybody some people labor under the illusion that this movie is watchable it is not not under any form of narcotic or brain damage i would only recommend this to someone in order to help them understand how truly unbearable it is dont believe me gather round granted as a nation we in america dont always portray middle eastern peoples in a tasteful manner but how about a kid in a sheik outfit bowing in salaam-fashion to a stack of castrol motor oil bottles youll find that here get it the arab worships oil i couldnt believe what i was seeing having the kid fly planes into a skyscraper wouldve been more appropriate who in their right mind would think that was a funny joke its not even close to cleverly offensive it just sucks and makes you want to punch whomever got paid to write that bit in the face in the middle of the film a five-man singing group called the landmines takes the stage at an officers ball okay- are you ready the joke is they sing terribly and off-key why did i write that in caps also because the joke is pound pound pounded into your head with a marathon of horrendous sight gags they start off mediocre enough; glasses cracking punch tumblers shattering then there is i am 100% serious a two-frame stop-motion sequence of a womans shoes coming off you read that correctly- the music was so bad in one frame the womans feet have shoes on in the very next- the shoes are off!!! get it because the music was so bad her shoes came off! what the f then there is an endless montage of stock footage to drive home the point that the singing is bad if any human being actually suffered through this scene in the theater without running like hell i would be astonished this movie is honestly like a practical joke to see how fast people would bolt out the doors robert downey sr directs comedy the way his son commands respect by staying drug-free badly other things to watch out for:1 the popular music shoehorned in wherever possible every time liceman appears a really inappropriate iggy pop song plays plus all the actors do their best to act like it got really chilly for some reason2 barbara bachs criminally awful accent she sounds like shes trying to talk like a baby while rolling a marble around on her tongue there is no nudity and there are several scenes where the boys all moan and writhe from a glimpse of her cleavage like theyre in a community school acting class and theyve been directed to act like aroused retarded people 3 liceman feeds his revolting dog a condom remember; when this movie came out throwing in abortion and condom was seen as edgy 4 tom poston plays a mincing boy-hungry pedophile back when hollywood thought pedophile and homosexual were one in the same flat-out embarrassing 5 watch the ending nothing is wrong with your vcr that is actually the ending tell me that doesnt make you want to explode everyone whos ever made any movie ever watch this at your own risk up the academy has been known to actually make other movies like the jerk or blazing saddles less funny simply by placing the videotape near them<SEP>0
its hard to believe that this is a sequel to henry fool hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both movies while henry fool is refreshing witty comical fay grim is slow boring and doesnt go anywhere where has the wit gone i am baffledit is 10 years since i saw henry fool and many of its dialogs and scenes are still vivid in my memory fay grim is painful to watch this is no fault of the actors who are good parker posey or great jeff goldblum -- the blame lies entirely with the plot the dialog and even some of the filming low budget is no excuse a huge disappointment sorry i couldnt pay attention to the plot i was so bored so disappointed if you enjoyed this one you might not enjoy henry fool so much the two movies have absolutely nothing to do with each other there is no continuity in the characters personalities its all a fraud to entice fans of henry fool to watch the sequelim switching this off now -- henry in some sort of jail with a taliban!!<SEP>0
from beginning to end this is the most emotionally overwrought movie about nothing i have ever seen the characterizations and interactions between the title character and marthe kllers character are pure torture the racetrack as metaphor gimmick is so overplayed that it borders on cliche yet director pollack treats every hairpin turn as if it were something profoundly importantmaybe theres some value for a msft3000 re-playing of some of the scenes such as pacino getting in touch with his inner female for goof value but even such accidental humor is hard to find in this total turkey<SEP>0
the angry red planet quickie review like the man from planet x this is a bizarre science fiction tale culled from an era where fantasy and science fiction were still damn near the same thing meaning we have some highly laughable special effects and rampant pseudo-science masquerading as science fiction and yes its another classic released in a high quality transfer with a crisp picture and sharp sound--by midnite moviesso the main reason to watch this film oh its definitely the whole time our space crew is on mars what you thought angry red planet referred to neptune prior to that is some rather poor quality space crew boarding a space ship inside of which they smoke and toss around sexist chauvinistic banter aimed at the puny female member of the crew itd be somewhat offensive by todays standards if it werent so damn funny but mars is the real reason were watching this thing the film is generally black and white but mars well mars is screaming bloody red its filmed in this bizarre red plasticy sheen giving the angry red planet quite an interesting look of overexposed redness its really quite a sightas are the ha ha aliens viewers are to witness the best being the ratbatspidercrab you think thats a joke thats what they call it in the movie! its a gigantic chimera small puppet of a thing combining traits of rats bats spiders and crabs it bounds along all puppety and scares the sh*t out of our heroic crew there are other weird and poorly imagined aliens to be seen but that one takes the cake eventually after their harrowing experience on mars the sexist crew boards their ship and returns to whatever planet it was they came fromthis aint for everyone science fiction film buffs & curiosity seekers and some general film buffs fans of mystery science theater 3000 will have a field day with this one if they never got to it on the show210 modern score 610 nostalgia score 410 overallwwwresidenthazardcom<SEP>0

iam a big fan of mr ram gopal varma but i could not believe that he made this movie i was really disappointedram gopal varma ki aag doesnt come anywhere close to the real sholay it does not leave a lasting impression on a viewer ram gopal varma fails to create chemistry between the characters there is no camaraderie between heeroajay devgan and rajprashant raj there are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together the sequence outside the courtroom with amitabh bachchan and mohanlal face off is remarkable amitabh bachchan should not have done this movie ajay and sushmita sen was trying their best but no use rajpal yadavs voice modulation - ineffective and rather pointless mohanlal did full justice and proved it again that acting is all about facial expression and body language rest of the cast was below expectation the comedy situation which was adapted from the original sholay fall flat in this movieram gopal varma could have worked upon the script but because of the controversies surrounded against the movie he messed up and just for the sake of making he made this aag but there is no fire<SEP>0
theres something wonderful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be head and shoulders above every tarzan movie that followed it including the bloated and boring 1980s piece greystoke once the viewer gets past the first three scenes which are admittedly dull tarzan and his mate takes off like a shot offering non-stop action humor and romance maureen osullivan is charming and beautiful as jane and walks off with the movie weismuller is solid as well highly recommended<SEP>1
the tv guide calls this movie a mystery what is a mystery to me is how is it possible that a culture that can produce such intricate and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians cannot produce a single film that would rise above the despicable trash level this film so perfectly represents this is bollywood at its bestworst i honestly cannot tell the difference nauseatingly sweet kitschy clichés on every level story-line situations dialog music and choreography to put it bluntly you must be a retard to enjoy it i watched it to satisfy my cultural curiosity but there were times when i had to walk away from it because i could not take it any more the only redeeming quality of the movie is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses<SEP>0
really excellent movie one of the best ive seen touching and simple - just like life sometimes you cry sometimes you laugh and its just beautiful not too much of anything just as its suppose to be really loved the idea of the movie noone is bad or good all or just people sometimes make mistakes mostly because of societys pressure everyone tries to stay strong and some succeed more than others and the most important thing is that you dont have reasons to get angry - you can do it but eventually the anger goes away and then you to need to let love come back in although its hard there lies the true happinessgreat actors and cast the movie really gets you into the feeling of the movienice nice nicei recommend to see it especially if you like to see italians life<SEP>1
if you want scream or anything like the big-studio horror product that we get forced on us these days dont bother this well-written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense how children interpret the world and the violence in it our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends all here but not flatly on the surface you could technically call it a monster movie even though the wendigo does not take physical form until the end and then its even up to you and your beliefs as to whats happening with the legendary spiritbeast some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores though in fact the less you see of the creature the better fessenden successfully continues george romeros tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out<SEP>1
this movie awed me so much that i watch it at least once a year at times i find it uncomfortable at times i find it empowering and i always find the characters human and real it is a movie that shows you the gritty reality of life in la starting with the recurring helicopter search lights scanning for the dangers lurking so close to the ordinary lives being carried on by the characters it is also a movie that shows you how the kindness of a stranger can change your life and empower you to make a difference grand canyon reminds you that every action you take whether intended or not has powerful repercussions i found this movie to be similar in many ways to robert altmans film short cuts both had a star-studded roster of perfectly cast actors & actresses and both movies allowed you to gradually see how the the characters interrelated with one another and affected each other for better or worse grand canyon did a better job of providing a cohesive message hope in the face of despairing reality than altmans film although i found them both intriguing in their own way this film is a definite must see!!!<SEP>1
a friend clearly with no taste or class suggested i take a look at the work of ron atkins if this is representative of his oeuvre i never want to see anything else by him it is amateurish self-indulgent criminally shoddy and self-indulgent rubbish the whore mangler of the title is an angry low budget filmmaker who murders a bunch of hookers there is a little nudity and some erections but no single element could possibly save this from the hangmans noose the lighting is appalling the dialog is puerile and mostly shouted and the direction is clueless i saw a doco on american exploitation filmmakers during the recent fangoria convention atkins was one of those featured he spoke like there was something important about his work but after a viewing of this i see nothing of any import whatsoever there is no style either and the horrible video effects like solarization only enhance the amateurishness not even so bad its fun avoid<SEP>0
first of all for this movie i just have one word: wow this is probably one of the best movies that touched me from its story to its performances so wonderfully played by sophia loren and marcello mastroianni i was very impressed with this last one because he really brought depth to the character as it was a very hard role still the two of them formed a pair that surprised me from the beginning until the end showing in the way a friendship filled with love that develops during the entire day settled in the movie the story takes some time to roll as the introduction of the characters is long but finally we are compensated with a wonderful tale about love and humanity if you have the chance see it because its a movie that will stay in your mind for many time simply amazing - 910<SEP>1
i felt rancid aluminium was a complete waste of two hours the plot line was thin and confusing the prestigious line up of players had some terrible dialogue and extremely questionable accents the camera work was somewhat experimental in places and although it could be seen what the director was trying to convey it just made it even more difficult to watch one of the most annoying aspects of rancid aluminium is the over use of narration throughout the film almost like the entire plot is being dictated to the audience the best performances werent anything to do with acting in fact probably the most convincing performance came from dani behr of all people although admittedly does play the stereotypical office secretary do not under any circumstance go and see this movie unless you need a reason to catch up on some lost sleep there are certainly better ways to spend your hard earned cash<SEP>0
live feed is set in some unnamed chinesejapanese asian district somewhere as five american friends sarah ashley schappert emily taayla markell linda caroline chojnacki mike lee tichon & darren rob scattergood are enjoying a night on the town & taking in the sights after a scuffle in a bar with a japanese triad boss stephen chang they decide to check out a porno theatre as you would inside they are separated & quickly find out that the place belongs to the triad boss who uses it to torture & kill people for reasons which arent made clear can local boy miles kevan ohtsji save themthis canadian production was co-written produced & directed by ryan nicholson who also gets a prosthetic effects designer credit as well one has to say that live feed is another pretty poor low budget shot on a camcorder type horror film that seems to exist only to cash in on the notoriety & success of hostel 2005 & the mini craze for torture porn as its become known according the imdbs trivia section for live feed writer & director nicholson wrote it after hearing about certain activities taking place in live sex theatres for my money i reckon he wrote it after watching hostel! the script is pretty poor there is no basic reason given as to why this porno theatre has a big fat ugly freak dressed in bondage gear lurking around torturing & killing people none was it for the triads was it for his pleasure was it to make snuff films to sell some sort of explanation would have been nice also why did he turn on the triad boss at the end if your looking for a film with a coherent story then forget about live feed it seemed to me to be some sort of uneasy misjudged mix of sex s&m horror torture gore & action films which doesnt come off i mean just setting a horror film in a porn theatre isnt automatically going to make your film any good there still needs to be a decent script & story right the characters were fairly poor clichés & some of their actions & motivations were more than a little bit questionable it moves along at a reasonable pace its fairly sleazy mixing gore sex & nudity but it does look cheap which lessens the effectdirector nicholson doesnt do anything special here the editing is choppy & annoying he seems to think lighting almost every scene with neon lights is a good idea & the film has a cheap look about it available in both r & unrated versions i saw the shorter cut r version which really isnt that gory but i am prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to the unrated version & say that it might be much much gorier but i cant say for sure theres a fair amount of nudity too if thats your thing i wouldnt say theres much of an atmosphere or many scares here because there isnt & arent respectively although it does have a sleazy tone in general which is something it has going for it i supposetechnically live feed isnt terribly impressive the blood looks a little too watery for my liking & entire scenes bathed in annoying neon lights sometimes makes it hard to tell whats happening it to often looks like it was shot on a hand-held camcorder & the choppy editing at least on the r rated version is at times an annoying mess shot on location in an actual porn theatre somewhere in vancouver in canada the acting is poor sometimes i couldnt tell if the actresses in this were supposed to be crying or laughinglive feed is not a film i would recommend anyone to rush out & buy or rent i didnt think much of it with its very weak predictable storyline lacking exposition & which goes nowhere poor acting & less than impressive gore at least in the r rated cut anyway watch either hostel films again or instead as they are superior<SEP>0
a wonderful movie! anyone growing up in an italian family will definitely see themselves in these characters a good family movie with sadness humor and very good acting from all you will enjoy this movie!! we need more like it<SEP>1
this is not a good movie too preachy in parts and the story line was sub par the 3d was ok but not superb i almost fell asleep in this moviethe story is about 3 young flies that want to have adventure and follow up on it the characters are lacking i truly do not care about these characters and feel that there was nothing to keep an adult interested pixar this is noti would have liked to see more special 3d effects also i wold like to see more fly jokes than the mom constantly saying lord of the flies pretty sexist in showing the women as house wives and fainting<SEP>0
if youve ever seen an eighties slasher there isnt much reason to see this one originality often isnt one of slasher cinemas strongpoints and its something that this film is seriously lacking in there really isnt much that can said about pranks so ill make this quick the film was one of the 74 films included on the dpp video nasty list and that was my only reason for seeing it the plot follows a bunch of kids that stay behind in a dorm at christmas time as theyre in a slasher someone decides to start picking them off and this leads to one of the dullest mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie the fact that this movie was on the video nasty list is bizarre because despite a few gory scenes this film is hardly going to corrupt or deprave anyone and gorier slashers than this friday the 13th for example didnt end up banned but then again theres banned films that are much less gory than this one the witch who came from the sea for example anyway the conclusion of the movie is the best thing about it as although the audience really couldnt care less who the assailant is by this point; it is rather well done on the whole this is a dreary and dismal slasher that even slasher fans will do well to miss<SEP>0

diego armando maradona was and still remains as the best football player the game has offered not just an athlete but an artist this documetary if the 1986 world cup will forever live in the memories of every football fan around the world because of his tremendous and unbelievable goal which he scored against my own countryengland theres absolutely no point of diminishing this star although i dont undersand spanish i can appreciate the argentine narrator he actually cries of happiness and can barely express his emotion anything i wrote can be senseless and difficult to comprehend but readersyou have to watch this to know what i mean<SEP>1
this is not a profound movie; most of the plot aspects are pretty predictable and tried and true but it was well-acted and made some interesting points about what we might regret our mistakes as the movie calls them as we look back over our lives i had not read the book so didnt know much other than it was the story of a dying woman who has strong memories from long ago that she hasnt really shared with anyone thankfully they got a top-notch castmerylstreeps daughter mamie gummer plays the young lila and then meryl shows up at the end of the film as the old lilain addition to an amazing resemblance duh! the younger actress did a great job perhaps not quite up to her moms caliber but who is all others in this film were fine although i wish there had been more of glen close and thought the buddy character was alittle too dramatic this is more of a girls movie than for the guys but a good one to see with your mom or your daughter and maybe start some dialog going how hard it is to really know a parent as a person!<SEP>1
the original les visiteurs was original hilarious interesting balanced and near perfect lv2 must be a candidate for worst first sequel to a really good film in lv2 everyone keeps shouting when a gag doesnt work first its repeated another 5 times with some vague hope that it will eventually become funny lv2 is a horrible parody of lv1 except of course that a parody should be inventive if you loved lv1 just dont see this film just see lv1 again!!<SEP>0
often laugh out loud sometimes sad story of 2 working divorced guys -- lemmon a neurotic clean house husband and matthau a slob sportswriter -- who decide to live together to cut down on expenses nicely photographed and directed the script is very barbed -- that is theres always more than one side to almost every line particularly funny scene involves 2 british sisters evans and shelley who seem amused by everything anyone says but when lemmon busts out his photos of kids and yes ex-wife-to-be he has the girls sobbing along with him before matthau can show up with the promised drinks!very entertaining<SEP>1
from the filmmakers who brought us the march of the penguins i guess that came with plenty of expectations for the fox and the child from the harsh winters of the south pole to the lush wilderness in france the narrative now becomes part documentary and part fairy tale which tells of the friendship between the two titular characters renard the fox and its friendship with the child who christened it played by bertille noel-beuneauthe storys frankly quite simple and at times this movie would have looked like the many japanese movies which children-miscellaneous animals striking a friendship after the development of trust and how they go about hanging around each other dealing with respective adversaries and the likes here the child meets the elegant fox near her home up in the mountains which provide for plenty of beautiful picture-postcard perfect shots that a cinematographer will have to go into overdrive to capturebut while we indulge in wistful scenery the characters dont get to establish that level of trust from the onset and we have to wait a few seasons to past and 45 minutes into the film before they find a leveler in food the child persistently attempts at striking a bond with the objective of taming the creature for her own amusement but the fox well as other notions of course while i thought the narrative was pretty weak unlike march of the penguins which has that human narrative interpretation of whats happening on screen what excelled here were the documentary elements of the movie tracing the life and times of the fox as both a predator and a preybetween the two more tension and drama was given to the latter especially when dealing with traditional foes like wolves and granted those sequences were fairly intense especially when the child got embroiled in it otherwise it was plain sailing and quite a bore as the two of them go about their playing with each other in shots that you know have undergone some movie magic editing there were surprisingly dark moments in the movie that werent really quite suitable for children as those in the same hall attested to it by bawling their eyes out suddenly so parents you might want to take note and not let your toddler disturb the rest of the movie goersas a film i wouldve preferred this to be a complete documentary ala the march of the penguins but i guess the way it was resented probably had the objective of warning us not to meddle with nature and that some things are just not meant to be and should stay as such decent movie that leaned on the strength of the chemistry between bertille noel- bruneau and the multiple foxes that played renard<SEP>1
in 1958 clarksberg was a famous speed trap town much revenue was generated by the sheriffs department catching speeders the ones who tried to outrun the sheriff well that gave the sheriff a chance to push them off the clarksberg curve with his plymouth cruiser for example in the beginning of the movie a couple of servicemen on leave trying to get back to base on time are pushed off to their deaths if i recall correctly then one day a stranger drove into town possibly the coolest hot rodder in the world michael mccord even his name is a car name as in mccord gaskets in possibly the ultimate hot rod a black flamed 34 ford coupe the colors of death evil and hellfire he gets picked up for speeding by the sheriff on purpose he checks out the lay of the land he is the brother of one of the sheriffs victims he knows how his brother died the clarksberg government is all in favor of the sheriff theres only one way to get justice served for the killing of his brother and to fix things so this aint a-ever gonna happen again to anyone: recreate the chase and settle the contest hot-rodder style to the death he goes out to the curve and practices the sheriff knows mccord knows the race begins this is a movie to be remembered by anyone who ever tried to master maneuvering on a certain stretch of road<SEP>1
during the opening night of the vanties a woman is found dead on the catwalk above the stage as the show continues the police attempt to piece together who killed who and why before the final curtaini had always heard that this was a great classic comedy mystery so i was excited to find myself a copy unfortunately no one told me about the musical numbers which go on and on and on while the numbers certainly are the type that hollywood did in their glory days they become intrusive because they pretty much stop the movie dead despite attempts to weave action around them this wouldnt be so bad if the music was half way decent but its not there is only one good song worse its as if the studio knew they had one song cocktails for two and were forced to endure four versions of it: a duet a big production number as the vanities finale and in the background as incidental music i dont think spike jones and his city slickers ever played it that much the rest of the movie is pretty good with victor mclaglen sparring nicely with jack oakie charles middleton is very funny is his scenes as an actor in love with the wardrobe mistressby no mean essential i can recommend this if you think you can get through the musical numbers or are willing to scan through them its a fun movie of the sort they dont make any more<SEP>1
when i first saw this film i thought it was going to be a good sasquatch film usually when you have these types of movies theres generally one sasquatch but in this one there is like what 7 or 10 of them acting was good plot was ok i liked the scenes where the sasquatch is killing the first few victims very good camera work i was expecting it to be a gory film but it was very little this movie was way better than sasquatch the sci-fi channel really needs to make more sasquatch films i mean i really liked sasquatch mountain abominibal was not good the one im reviewing is ok but the movie sasquatch was not but im not reviewing that so let me get back on track this movie is good for a rainy saterday afternoon but for any other occasions no<SEP>0
greetings again from the darkness how rare it is for a film to examine the lost soul of men in pain adam sandler stars as charlie a man who lost his family in the 911 tragedy and has since lost his career his reason to live and arguably his sanity don cheadle co-stars as sandlers former dental school roommate who appears to have the perfect life that sandler apparently had prior to 911of course the parallels in these mens lives are obvious but it is actually refreshing to see mens feelings on display in a movie feelings other than lust and revenge that is watching how they actually help each other by just being there is painful and heartfelt writerdirector mike binder the upside of anger and sandlers accountant in this film really brings a different look and feel to the film some of the scenes dont work as well as others but overall it is well written and solidly directedsandler and cheadle are both excellent sandlers character reminds a bit of his fine performance in punch drunk love but here he brings much more depth cheadle is always fine and does a nice job of expressing the burden he carries just by watching him work a jigsaw puzzlesupport work is excellent by jada pinkett smith as cheadles wife liv tyler as a very patient psychiatrist saffron burrows in an oddly appealing role donald sutherland as an irritated judge and melinda dillon and robert klein as sandlers in-lawsthe film really touches on how the tragic events of that day affected one man so deeply that he is basically ruined in addition to the interesting story and some great shots of nyc you have to love any film that features vocals from chrissy hynde bruce springsteen and roger daltrey as well as eddie vedder impersonating daltrey not exactly a chipper upbeat film but it is a quality film with an unusual story<SEP>1
i have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film i even got the rental company to give me my money back because i argued that they perpetrated false advertisingits not enough that the movie itself is a pos but the cover art is what sold me ive done better make-up effects on my children at halloween than what the movie actually depicts versus the cover art can you say raccoon eyesim not going to waste more of my time by going into the full details but come on the movies main character is an la cop who was born and raised in alabama - but has a german accent!! its beyond insulting<SEP>0
emily watsons natalia is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character i have ever seen on a screen she is the queen of this film beyond all doubt or is she transmuted to the king the internecine weaving of the chess games and the families struggles for control power and victory is stunning just as the chess masters in the film do the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at once but all weave into either major or minor patterns the period the costumes and imagery of early 20th century italys lake district is captured magnificently not a single square of space is wastedso many brilliant scenes abound i cannot recount them all i recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice possibly a week apart because you cant possibly capture all the poetry within a 64-square yet multi-dimensional framework in one setting i did not read nabakovs book but to try an analogy of my own what i am reading reminds of me of another romantically triumphant poetry-as-game movie barry levinsons the natural it totally jettisoned the downbeat ending of bernard malamuds fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely american well the director did that one better by seamlessly meshing russian and italian morals and mores as a backdrop to enlightenment the true story here is that games are zero-sum; there is a winner and a loser unless both contestants draw but in life and especially in the context of our immortal souls we are only limited by those constraints and lifes conventions to the extent we let others break our spirit pure love as personified by emily watsons natalia can transcend and allow all of us to be enhanced by its gifts simultaneously only the barriers erected by our fears can cut us off from itthis is a magnificent movie 1010<SEP>1
star trek hidden frontier will surprise you in many ways first its a fan made series available only on the web and it features mainly friends & neighbors who have the computer programs and home video cameras and sewing machines to as mickey & judy once put it put on a show its definitely friends & neighbors to you can tell a lot of these people arent the most beautiful looking folks youve ever seen or the youngest or the thinnest some of them stumble through their lines like theyre walking on marbles some of them have thick accents or simply dont seem to speak well in the first place whick makes it virtually impossible to understand a single solitary word that theyre saying still you have to admit for everything these friends & neighbors have put together its actually fun to watch yes some of the dialogue is hokey yes its a little odd though admittedly a little cool too watching two starfleet males kiss although some of the kissing scenes seem to go on and on yes you cringe a bit when they clearly quote from st:tos tng other shows and the movies or when you hear the theme from galaxy quest played at the beginning and end of every show okay we can get by that why the graphics are first rate better than almost anything youve seen and sometimes a show or two really stands out story-wise some of them are actually real tear-jerkershidden frontier is a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the word but you have to give the people involved credit where credit is due it takes a lot of effort to put on a production of this magnitude people sets costumes graphics its a huge effort on a lot of peoples parts we watch we return and we thank them<SEP>1
every one should see this movie because each one of us is broken in some way and it may help us realize 1 my life isnt as bad as i thought it was and 2 how important it is to adopt a child in need there are so many out there to think that the movie was actually based on a real person made us think deep about life and how the world has and always will be corrupt but that corruption doesnt have to reach your home we all have a choice! definitely recommend this one and while youre at it id like to throw in the color purple and woman thou art loosed by td jakesthese are all movies that are based on life and give us a glimpse of life<SEP>1
i recently rented the animated version of the lord of the rings on video after seeing the fantastic 2001 live action version of the film the lord of the rings live action trilogy directed by peter jackson will undoubtably be far better than george lucas star wars prequel trilogy episodes 1-3 will ever be as the real fantasy film series of the 21st century!i remember seeing the animated version as a child and i didnt quite understand the depth of the film at that time now that i have read the books i understand what the whole storyline is all about to be sure some of the characters are quite silly samwise gangee is particularly annoying almost as much as jar jar binks in star wars episode one awful! but i have to say it follows the book rather closely and it goes into part of book two the two towers the good things are that the action is somewhat interesting and some of the animation is quite remarkable for its time the bad things are that it ends upruptly halfway through the two towers without any result of frodos quest to destroy the one ring and the animation looks quite dated compared to todays standards overall not as bad as many say it is but the 2001 live action version is the new hallmark of the lord of the rings! at least ralph bakshi took the script seriously! peter jackson has said that the animated version inspired him to read the books which in turn caused him to create one of the greatest fantasy series ever put on film so we can at least thank ralph bakshi for that matter! ill take the animated version of lord of the rings over the live version of harry potter anyday!a 7 out of a scale of 1-10 far less violent than the 2001 live action version but nowhere near as good! for diehard fans of the books and film versions of the lord of the rings<SEP>1
the perfect son is a story about two 30-something brothers one who is seemingly perfect and the other who is basically a screw-up frequently landing himself in drug rehab centers after the death of their father the two are brought together after a long absence and the usual sibling rivalry resurfaces it isnt until the perfect brother makes the startling revelation that he has aids that the irresponsible younger brother finally makes a move to get his life in order and take some responsibilitythe movie does a nice job of chronicling the younger brothers comeback though it may seem a bit far-fetched at times beating drug addiction is never so easy what makes the film more tender is the treatment of aids a topic that has become somewhat passe in cinema over the last 5-10 years and also the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two formerly feuding brothers is very believable and well-done the two main actors were both very competent if not terribly charismatica solid first feature effort from director and writer leonard farlinger whose own brother died of aids the ending is nicely done as well<SEP>1
its not well shot well written or well acted but it has to be the most addictive show ive seen since twin peaks every single revelation is timed so well that you have to see the next episode to get any kind of closure they have even slowed down the pace of the show where they only reveal tiny amounts of information per episode however it feels like theyve just told you everything you wanted to know however some of the acting is just about awful and some of the duologue is downright brutal some characters are very two dimensional the more experienced actors like locke and ecko really stand out over actors who play jack kate sayid and so on the development of the show can also be very frustrating as the following episode may not show what the previous episode lead up to annoying side plots have become part of the story that sometimes tell you nothing however the second season has developed to a point where back stories reveal more about the island than they had previously all in all its a great show but not perfect<SEP>1
this is the official sequel to the 92 sci-fi action thriller in the original van damme was among several dead vietnam war vets revived to be the perfect soldiers unisols in this one its i guess about a dozen years later since van damme has a daughter about that age now hes working with the government in a classified installation to train the latest unisols - codenamed unisol 2500 for some reason as usual something goes wrong: the on-site super-computer named seth - like the snake in king cobra the same year goes power-crazy takes command of the unisols and even downloads its computer brain into a new super-unisol body jai white were lookin at the next step in evolution folks! most of van dammes fights are with one particularly mean unisol pro wrestler goldberg who just keeps on comin: drop him off a building - no good; run him down with a truck - no go! shoot him burn him - forgetaboutit! much of the humor is traced to how van damme is now outmoded and out-classedhes even going grey around the edges but though he takes a lickin he keeps on kickin! most sequels of this sort are pretty lame - pale imitations of the originals and while this one is certainly no stroke of genius it manages to be consistently entertaining especially if youre a pro-wrestling fan<SEP>0
i read that jessie matthews was approached and turned down co-starring with fred astaire in damsel in distress jessie matthews in her prime never left her side of the pond to do any american musical films if they had teamed for this film it would have been a once in a lifetime eventits a pity because damsel in distress has everything else going for it fred astaire story and adapted to screen by author pg wodehouse burns&allen for comedy and songs by the gershwin brothers in answer to the question posed by the nice work if you can get it there isnt much you could ask more for this filmexcept a leading lady though ginger rogers made several films away from fred astaire damsel in distress is the only film astaire made without rogers while they were a team young joan fontaine was cast in this opposite astaireher character has none of the bite that ginger rogerss parts do in these films all she basically has to do is act sweet and demure she also doesnt contribute anything musically and if i had to rate all the dancing partners of fred astaire joan fontaine would come out at the bottom the poor woman is just horrible in the things are looking up number when she co-starred later on in a musical with bing crosby the emperor waltz its no accident that fontaine is given nothing musical to dothe version i have is a colorized one and in this case i think it actually did some good the idyllic lush green english countryside of pg wodehouse is really brought out in this vhs copy especially in that number i mentioned before with astaire and fontaine which does take place in the gardenburns&allen on the other hand as a couple of old vaudeville troopers complement astaire in grand style in the stiff upper lip number the surreal fun-house sequence is marvelously stagedpg wodehouses aristocracy runs the gamut with constance collier at her haughty best and for once montagu love as fontaines father as a nice man on filmthe biggest hit out of a damsel in distress is a foggy day maybe the best known song about the british capital city since london bridge is falling down done in the best simple elegant manner by fred astaire its one of those songs that will endure as long as london endures and even afteroverlooking the young and inexperienced joan fontaine a damsel in distress rates as a classic classic score classic dancing classic comedy who could ask for anything more<SEP>1
i loved the movie but like everyone said there were some bits that werent developed enough i thought personally that the girls were very vapid before they landed in prison; sure they were supposed to be innocent american girls but stilli felt like they lacked that bond that best friends are supposed to have for example in the montage where theyre sight-seeing the way they held each other for the photograph was very awkward-lookingthen there are some parts that were very ambiguous i think its pretty much understood that danes character didnt do it but i can see how that could be confusing also why did the camera dwell on manat bearing a very grim expression after he put the bags in their taxi trunk i thought it was suggesting something but it turned out to be nothingapart from that the movie was great i cried when claire danes took the blame; shes a great actressalso i wanted to see that bitchy thai inmate get her ass kicked talk about lack of closure<SEP>1
a mercilessly corny and painfully unfunny attempt to transplant the character of sheriff bart from mel brooks blazing saddles into his own weekly sitcom this is really as bad as some people say it is!the laugh-track only serves to remind the unamused viewer what all in this supposed comedy is intended to be a joke and just how desperate for laughs it really is!however it is somewhat interesting to see louis gossett jr trying his best to impersonate cleavon little his embarrassment shows through in every scene he was much funnier in the hbo movie el diablo than he was here in this slab of cheese!truly the best and funniest thing about black bart is the name of his horse!<SEP>0
i must say this movie has given me a dual personality ive been told again and again to shut up and start speaking like a normal person but its very hard no not the wang did you find that disgusting and disrespectful well get in the mood for a lot more this movie is just filthy! its not a film to show your grand-parents but you should show it to a teenager or some immature guy at your workplace anyway back to the voice mannerisms fortunately this site has some ladies man did anyone at the studio notice that theres supposed to be a apostrophe between the e and s so you can always have a fine little something to say to your boss or the cops i have a sheet in my wallet<SEP>1
meryl streep is such a genius well at least as an actress i know shes been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents but she nails the accent every time her performance as lindy chamberlain was inspiring mrs chamberlain as portrayed here was not particularly likable nor all that smart but that just makes streeps work all the more remarkable i think she is worth all 10 or so of her oscar nominations about the film well there were a couple of interesting things i dont know much about australia but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story i had largely missed this when i first saw the film some years ago but it came through loud and clear yesterday and it seems the australian press is just as accomplished at misery-inducing pursuit and overkill as their american colleagues a pretty good film a bit different grade: b<SEP>1
this is no doubt one of the worst movies i have ever seen this makes your run of the mill tv movie look like reservoir dogs based on a book by the one and only britney spears and her mother this is trash with nothing bar a reasonable performance from virginia madsen i hope you got paid well to save it the story of a red neck country gill who wins a scholarship in a prestigious music school is little but a vehicle to pedal ms spears pants music to the consumer and to generally agree that low brow must be the way there is nothing good going on here with all the beats as predictable as night following day never ever again<SEP>0
i showed this to my 6th grade class about 17 years ago and the students loved it i loved it too the story of the termites and their interaction with their environment is amazing the cast of creatures is deep and they all play their parts well the battle between the two cold-blooded titans is truly classic footagealan root has done some incredible camera work and this should have won the best documentary oscar the copy i have doesnt have orson welles narrating it derek jacobi and it isnt called the mysterious castles of clay just castles of clay this makes me think that it must have been done with welles added for star power and an oscar pushi was lucky enough to find this vhs just recently and it is now my childrens favorite movie they brought it to the latest family gathering instead of a disney movie if you can find this movie you are indeed lucky<SEP>1
do not see this movie if you value your mind at the end of our collective viewing me and my friends estimated that we each lost 5% of our brains during its course the only person involved with its making that was not clinically insane was the set designermost movies leave a bad taste in your mouth i realize now that instead of a feeling of revulsion this movie has bred a deep hatred within me i hate this movie so very very muchsome might say this movie is not meant to be taken seriously if only it didnt take itself seriously but it does the plot is a warmed over version of blade runner-esque universe melded with the cheap rubber suits so prevalent in bad dinosaur movies the dialogue is not only puerile and meaningless but often literally painful whoopee goldberg isnt even trying but george newbern as the voice of theodore rex is like fingernails on the soul and whether its juliet landua with her off again on again british accent or richard roundtree aka shaft as the blustering commissioner you will sink into an ever increasing sense of incredulity and disillusionmenti recommend this movie only to anyone who wishes to see the depths of stupidity to which mankind may fall<SEP>0
theres been a vogue for the past few years for often-as-not ironic zombie-related films as well as other media incarnations of the flesh- eating resurrected dead fido is a film thats either an attempt to cash in on that simply a manifestation of it or both -- and it falls squarely into the category of ironic zombies the joke here is that we get to see the walking dead in the contrasting context of a broadly stereotyped squeaky-clean alternate-history we are in the wake of a great zombie war and the creatures are now being domesticated as slaves version of a 1950s suburb its a moderately funny concept on its own and enough perhaps for a five-minute comedy sketch but it cant hold up a feature-film on its own the joke that rotting corpses for servants are incongruous with this idealized version of a small town is repeated over and over again and loses all effectiveness the soundtrack relentlessly plays sunny tunes while zombies cannibalize bystanders the word zombie is constantly inserted into an otherwise familiarly homey line for a cheap attempt at a laugh the very broadness and artificiality of the representation of the nineteen fifties here cant help but irritate me it is so stylized in it evidently pleasantville-inspired way that it is more apparent in waving markers of its 1950s-ness around than actually bearing any resemblance to anything that might have happened between 1950 and 1959 there is something obnoxiously sneering about it as if the film is bragging emptily and thoughtlessly about how more open down-to-earth and superior the 2000s are because the characters are such broad representations of pop-culture 1950s types its difficult to develop much emotional investment in them each has a few character traits thrown at him or her -- helen is obsessed with appearances and bill loves golf and his haunted by having had to kill his father -- but they remain quite two-dimensional performances within the constraints of this bad writing are fine the best is billy connolly as fido the zombie who in the tradition of boris karloff in frankenstein actually imparts character and sympathy to a lumbering green monster who cannot speak there are little bits of unsubtle allegory thrown around -- to commodity fetishism racism classism war paranoia et cetera but none of it really works on a comprehensive level and the filmmakers don;t really stick with anything unfortunately this film doesnt really get past sticking with the flimsy joke of look! zombies in leave it to beaver! for a good hour- and-a-half<SEP>0
almost as tedious to watch as it was to read evening is a gorgeously produced failureuntil meryl streep walks in and quietly shows her other cast members how to act this kind of stuff vanessa redgrave is shockingly off in her role as the dying ann and claire danes is a cipher perhaps if vanessa and claire had switched roles we could have seen the vibrancy in the young ann that gave her entrée to the rarefied world of the story and we could have imagined that the older ann actually was dying i was hoping the addition of michael cunningham to the writing credits would smooth out the jumpy storytelling but alas it gave me a headache<SEP>0
i have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as i personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the filmthe road side bar scene in russia in this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line - 50 dollarsyou drink and talk but i felt that my polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing russian accent than i could so i declined to take this speaking part on i was slightly starstruck as this was my first film experienceand who knows these lines could have ended up there with lines such as ill be back and quite frankly my dear i dont give a damn had i spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of rancid aluminium as heavy 1 instead of the name of ryszard janikowski as time goes on i am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this filmeven though i spent a whole day on the set in south wales hot-spot barry island no one could tell me what the actual storyline was the caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it things could certainly have been worse if id ended up naked in this most dreadful of filmsstillon the positive sidei got chatting to rhys ifans during one break i had no idea who he was as notting hill was yet to be released and not an inkling that he might be welsh made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit barry island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s it was only when keith allen showed up that i realised i was in a quality production<SEP>0
beating the bad guys again is the tag line for this movie it exposes so much truth about ithome alone one and two film classics home alone three and four a good film if youre three! like sharkboy and lavagirl as hard as it tries to be funny its not culkin is replaced by alex dlinz or something else hes a very bland actor with bland performances but its not entirely his fault the writing called for bland vocabulary and bland expressions the pranks are just copied from the first two with different crooks and youd have to be blind to think those chicken pox are real a good choice if you are a preschool teacher in which is showing this film on a rainy day and to make things worst a totally different cast go see if you dont believe me but youll regret it<SEP>0
until today i had never seen this film its was filmed on the sets of the old dark house and frankenstein and concerns a small bavarian village where supposedly giant bats are sucking the blood of the villagersfrankly its a damn good movie that has atmosphere to spare and a cast that wont quit lionel atwill dwight frye faye wray and melvin douglas playing a character named brettschnieder which is of interest to me since that was my great grandmothers maiden namethis is a carefully modulated film that has suspense and witty one liners that slowly builds for its brief running time only going astray when about ten minutes before the end they realized they had limited time to wrap everything up from that point to the end its a straight run to the finish with very little of the fun that preceded itleonard maltin and imdb list a running time of 71 minutes and warn of shorter prints the trouble is that imdb and maltin can be wrong and in this case i think they are since a source i trust more says the full running time is 67 minutes the overlook film encyclopedia quibbling about this i know is insane but since most prints that are available tend to run around 60-63 minutes the amount of missing material is considerably less if its only 67 minutes long personally i think it wont matter that much since its at most five minutes and i doubt very much it will make or break the filmwhat ever the running time if you like creaky old films do by all means do watch this movie its a great dark and stormy night film<SEP>1
the movie looked like a walk-through for immoral study most likely i never got much involved with the burning need of the female artist to immortalize male nudes and thus all that fuss about now who drew this penis! sounded a bit gratuitous dialogues in this movie are rather dreadful albeit visually this movie got its moments i almost dig it when tassi got into painting a mental picture but then movie weered back onto penises highly recommended to those who has not seen one in a while<SEP>1
at the time i recall being quite startled and amused by this movie i referred to it as the most important movie id seen in ten years and found myself bumping into people who said similar things bernhard has an unusually perceptive behavioral notebook and she has shaped the bitter adolescent personality that we all had into a corrosive adult world-view the two together provide a startling mix which may be too edgy for some viewers hi skip i wish you werent my brother so i could **** you! bernhards search for herself after returning to la from new york results in the immersive trying-on of various personas all of which fit poorly for our amusement but enough of them involve acting out to appeal to a black imperative values system that the real barometer of her resituation is whether black culture accepts her its been a while nina simone comes to mind and she has an impressive solidly-built black lover in the movie a pretty black girl attends the shows and seems to be authorizing sandras faux-blackness but ultimately rejects herjust as catholics deem themselves lucky to suffer for christ here sandra depicts herself suffering at the hands of a black culture in which she craves a place; as if she cherishes her worthiness and her rejection its the only value system implicated in the films world outside of bernhards arty confusionfor a nation whose chief issues are racism and money its refreshing to see one of the 2 topics dealt with in an atypical way<SEP>1
i really enjoyed this movie as a young kid at that age i thought that the silly baseball antics were funny and that the movie was cool because of its about sports now several years later i can look back and see what a well designed movie this was this movie opened my eyes as a small child to the struggles other children dealt with and real world issues that kind of exposure is largely lacking in kids movies these days which i dont think is to our societys benefit sure the baseball antics seem really dumb now but they drew kids in no seven year old is going to ask to see a movie about foster children but they will ask to see a movie about baseball disney realized this fact and took advantage of it to teach these children an important lesson about the worldas a young adult the performance of al and the other angels seems far less impressive however i will give credit to the actors playing both children and danny glover who all did a fantastic job<SEP>1
uta hagens respect for acting is the standard textbook in many college theater courses in the book hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor: the presentational approach and the representational approach in the presentational approach the actor focuses on realizing the character as honestly as possible by introducing emotional elements from the actors own life in the representational approach the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion through a high degree of control of movement and soundthe representational approach to acting was still partially in vogue when this hamlet was made british theater has a long history of this style of acting and olivier could be said to be the ultimate king of the representational schooltime has not been kind to this school of acting or to this movie nearly every working actor today uses a presentational approach to the modern eye oliviers highly enunciated stylized delivery is stodgy stiff and stilted instead of creating an internally conflicted hamlet olivier made a declaiming self-important bullhorn out of the melancholy dane -- an acting style that would have carried well to the backs of the larger london theaters but is far too starchy to carry off a modern hamletand so the movie creaks along ungainfully today oliviers tendency to e-nun-ci-ate makes some of hamlets lines unintentionally funny: in-stead you must ac-quire and be-get a tem-purr-ance that may give it smooth-ness! instead of crying at meeting his fathers ghost as any proper actor could bright fill lights in oliviers pupils give us that impressioneileen herlie is the only other actor of note in this hamlet putting in a good essay at the queen despite the painfully obvious age differences he was 41; she was 26 the other actors in this movie have no chance to get anything else of significance done given oliviers tendency to want to keep! the camera! on him! at all! times! sixty years later you feel the insecurity of the shakespearean stage actor who lacked the confidence to portray a breakable flawed hamlet and instead elected to portray a sort of elizabethan bullhorn final analysis: i would have such a fellow whipped for oer-doing termagant; it out-herods herod: pray you avoid it<SEP>0
i watched elephant walk for the first time in about 30 years and was struck by how similar the story line is to the greatly superior rebecca as others have said you have the sweet young thing swept off her feet by the alternately charming and brooding lord of the manor only to find her marriage threatened by the inescapable memory of a larger-than-life yet deeply flawed relative you have the stern and disapproving servant a crisis that will either bind the couple together or tear them irreparably apart climaxed by the fiery destruction of the lavish homesteadmeanwhile elephant walk also owes some of its creepy jungle atmosphere to the letter the bette davis love triangle set on a singapore rubber plantation rather than a sri lankan tea plantationmaltin gives elephant walk just two stars and imdb readers arent much kinder but i enjoyed it despite its predictability elizabeth taylor never looked lovelier and peter finch does a credible job as the basically good man unable to shake off the influence of his overbearing father dana andrews -- a favorite in laura and the best year of our lives -- is wasted as elizabeths frustrated admirer the real star is the bungalow one of the most beautiful interior sets in movie history<SEP>1
i go to the cinema to be entertained there is absolutely nothing entertaining about this film from beginning to end there is no respite from the gray grinding reality of this womans life it is one-paced with no change of mood i remained until the end only because i was convinced that things must get better they dont and i dont think i was the only one as evidenced by the many groans ringing around the cinema as the film drew mercifully to a close honestly depicting social depravation is no crime but boring your audience to groans is not the way to win the sympathy of the public a dreadful film<SEP>0
john schlesingers midnight cowboy is perhaps most notable for being the only x-rated film in academy history to receive the oscar for best picture this was certainly how i first came to hear of it and to be completely honest i didnt really expect much of the film this is not to say that i thought it would be horrible but somehow i didnt consider it the sort of movie that i would enjoy watching this is one reason why you should never trust your own instincts on such manners  a remarkable combination of stellar acting ambitious directing and a memorable soundtrack everybodys talking at me i dont hear a word theyre sayin make this film one of the finest explorations of life naivety and friendship ever releasedyoung joe buck then-newcomer jon voight dressed proudly as a rodeo cowboy travels from texas to new york to seek a new life as a hustler a male prostitute women however do not seem to be willing to pay money for his services and joe faces living in extreme poverty as his supply of money begins to dry up during these exploits joe comes to meet enrico ratso rizzo dustin hoffman a sickly crippled swindler who initially tries to con joe out of all his money when they come to realise that they are both in the same predicament ratso offers joe a place to stay and working together they attempt to make largely dishonest lives for themselves in the cold gritty metropolis of new yorkjoe had convinced himself that new york women would be more than willing to pay for sex; however his first such business venture ends with him guiltily paying the woman sylvia miles twenty dollars though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent ratso is just as naïve as joe ratso with his painful limp and hacking cough is always assuring himself that if only he could travel to the warmth of miami somehow everything would be all right this misguided expectation that things will get better so easily is quite reminiscent of lennie and george of john steinbecks classic novel of mice and menshot largely on the streets of new york midnight cowboy is a grittily-realistic look at life in the slums watching the film we can almost feel ourselves inside ratsos squalid unheated residence our joints stiff from the aching winter cold the acting certainly contributes to this ultra-realism with both voight and hoffman masterfully portraying the two decadent dregs of modern society hoffman in particular is exceptional in his role im walkin here! im walkin here! managing to steer well clear of being typecast after his much-lauded debut in 1967s the graduate both stars were later nominated for best actor oscars also nominated for acting  bafflingly  was sylvia miles for an appearance that cant have been for more than five minutes though both ultimately lost out to john wayne in true grit midnight cowboy eventually went on to win three oscars from seven nominations including best picture best director for schlesinger and best writing for waldo saltmidnight cowboy is told mainly in a linear fashion though there are numerous flashbacks that hint at joes past rather than explicitly explaining what these brief snippets are actually about the audience is invited to think about it for themselves and how these circumstances could have led joe onto the path he is now pursuing the achingly-beautiful final scene leaves us with a glimmer of hope but a large amount of uncertainty gritty thought-provoking and intensely fascinating midnight cowboy is one for the ages<SEP>1
i saw this film in its premier week in 1975 i was 13 years old and at that time i found it adequate and somewhat fun i then came to discover the world of doc savage through the bantam novels of the old pulp magazine stories i had no idea before any of this of the realm of doc but i fast became one of the most avid doc savage fans you could ever meet i read and still own all of the bantam books i started going to comic book cons along with star trek and doctor who and all manner of geeky fat kid events and had a wonderful time with each adventure i took with doc and the original fab 5 philip jose farmers book - the apocalyptic life of doc savage became a bit of a bible for me and to this day i have very fond feelings regarding my doc phase in so saying i have to admit now years later that this film really missed the boat it is a film that did not know what it wanted to be when it grew up the screenplay was infantile and bore little resemblance to the pulp story these stories from the 30s were short and if one looked at lester dents aka kenneth robeson outline for writing them they broke down into perfect 3 act dramas that screamed for screen treatment one would have thought that with george pal and michael anderson at the helm it would have turned out better the spoof elements miss the target and the more serious moments almost get there but then fall short it is interesting to watch though in that they hired second-string character actors guys that had really been only bit players and extras before this film who all acquit themselves very well paul gleason of course has gone on to be a fine utility player in all facets of entertainment and bill lucking is a television perennial all the rest have fallen off the map sadly i do wish to own a copy of this film as it is the only movie version of my hero but i fear i will not watch it much as it is too painful i would say 0 but i give it 2 out of 10 instead for some of the period art direction docs answering machine at the end was a nice touch and the cast of 3rd stingers getting a moment in the sun<SEP>0

this movie was almost intolerable to sit through i can get beyond the fact that it looks like it was shot with a home video camera and that this movie is supposed to span over weeks in time yet the characters do not once change outfits but the acting broke the 4th wall to pieces for me ive seen better acting in a 4th grade play aside from that the plot is unrealistic if the man suspected the guy he would have turned him in i was also heavily disappointed that all the killings were done with a gun what kind of gore is that that is not a copycat the zodiac did not kill using just a gun the authorities would have known it wasnt him another thing that really bothered me was that they called disassociative identity disorder dsm 4 when that is the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders not the name of the disorder overall i think this movie is not the kind of movie that could be done with a low budget at least not as low as they had or they could have made sure they had better actors or more gore plenty of people have went the low budget route with out having to use horrible actors look at easy rider that had dennis hopper and jack nicholson and a low budget<SEP>0
there should be more movies about our native americans i especially think that using actual real native americans would be the the right thing i know that this archie belaney who was played by pierce brosnan he did an excellent job in portraying that character since he was an englishman but my suggestion to hollywood is to put more american indians into the roles and never use anyone else the sioux nation has been put on the back burner far too long their poverty is a disgrace to our country it is my firm belief that our country should return the black hills to the sioux we ask israel to return their lands to the arabs but we do not make any effort to do the same we should be ashamed of ourselves we must practice what we preach!<SEP>1
after a love triangle story in har dil jo pyaar karega these 3 stars were again chosen in this controversial flick the film would have been considered as hit if there was not a controversy with the production values from bharat shah here director duo abbas-mustan did a very different and unique job as compared with their previous and after directorial ventures they are considered as thriller makers of bollywood but in this cccc they proved that they can equally handle to make a romantic family drama hardly there is a single action scene when preity was being raped by salmans colleague in her apartment salman slapped himthe movie has almost all the standards and ingredients like song story casting performances etc which are required to make a movie hit but of course for salmans fan this was something a surprise gift from him why because for so long he has been doing roles where he has a scene to show his open body and dance la-la-la all around his role as a rich young businessman who has no-nonsense nature and of normal attitude is really impressive after all madhubala a prostitute role performed by preity is amazing later when she too turns out thoughtful about her life she deserve proper attention her facial expressions and body language become more attractive and focus mainly goes to her her previous role as a pregnant woman in kya kehna was not that heart-touching as it is here of course this can be termed as improvement then priya a very innocent and helpless wife of raj who only depends on him for a better result she has nothing powerful influence in the story as the main ingredients are in the hands of preityfinally the main point of the story which is something rare and unique in itself in real world of this age it is not totally impossible to happen such step of searching for a surrogate mother perhaps many are happening in this large world where these are kept secret and in this way the scriptwriter of cccc has uncovered a hidden truth which is taking place in others daily lives but still then it is a doubt<SEP>1
perhaps i couldnt find the dvd menu selection for plot: on off clearly the default is off when the end credits began to roll i couldnt believe that was it like our poor but beautiful protagonist i felt used dirty cheapthe characters were drawn in very broad strokes and the writers disdain for wealthy thatcherites was all to apparent i consider myself a roosevelt democrat but would appreciate a bit more subtletyof course the problem could be with me i see that many others seem to find some meaning or message in this picture alas not i the only thing that kept me from giving this a 1 was the nice scenery human and plant<SEP>0
val kilmer solid performance dylan mcdermott solid performance josh lucas solid performance three very engaging actors giving decent performances the problem is who cares about the plot john holmes infamous for his well-endowments a drug addict and a guy who despite contracting aids continued to make adult films just does not make an intriguing characterthe story surrounds the events leading up to and the aftermath of a vicious mass murder that occurred in the late 80s in los angelos to which holmes was linked arrested and charged with murder and who ultimately was acquitted just like in the case of oj the guilt factor regardless of the outcome ranged quite high in the he did it zonethere is no one to sympathize with in this film as everyone is a self-serving criminal there is just nothing remotely interesting here<SEP>0
i came home late one night and turned on the tv to see siskel and ebert summarizing their picks of the week i didnt hear anything about red rock west except two thumbs up and see it before it went away it wouldnt stay in theaters very long because of the distributors money problems and lack of promotion but they said it deserved betterthe next afternoon i followed their advice they were right it was some of the most fun i have ever had at the movies as some readers point out there are a few plot holes and the last 10 minutes dont ever seem to end but its well worth it for the fine craftwork that went into the first hour its the best role that i have ever seen for nicholas cage but almost everybody seems perfectly cast dennis hopper goes almost over the top which gets silly but reinforces how well everything else works the sets and the music contribute a great deal to almost every scenewhen i rented it later for my family it didnt work as well the long scenes that built the tension in the theater were difficult to appreciate with the distractions at home it deserves your full attention; turn off the phone make sure you wont be disturbed watch and listen to every scene especially in the beginning<SEP>1
diego armando maradona had been sixteen years of age in 1978 when argentina won the world cup at home he was already the biggest star and the greatest player in a country obsessed with football everybody had begged cesar luis menotti to play the boy genius but the manager thought that he was not yet readyhistory records that argentina won the 1978 world cup fairly convincingly - they hadnt really needed maradona the same was not true in 1982 spain was a catalogue of disaster for argentina menotti - still chain smoking - played diego this time but the occasion was too much for such a temperamental boy maradona had signed for barcelona on june 4 1982 for around $7 million - nine days later he played his first game at the camp nou and belgium beat argentina one-nil it was not an auspicious debut and even though he scored twice against hungary in the next match maradona will remember the mundial as the site of his nadir - a crude petulant foul on brazils batista in the second round that abruptly ended his tournament and argentinas reign as world championsbut now that was all behind him maradona had muddled his way through some crazy times at barca and left in 1984 to join napoli it was as if he was finally home the neapolitan tifosi had done everything to entice maradona to poor underachieving napoli gifts from old women and pocket money from young boys nestled uncomfortably with the camorras millions as part of the transfer fee and the city was determined to make him feel at home so for the time being at least maradona was el rey - he brought his argentine side to mexico as one of the favourites and with a new manager - carlos bilardo replacing menottimaradona is the hero of this story a one-man world cup winning machine in 1982 hundreds of young men had died in a pointless battle for the falkland isles; now the british press yearned for a rematch with the same result in mexico city maradona was still regarded with distinction in england remembered more for a superb performance in britain during a 1980 tour than for spain but he was still an argie: the enemyengland actually started well and lineker could have scored after only twelve minutes a key event happened on 8 minutes fenwick the big and limited english defender was booked - he was now terrified of making any challenges around the penalty areaafter a tense first 45 minutes the second half started with a bang maradona danced forward after 50 minutes but could find no way through similarly valdanos attempt hit only white shirts then the moment of infamy that serves as diegos epitaph hodge bizarrely hooked the ball back into his own penalty area shilton hurriedly jumped to claim - but there was maradona somehow rising above the english goalkeeper to thrust the ball into the net how had he done it simple: handballthe most famous foul in football history passed in near slow motion every spectator waited for mr al-sharif of syria to blow for the foul he didnt shilton looked and appealed to the linesman - he ran back to the centre circle unless he assassinates the pope or becomes the first man to step foot on mars when the great man dies this moment will be shown first - in long lingering slow motion followed by the look of glee on his face the next image will be his next gift to the world - the world cups finest goalburruchaga stroked the ball to maradona who was ambling around on the right hand side of his own half he span and accelerated away from beardsley and reid this was the real diego - he burst through butcher and attacked fenwick fenwick now had the opportunity to stop the attack normally he would have aimed his boot somewhere near maradonas thigh - sure he would have picked up a red card but who cares then fenwick had a brainwave - he hesitated and decided to run at maradona waving his arms - perhaps he was trying to put him off diego shot into the box as fenwick fell over butcher had been running alongside the genius as if he was offering encouragement shilton charged out in panic and maradona twisted around him and prepared to score now butcher remembered his role and tried to cripple the argentinean - instead he gave extra impetus to the shot which smashed into the goal england were coming homeduring this magical mexican summer the world had found a successor for pele in fact the greatest ever footballer had been surpassed - pele had been superb in 1958 and 1970 but had had great players all around him maradona did not 1986 was his world cup<SEP>1
a sophisticated contemporary fable about the stresses that work to loosen and ultimately unbind the vows of marriage the main thrust of the narrative arises from a homily spoken by a country priest following the wedding vows of a young cosmopolitan couple from milan in it the future course of the marriage is spelled out which bit by bit frays from the stresses of modern life the moral of this story within a story is that in order for a marriage to work out both now and in the past it has been necessary for that relationship to be abutted by family and friends this film was a relative blockbuster by domestic italian standards its a terrible shame that this film is not available in either dvd or vhs<SEP>1
considering the limits of this film the entire movie in one setting - a music studio - only about 5 or 6 actors total it should have been much better made if you have these limits in making a film how could the lighting be so bad and the actors were terrible were talking a hair below the acting in clerks except that was an enjoyable movie this had no substance well it tried to but really failsit makes attempt to be self-referencing in a couple parts but the lines were delivered so poorly by the actors it was just bad and the main character neal guy what a pathetic looser clearly like 10 people total made this film and they all knew each other and it probably was a real rock band that they had but unfortuntly these people really have no idea how terrible they are all around this was made in 2005 but they all look so naieve it smacks of just pre-grunge erathankfully i didnt pay to see this starz on demand delivers again! but it was under the title the possessed not studio 666 it doesnt matter what you do to the title it cant help this this could have been a much better made movie - there is no excuse for this bad film-making when you have the obvious limited parameters the filmmakers had when they made this working within those limits you should make the stuff you can control and the stuff you can work with the best you can instead they figured mediocrity would be good enough and that music video wow that was bad i fast fowarded through thatso 210 is fair if you are into the whole b-movie crap i suppose youll go and see this<SEP>0
i cant believe this is on dvd even less it was available at my local video storesome argue this is a good movie if you take in consideration it had only a 4000$ budget i find this funny i would find it very bad whichever the budgetstill more funny i read the following in another review: dramatics aside if you love horror and you love something along the lines of duel 1971 updated with a little more story and some pretty girls thrown in youll love this moviewhat! this is a shame comparing those two moviesi give a 1 since i cant give a 0 i just dont see any way this movie could be entertaining<SEP>0
this movie deserves more than a 1 but im giving it a one because so many fricken fan boys have given it a 10 resulting in it getting a rating thatll take it into the top 100 list seriously its not that great its not that bad its a stupid cult classic with so many fricken fan boys its ridiculous these are the types who probably still laugh at chuck norris jokes and still say im rick james b!tch no matter how old or annoying it gets i dread having to hear im tired of mfn snakes on this mfn plane months from now from idiots trying to be funny its crappy plot crap acting etc its okay to love a bad movie but you still gotta admit its a bad moviewait for the marine starring john cena if you wanna see a real movie<SEP>0
there is no possible reason i can fathom why this movie was ever madewhy must hollywood continue to crank out one horrible update of a classic after another cases in point: mister magoo the avengers - awful! christopher lloyd whom i normally enjoy was so miserably miscast in this role his manic portrayal of our beloved uncle martin is so unspeakably unenjoyable to be almost criminal his ranting groaning grimacing and histrionics provide us with no reason to care for his character except as some 1 dimensional cartoon characterthe director must have thought that fast movements screaming dialogue and one-take slapstick had some similarity to comedy apparently he told every actor to act as if they had red ants in their pantsfault must lie with the irresponsibly wrought script i think the writer used its a mad mad mad mad world as an example of a fine comedy script as manic as that 1963 classic is it is far superior to this claptrap - in fact - suddenly it looks pretty good in comparisonwhat is most sad about this movie is that it must have apparently been written to appeal to young children i just am not sure whose children it was made for certainly no self-respecting card-carrying child i know!if they had to remake my favorite martian why didnt they add some of the timeless charm of the original classic unfortunately imdbcom cannot factor in zero as a rating for its readers that is the only rating that comes to mind in describing this travestyone good thing did come from this movie the actors and crew were paid - i think<SEP>0
warning!!! tons of dead giveaways!!! dont read if you havent seen this series! or you can whatevertheyre are few words to describe a movie that claims to be the last and comes out with another; liars cheats maybe even some words that cant be uttered but when elm street 6: freddys dead shows everyone who thought the series got old and wanted to stop seeing him or people who wanted their hero or villian just stops for his final breath this film was itthis film starts with a parody of wizard of oz then you see a kid who is named only as john doe who is the last child in springwood ohio leaves and gets out of freddy territory a woman who resides at a hospital place to get kids off their feet kind of place meets this boy and at the same time has a dream about a man a water tower and a promise of a secret floating in her mind goes back to springwood to figure out this frightening vision and soon finds out that she is freddys child and we soon find out that freddy can only leave springwood if his daughter can be a sort of host for him and beyond that fright ensues this film seems to hit the nail on the head of everything you wanted to knowthis film has tons of humor and cameo appearences like rosanne barr and tom arnold alice cooper johnny depp and a very young breckin meyer playing a teenage stoner who sees psychadelic vision of flowers and iron butterflys in-a-gadda-da-vida then gets stuck in a super mario parody of sorts this film will either make you hate this movie or like krueger even more the best of the best<SEP>1
spoilers aheadthis is one of the worst movies ever made - its that simple there is not one redeeming quality about this movie the first 10 minutes are quite tricky - they actually lead you to believe that this film will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat instead you will spend 83 minutes punching yourself while watching stolen and poorly made scenes run without any organization the lake was ridiculous looked like an aquarium and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed characters show their advanced teleportation powers for example alex thomas who falls into the lake drunk and then ends up on his boat in an impossible position angie harmon put up a pitiful performance as kate made worse by the space-time continuum rupturing dialog that appears to have been written at the last minute by a fifth grader an example of this would be when she said flashlight! in such a stupid manner that it shows the threshold of how much a human body can cringe before it snaps in half finally the editing of this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrific that i have ever seen it was like the cameramen were a bunch of chimps who had been given camcorders by scientists an example of this would be when we suddenly get a closeup of the headlight on alexs car i would bet that there was little to no time spent editing this movie the ending was absolutely pathetic the writers were obviously trying to create some sort of mysterious plot line that made the viewer say oh yeah! instead were left to view some dumb painting of a spider that somehow fits into the story line unfortunately there is not one perspective in the millions out there that could save this movie from being a festering piece of crapi give this a 5 out of 10 the 5 being from the fact that this movie was recorded on film instead of becoming a picture book<SEP>0
im glad that users as of this date who liked this movie are now coming forward i dont understand the people who didnt like this movie - it seems like they were expecting a serious !! treatment! cmon how the hell can you take the premise of a killer snowman seriously the filmmakers knew this was a silly premise and they didnt try to deny it the straight-faced delivery of scenes actually makes it funny! yes there are times where the low budget shows such as that explosion scene but i think an expensive look would have taken away from the fun of the movie! so if you like b-movies and the goofy premise appeals to you then youll certainly like jack frost<SEP>1
i moved out here to get away from this kind of thing! the small town sheriff lamentsthis happens a lot in chicago his deputy askswell no not really the plot is that a group of martians mistake a halloween rebroadcast of orson welles war of the worlds as an account of a real martian invasion and conclude they need to get in on the action! what follows are a bunch of mishaps involving the martians haphazard attempts to conquer the town of big bean il everyone concludes they are kids in really good costumes except for the sheriffs daughter and her friend a kid in a duck suitthe martians themselves are comical and you get the impression they are no threat to anyone but themselves pretty early on its a fun family movie<SEP>1
fulci experiments with sci fi and fails usually in his non horror films we still get sum great gore but not here sum very funny scenes like when the prisinors are forced to hold onto a bar for 12 minutes and if they drop they are electecuted the guy falls and and has some kind of fit on the floor for about two minutes until his friends who were struggling to hold on anyway lift him off the floor the city is an obvious model but not a bad one and the end explosion is at best laughable and dont get me started on the terrible battle scenes410<SEP>0
people call this a comedy but when i just watched it i laughedonly once i guess the problem is that i first saw it when i was 14and i wasnt old enough to understand that it wasnt meant to betaken seriously there were quite a few scenes that were meantto be funny but i cared too much about the characters to laugh atthemi suggest that you watch this film next time youre falling in loveand try to take it seriously i think youll find that despite a few sillyflaws its one of the most moving love stories youve ever seen<SEP>1
nobasically your watching something that doesnt make sense to not spoil the film for people who actually want to this take a look at the flick i will explain the storya normal everyday to day women is walking down a street then finds herself driving by in her own car she follows her and many events take place during that time that include her and her familyi specifically made an account to comment on this film of how horribly written this was the acting was great the events were great but the story just brought it nowhere - it could of been added to tremendously and be made into a worldwide epidemic im not sure what the writer was trying to accomplish by making this usually at the end of films most of your questions get answers but this film has you asking what just happened and 1 hour 20 minutes just passed for nothingspoiler starts__they had this area between 2 dimensions ours and behind the glass that would come into our world and kill us it was not elaborated on all during the film and you never know how it was happening or why it was or when it happened nothing gets explained during the film the main character shouldnt of even been the main character at the end of the film the guy who finally figures it all out and runs away her sisters boyfriend should of been the main character but sadly the movie ends 20 seconds after i bought this movie for $10 threw it out right after dont waste your time i really hope nothing like this is made again<SEP>0
the ballad of django is a meandering mess of a movie! this spaghetti western is simply a collection of scenes from other and much better! films supposedly tied together by django telling how he brought in different outlaws hunt powers john cameron brings nothing to the role of django skip this one unless you just have to have every django movie made and even that may not be a good enough excuse to see this one!!<SEP>0
curl up with this one on a dark and stormy night and prepare to be alternately amused irritated and frightened the creaky old plot about about a phantom train thats said to run through the lonely english countryside at dead of night may be implausible but its a lot of fun there are some wonderful old cliches like the accident which the locals can remember but wont talk about but primarily the movies a vehicle for comedian arthur askey to showcase his particular brand of vaudeville style humour in between the scary bits askeys corny humor is not very trendy these days but if you just let it wash over you it can be fun this is probably the best of askeys movies<SEP>1
ummm please forgive me but werent more than half the characters missing in the original novel valjean is a man imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread and then attempting several times to escape he breaks parole and is pursued relentlessly by the police inspector javert along the way there are many characters that werent in this version some worth mentioning would be fantine cosette m & mme thenardier eponine marius gavroche and enjolras the only character with the same name is javert i was confused and frustrated throughout the whole movie trying to see how it was in any way connected to victor hugos epic novel<SEP>0
the effects of job related stress and the pressures born of a moral dilemma that pits conscience against the obligations of a family business albeit a unique one all brought to a head by-- or perhaps the catalyst of-- a midlife crisis are examined in the dark and absorbing drama `panic written and directed by henry bromell and starring william h macy and donald sutherland its a telling look at how indecision and denial can bring about the internal strife and misery that ultimately leads to apathy and that moment of truth when the conflict must of necessity at last be resolved alex macy is tired; he has a loving wife martha tracey ullman a precocious six-year-old son sammy david dorfman a mail order business he runs out of the house as well as his main source of income the `family business he shares with his father michael sutherland and his mother deidre barbara bain but hes empty; years of plying this particular trade have left him numb and detached putting him in a mental state that has driven him to see a psychologist dr josh parks john ritter and to make matters worse or maybe better depending upon perspective in dr parks waiting room he meets a young woman sarah cassidy neve campbell whose presence alone makes him feel alive for the first time since he can remember she quickly becomes another brick in the wall of the moral conflict his job has visited upon him as in the days after their meeting he simply cannot stop thinking about her his whole life it seems has become a `situation-- one from which he is seemingly unable to successfully extirpate himself without hurting the ones he loves he can deny his age and the fact that he has indeed slipped into a genuine midlife crisis but he is about to discover that the problems he is facing are simply not going to go away on their own hes at a crossroads and hes going to have to decide which way to go and hes going to have to do it very soon from a concept that is intrinsically interesting bromell has fashioned an engrossing character study that is insightful and incisive and he presents it is a way that allows for moments of reflection that enable the audience to empathize and understand what alex is going through he makes it very clear that there are no simple answers that in real life there is no easy way out his characters are well defined and very real people who represent the diversity found in life and moreover within any given family unit the film resoundingly implies that the sins of the father are irrefutably passed on to the progeny with irrevocable consequences and effects when youre growing up you accept your personal environment as being that of the world at large; and often it is years into adulthood that one may begin to realize and understand that there are actually moral parameters established by every individual who walks upon the planet and that the ones set by the father may not be conducive to the tenets of the son and it is at that point that alex finds himself as the story unfolds; ergo the midlife crisis or more specifically the crisis of conscience from which he cannot escape its a powerful message succinctly and subtly conveyed by bromell with the help of some outstanding performances from his actors for some time william h macy has been one of the premiere character actors in the business creating such diverse characters as quiz kid donnie smith in `magnolia the shoveler in `mystery men and jerry lundegaard in `fargo and thats just a sampling of his many achievements at one point in this film sarah mentions alexs `sad eyes and its a very telling comment as therein lies the strength of macys performance here his ability to convey very real emotion in an understated believable way that expresses all of the inner turmoil he is experiencing consider the scene in which he is lying awake in bed staring off into the darkness; in that one restless moment it is clear that he is grappling not only with his immediate situation but with everything in his life that has brought him finally to this point in that scene you find the sum total of a life of guilt confusion and uncertainty all of which have been successfully suppressed until now; all the things that have always been at the core of alexs life only now gradually breaking through his defense mechanisms and finally surfacing demanding confrontation and resolution its a complex character created and delivered by macy with an absolute precision that makes alex truly memorable its a character to whom anyone who has ever faced a situation of seemingly insurmountable odds will be able to relate its a terrific piece of work by one of the finest actors around sutherland is extremely effective as well; his michael is despicably sinister in a way that is so real its chilling its frightening in fact to consider that there are such people actually walking the earth this is not some pulp fiction or james bond type villain but a true personification of evil hiding behind an outward appearance that is so normal he could be the guy next door which is what makes it all the more disconcerting and sutherland brings it all to life brilliantly with a great performance neve campbell looks the part of sarah but her performance as is the usual case with her seems somewhat pretentious although her affected demeanor here just happens to fit the character and is actually a positive aspect of the film if only she would occasionally turn her energies inward it would make a tremendous difference in the way she presents her characters `panic however is one of her best efforts; a powerful film that in the end is a journey well worth taking 910<SEP>1
as one of the few commentators not to have seen the 1st film i found this to be a very disappointing movieyes it has a funny awkward type of humour if you can bear the highly morally dubious premise however it fails abysmally in the important areasthere is thin and nonsensical plot line involving gordon sinclairs generous friend who may or may not be entwined in a conspiracy to supply dangerous electronics to third world countries - possibly in free computers or possibly not vague long-winded and inconclusive the lack of any substantial ending is so infuriating and what is present is pompous and wholly illogical the film feels half-finishedsuspension of disbelief is extremely difficult when witnessing a very attractive female teacher maria doyle kennedy can be drawn to gordon sinclairs unimpressive character especially when he fends off her advances laughable it worsens later in the film when he achieves his romantic ambitions then throws it all away for some ideals based on very little evidence of ambiguous valuenot many films leave me feeling cheated but i felt my time was stolen<SEP>0
i am a 11th grader at my high school in my current world affairs class a kid in my class had this video and suggested we watch so we did i am firm believer that we went to the moon being that my father works for nasa even though i think this movie is the biggest piece of crap i have ever watched the guy who created it has some serious balls first of all did he have to show jfk getting shot and how dare he use all those biblical quotes the only good thing about this movie is it sparks debates which is good bc in my class we have weekly debates this movie did nothing to change my mind i think he and michael moore should be working together and make another movie michael moore next movie could be called a funny thing happened on spetember 11th or a funny thing happened on the way to the white house<SEP>0
theres some very clever humour in this film which is both a parody of and a tribute to actors however after a while it just seems an exercise in style notwithstanding great gags such as balasko continuing the part of dussolier and very good acting by all involved and i was wondering why blier made this film all is revealed in the ending when blier directing claude brasseur gets a phone call from his dad bernard blier - from heaven and gets the chance to say how much he misses him an effective emotional capper and obviously heartfelt but there isnt really sufficient dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the film interesting throughout its entire running time some really nice scenes and sequences however and anyone who likes these mosntres sacrés of the french cinema should get a fair amount of enjoyment out of this film<SEP>1
during a kurt weill celebration in brooklyn where do we go from here was finally unearthed for a screening it is amazing that a motion picture from any era that has weill-gershwin collaborations can possibly be missing from the screens the score stands tall and a cd of the material with gershwin and weill only underscores its merits which are considerable yes the film has its problems but the score is not one of them ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy and fred macmurray cannot quite grasp the material then too the modern segment is weakly written but the fantasy elements carry the film to a high mark as does the work of the two delightful leading ladies - joan leslie and june haver both have the charm that this kind of work desperately needs to work as a world war ii salute to our countrys history - albeit in a never was framework the film has its place in hollywood musical history and should be available for all to see and to find its considerable merits<SEP>1
seven pounds this was the movie where i was just convinced will smith is really going for the im going to make you cry films one thing i can give him a ton of credit for the man can cry my only thing is as moving as the story is will smith has proved time and time again that he can act so why is he taking this extremely depressing story but nevertheless its still a good movie i do have to admit it made me cry but i felt that the stand out performance was rosario dawson i absolutely love this girl ever since i saw her in 25th hour with ed norton i knew this girl was going to go far shes beautiful charming funny and talented cant wait to see how much further her career is going to go but her and will smith not so sure if they had the great chemistry that the film needed that wouldve made this into a great filmtwo years ago tim thomas was in a car crash which was caused by him using his mobile phone; seven people died: six strangers and his fiancée a year after the crash and having quit his job as an aeronautical engineer tim donates a lung lobe to his brother ben an irs employee six months later he donates part of his liver to a child services worker named holly after that he begins searching for more candidates to receive donations he finds george a junior hockey coach and donates a kidney to him and then donates bone marrow to a young boy named nicholas two weeks before he dies he contacts holly and asks if she knows anyone who deserves help she suggests connie tepos who lives with an abusive boyfriend tim moves out of his house and into a local motel taking with him his pet box jellyfish one night after being beaten connie contacts tim and he gives her the keys and deed to his beach house she takes her two children and moves in to their new home having stolen his brothers credentials and making himself known by his brothers name ben he checks out candidates for his two final donations the first is ezra turner a blind vegetarian meat salesman who plays the piano tim calls ezra turner and harasses him at work to check if he is quick to anger ezra remains calm and tim decides he is worthy he then contacts emily posa a self-employed greeting card printer who has a heart condition and a rare blood type he spends time with her weeding her garden and fixing her rare heidelberg printer he begins to fall in love with her and decides that as her condition has worsened he needs to make his donationseven pounds is a good film and no doubt worth a look i would just recommend going for the rental vs the theater will smith pulls in a good performance but not his best just most of the film required him crying in every scene but the last one with him is a doozy but i loved the ending it was beautiful and really made you appreciate life and to not take it for granted there is still good people in this world and bens character reminds you to value life and to give to those who are in desperate need although he went a little far but it was still a beautiful story710<SEP>1
this movie was good for its time if you like eddie murpy this is a must have to add to your collection eddie was young and funny with his 80s haircut charlotte lewis eddies costar is hot this was one of her first movies and she was not bad the graphics were good for the 80s a lot of the actors went on to do other good movies you should check them out through imdb other must have from eddie is coming to america and 48 hours another actor victor wong has a small part in this movie check out some of his older movies like big trouble in little china if you liked the action movies from the 80s this is your movie<SEP>1
i would not like to comment on how good the movie was or what were the flaws as i am not a professional film critic and i do not have enough knowledge of making movies what i do know is that making this kind of a movie in your very first shot is a big achievement and i would like to congratulate the director for that however in some reviews that i have read critics have complained that hiralals relationship with his brothers was not highlighted and his siblings were completely erased from the story now i would really like to raise a point here that as the name of the movie suggests it is not a movie about hiralals brothers it is a movie on the relationship of mahatma gandhi and his son hiralal gandhi nothing more nothing less if we start complaining about some characters being kept out of action in the movie it would be a bit unfair because these characters dont fit in the picture no matter how relevant they were in real life so i think it would be better if we stick to the main idea and stop satisfy a critic in ourselvesenjoy!!!!<SEP>1
i wish more movies were two hours long on the other hand i wish more american civil war movies were merely two hours long gone with the wind gettysburg - thats about the length ive come to expect; although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted; and even gettysburg lasted as long as it did because things happened in the course of itby contrast ang lees film is bloated and uneventful it actually feels as if it takes much less than two hours that wasnt a compliment its really no different to any other form of sensory deprivation: at the time it feels as though it will never end afterwards it seems to have taken no time at allthe film gets off on the wrong foot as lee plays his interminable credits over the opening footage bad mistake in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will later come to loathe the central two are jake the son of german immigrants who are staunch supporters of lincoln and jack an equally staunch southerner whose values jake shares i had to re-read that sentence to make sure i hadnt written jack instead of jake at some point or vice versa the two go off to become bushwhackers - southern militia who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that they cant even be bothered to join the official southern army which i presume they think is for sissies im afraid lee lost me right there its easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes: if we have some independent reason to like them or feel as if we know them in some way then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more not so here we arent properly introduced to jake for at least an hour; when we are it becomes clear hes a gormless pimple of a man who isnt a confederate by choice so much as by habit - the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does whose psychology is purely immitative the people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way i found myself cheering whenever the northern cavalry appeared on the screen i thought: good - kill the rebels end the damned war let me go homeaggravating this problem is the horrible horrible dialogue everyone speaks in the same whining southern accent ive heard accents from all over the english-speaking world and this is the worst of them all i dont care if southerners really did talk like that its simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours and believe me we do listen to it for the full two hours: lees picture is a talky one largely because characters take so long to say what they mean in their ungrammatical say-everything-three-times folksy drawl it would help if they talked faster but not much cant these people find a more efficient language in which to communicatein short: the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters with no inner life who talk in an offensively ugly mode of speech who dont bathe often enough to whom nothing of interest happens despite their being involved in a war good points jewel was nice to look at and so was the scenery but i have complaints even here the cinematography nicely framed looked as if someone had susbtituted colour film for black and white by mistake; and as for jewel we were teased with her body but never actually allowed to gaze upon it which i think is the least we were owed<SEP>0
meryl streep was incredible in this film she has an amazing knack for accents and she shows incredible skill in this film overall i really felt for her when lindy was being persecuted she was played realistically too she got cranky upset and unpleasant as the media and the government continued their unrelenting witchhunt i didnt expect much from the film initially but i really got interested in it and the movie is based on a real person and real events it turned out to be better than i had anticipated sam neill was also outstanding; this is the best work ive seen from him and ive really liked him in other movies the piano for example i gave the film a 7 but if i could rate just the acting id give the it a 95 and a perfect 10 for streep<SEP>1
this movie displays the kind of ensemble work one wishes for in every film barbara bain and donald sutherland who play husband and wifeare positive chilling discussing the family business as if it were a grocery store or a dry cleaners macy campbell ullman and ritter are also terrific they play off each other like members of a top-notch theatrical troupe who realize that a quality product requires each actor to support the others unselfishly and finally theres sammy david dorfman what an amazing performance from a childand what an uncanny resemblance he has to ullman whose son he plays!were treated to a unique story in panic and thats a rarity in these days of tired formulaic crap the dialogue is sharp and smart and this relatively short film nevertheless has the power to elicit a full range of emotions from the viewer there are places to laugh to be shocked to be horrified to be saddened to be aroused to be angry and to love its not a movie that leaves you jumping for joy but when its over youre more than satisfied knowing youve spent the last ninety minutes experiencing a darn good piece of workmore of us would go to theatres if we were treated to quality fare like this when are the powers that be in hollywood going to wake up its a real shame when something this good fails to get exposure beyond festivals and households fortunate enough to have cable<SEP>1

years ago when i was a poor teenager my best friend and my brother both had a policy that the person picking the movie should pay and while i would never pay to see some of the crap they took me to i couldnt resist a free trip to the movies! thats how i came to see crap like the second conan movie and never say never again! now despite this being a wretched movie it is in places entertaining to watch--in a brain dead sort of way and technically the stunts and camera-work are good so this elevates my rating all the way to a 2! so why is the movie so bad well unlike the first rambo movie this one has virtually no plot rambo himself only says about 3 words other than grunts and yells there is a needless and completely irrelevant and undeveloped romance and the movie is one giant and stupid special effect and what stupifyingly awful special effects while 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are shot at rambo none have any effect on him and almost every bullet or arrow rambo shoots hits its mark! and while the bad guys are using ak-47s helicopters and rockets in some scenes all rambo had is a bow and arrows with what seem like nuclear-powered tips!! the scene where the one bad guy is shooting at him as he slowly and calmly launches one of these exploding arrows is particularly made for dumb viewers! it was wonderfully parodied in uhf starring weird al plus hot shots part deux also does a funny parody of the genre--not just this stupid sceneall-in-all a movie so dumb and pointless its almost like self-parody!<SEP>0
seriously the fact that this show is so popular just boggles the mind this show isnt funny it isnt clever it isnt original its just a steaming pile of bull crap let me start with the characters the characters are all one-dimensional morons with loud exaggerated voices that just sound like fingernails on a blackboard the voice acting couldve been better then theres the animation my god it hurts my eyes just looking at it everything is too flat too pointy too bright and too candy coated then theres the humor or lack thereof its completely idiotic! they just take these b-grade jokes that arent even that funny in the first place and then repeat them to death they also throw in some pointless potty humor which sickens me and finally last and least the music its just plain annoying it sounds like it was composed on a childs computer and generates no emotion whatsoever i wish there was a score lower than 1 i really do this show seriously needs to be canceled its a show i try to avoid like the plague whenever i hear the theme song i immediately turn the tv off if youve never watched this show then dont watch quality programming like the simpsons or futurama<SEP>0
this is a nice piece of work very sexy and engaging enough plot to keep my interest throughout its main disadvantage is that it seems like it was made-for-tv: full screen and though there were several sex scenes there was absolutely no nudity but boy did it come close! strange too since netflix shows that it was rated rnonetheless very titillating and i wish alicia silverstone made more movies like thisone netflix reviewer stated that it was part of a series but i have been unable to find out what series that is id like to find out though because this movie was that goodwalt d in lv 8232005<SEP>1

this movie is so so so horrible that it makes angels lose their wings shaq had tried to make other crossover efforts like his work in shaq-fu for the nes and his plethora of unbearable rap albums and later the epic serving of horrible film-making that is steeltheres not a single good thing to be said about this movie i saw it a bunch of times when i was very young but i mustve been an idiot then because this movie takes all that is enjoyable about films and tears it apart its fun to mock i saw it on the disney channel a while back and spent a few minutes doing that although once the thrill of mocking it is done you still become overwhelmed by its terriblenessif you see it on tv try this: consider as your watching the film removing from it all the scenes in which shaq uses his magical genie powers if you do that it becomes like a film about a pedophile chasing a kid and rapping to seduce him thats kinda funny and disturbinga horrible example of film do not unless looking to mock it see this movie<SEP>0
this film is so bad i cant believe it was actually shot people who voted 10 or 9 8 and even 7 are you insane did we really watch the same movie or the same sh** should i say everything is bad in this film the story is there a story is going nowhere completely incoherent the acting some dialogs are simply just ridiculous the music score what the **** is that the editing and especially the artistic direction a pure disaster reminds me the old macist movies to give you an example of the amateurism of the production the mermaids costume is a sleeping bag with spangles sticked on it im not joking thats exactly what it isanother example of the enormous mistakes we find here: you see in a scene an extra a fat woman of about 200 pounds whos talking on her cell phone the next shot which is in a complete different location you can see this same woman still talking on her cell phone ! yes it goes that far a big huge waste of money useless<SEP>0
it was just a terrible movie no one should waste their time go see something else this movie is without a doubt one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life if you want to see a good movie dont see made men<SEP>0
this woman who works as an intern for a photographer goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling so she goes to find out that her neighbor above her is a photographer this movie could have had a great plot but then the plot drains of any hope the problem i had with this movie is that every ten seconds someone is snorting heroin if they took out the scenes where someone snorts heroin then this would be a pretty good movie every time i thought that a scene was going somewhere someone inhaled the white powder it was really lame to have that much drug use in one movie it pulled attention from the main plot and a great story about a photographer the lesbian stuff didnt bother me i was looking for a movie about art i found a movie about drug use<SEP>0
sometimes a premise starts out good but because of the demands of having to go overboard to meet the demands of an audience suffering from attention-deficit disorder it devolves into an incongruous mess and for three well-respected actors who have made better work before and after this is a mortal shameso lets see premise: a loving couple who lives in a beautiful home is threatened by a bad cop interesting to say the least make the encroaching cop a little disturbing why not it was well done in the hand who rocks the cradle and single white female and its a proved ticket to a successful thrillernow herein lies the dilemma create a disturbing story that actually bothers to bring some true menace into its main characters while never going so far as to look ridiculous or throw any semblance to reality amp up the shock factor and make this cop so extreme -- an ultra bad variation of every other super-villain thats hit cinemas since the silent agethe producers and directors chose the latter thus is the resulting film -- badly made with actors trying their darnedest to make heads or tails in roles that theyve essayed before and nothing much amounting to even less<SEP>0
i researched this film a little and discovered a web site that claims it was actually an inside joke about the post wwii greenwich village world of gays and lesbians with the exception of stewart and novak the warlocks and witches represented that alternative lifestyle john van druten who wrote the stage play was apparently gay and very familiar with this greenwich village i thought this was ironic because i first saw bell book and candle in the theater when i was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me it was hard to get me to a movie that didnt include horses machine guns or alien monsters and i planned on being bored but i remember the moment when jimmy stewart embraced kim novak on the top of the flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it fluttering to the ground as the glorious george duning love theme soared i suddenly got a sense of what it felt like to fall in love the first stirrings of romanticsexual love left me dazed as i left the theater i am sure im not the only pre-adolescent boy who was seduced by kim novaks startling direct gaze its ironic that a gay parable was able to jump-start heterosexual puberty in so many of us i am in my late 50s now and re-watched the film yesterday evening and those same feelings stirred as i watched that hat touch down fifty years later<SEP>1
read my lips sur mes lèvres which probably has different idiomatic resonance in its french title is a nifty twisty contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime caper as the unusually matched characters slide up and down an ethical and sensual slippery slopethe two leads are magnetic emmanuelle devos who ive never seen before despite her lengthy resume in french movies and an even more disheveled than usual vincent cassel who has brought a sexy andor threatening look and voice to some us moviesthe first half of the movie is on her turf in a competitive real estate office and hes the neophyte the second half is on his turf as an ex-con and her wrenching adaptation to that milieuwriterdirector jacques audiard very cleverly uses the womans isolating hearing disability as an entrée for us into her perceptions turning the sound up and down for us to hear as she does so its even more annoying than usual when audience members talk using visuals as sensory reactors as wellnone of the characters act as anticipated she is not like that pliable victim from in the company of men not in individual interactions not in scenes and not in the overall arc of the unpredictable story line well until the last shot but heck the audience was waiting for that fulfillment as we move from a hectic modern office to a hectic disco to romantic and criminal stake-outs there is a side story thats thematically redundant and unnecessary but that just gives us a few minutes to catch our breathsthis is one of my favorites of the year! originally written 7282002<SEP>1
lets hope this is the final nightmare this is the epitome of a good thing gone bad okay there is still some enjoyment to be had but only in the most mundane sense rachel talalay had been there for the duration of this franchise had been on the production staff and produced even i dont know what she was thinking but this debacle comes complete with the human video game boy and a guest appearance bytom and roseanne arnold! i wish i had a clue what she was thinking when she wrotedirected this disappointing piece of garbage she even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this movie was nothing more than an over-glorified popcorn movie instead of bearing any resemblance to horror with the contrived use of a 3d ending arent those glasses nifty and you get to keep them! its the equivalent of you just spent $900 making me rich heres 10 cents now dont you feel special! sorry but for me it just did not make me feel special and freddys had yet another face-lift this one was for the worst i think all the beautiful artistry that went into his look in the earlier films has been replaced by an obviously cheaper less detailed set of prosthetics he looks less like the burn victim he is supposed to be and more like he has a skin disorder changing the leads makeup like that so far into a series is about on the same level as changing the lead actor but wait! theyve done that and done that so i guess it doesnt matter but it mattered to me freddy is no longer scary hes just another low-rent monster like the leprechaun its morea dark comedy than the horror classic this series promises; riddled with what you can only hope the writers thought were witty one-liners and clever repartee sadly it fell short on both accounts so theres nothing more to say than grab the popcorn and get ready to laugh because there was not one scary or suspenseful moment in this entire film it rates a 3210 fromthe fiend :<SEP>0
tromaville high has become an amoral wasteland of filth thanks to the aftereffects of the nearby nuclear plants accidental release of toxic wasteunrestrained chaos crammed with absurd violence and crude behavior rather horrible obviously intended to be mess of a film with the filmmakers cutting loose the reins allowing the untalented cast free reign to ham it up craft was far down tromas list of objectives for this gory sleazefest the honor society are punks with eerie face paint jobs and wacky outfits the german teacher who becomes a member through a toxic kiss has the streaks down one side of her face that really gave me the creepsthe toxic monster which dispatched the annoying punks towards the end is pretty cool thoughkind of movie trash connoisseurs will embrace wholeheartedly<SEP>0
one of a multitude of slashers that appeared in the early eighties pranks is notable only for an early performance by daphne zuniga the sure thing the fly 2; her character dies fairly early on and the rest of the film is totally forgettableduring their christmas break a group of students volunteer to clear a condemned college building of its furniture a crazy killer however throws a spanner in the works by methodically bumping off the youngsters one by one in a variety of gruesome waysexploiting every stalk n slash cliché in the book director jeffrey obrow delivers a tedious and unexciting horror that had me praying for the characters to be killed so that i could get on with watching something more worthwhile the majority of the deaths which lets face it is why we generally watch this kind of film are brief and not that gory; the only truly grisly imagery comes right at the end when the bodies of the victims are discovered by the remaining survivor there is one notably bloody dismembered corpsethe film couldve done with moreat the last minute the film saves itself from the disgrace of receiving the lowest possible score from me by having a nice unexpectedly downbeat ending but this really is one for slasher completists only<SEP>0
this film had my heart pounding the acting was great the erotic music and the beautiful women add up to make this one a winner the lead actress decides to join an escort service when she realizes that her husband has no time for her she steps into a whole new world her first client being another woman this is a film you definitely dont want to pass up<SEP>1
tainted look at kibbutz lifethis film is less a cultural story about a boys life in a kibbutz but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general in the first two minutes of the movie the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves and its all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical kibbutznikim besides the two main characters a clinically depressed woman and her young son every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of well evil the story centers on how the kibbutz like some sort of cult slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows there is no happiness no joy no laughter in this kibbutz every charactersituation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny hypocrisy violence cultism repression etc for example while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome european looking 12 year old boy  his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his jewish physical appearance and brutish personality he cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother he treats these volunteers like trash after his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasnt seen in a long time due to his military service he orders quote  linda go take shower and i cum in two minutes there is one other good character in this movie  a european foreigner who plays the mothers boyfriend when the animal rapist tries to hit the mothers son the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapists arm he is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for violent behavior against one of the kibbutz members more hypocrisy: the indescribably annoying french woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age 18 or without love and gives an account of the actual act thats supposed to be humorous for the audience but is really just stupid she of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boys mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse the film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders the mother apparently cant escape the kibbutz although in reality anyone wasis always free to come and go as they choose its a mystery how the boys father died but you can rest assured the kibbutz drove him to it and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son thats the gist of this movie one dimensional characters over dramatization dry performances and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audiences head  that kibbutz life was degrading miserable and even deadly for those who didnt fit in i feel sorry for the guy who made this film  obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz but i feel as though he took a few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs<SEP>0
i actually prefer robin williams in his more serious roles eg good will hunting the fisher king the world according to garp these are my favorite robin williams movies but seize the day although well-acted is one of the worst movies ive ever seen and certainly the worst robin williams movie even worse than death to smoochy club paradise and alladin on iceevery good story is going to have its ups and downs this movie however is one giant down i dont need a feel-good hollywood cheese-fest but ive got to have something other than 90 minutes of complete and utter hopelessness this movie reminds me of love liza which is actually worse because it seems that the only point of the movie is to see how far one person can fall the answer who cares<SEP>0
this gloriously turgid melodrama represents douglas sirk at his most high strung it eschews the soft wistfulness of all that heaven allows and the weepy sentimentality of imitation of life and instead goes for feverish angst and overheated tension and of course its all captured in vibrant technicolorthe cornball story has something to do with a friendship between rock hudson and robert stack that becomes a rivalry when hudson snags the affections of lauren bacall but whos really paying attention to the story dorothy malone won a best supporting actress academy award for her splendidly over-the-top performance as stacks sister who takes the family business into her own hands when no one else will a highlight of the film comes when this high-spirited wild child breaks into a frantic dance in her bedroom unable to bear the restraints placed upon her by middle-class propriety as so frequently happens in sirk movies the scene is both unintentionally hilarious in its absurdity and yet strangely moving in its effectivenesssirk came closer than anyone else to turning pure camp into high art satisfying the philistines and the high brows at the same time within the same films his was a unique talent and i dont know that theres ever been another film maker quite like him sincegrade: a-<SEP>1
parsifal 1982 starring michael kutter armin jordan robert lloyd martin sperr edith clever aage haugland and the voices of reiner goldberg yvonne minton wolfgang schone director hans-jurgen syberbergstraight out of the german school of film the kind that favored tons of symbolism and ingmar bergmanesque surrealism came this 1982 film of wagners final masterpiece- parsifal written to correspond with good fridayeaster and the consecration of the bayreuth opera house this film follows the musical score and plot accurately but the manner in which it was filmed and performed is bold and avant-garde and no other parsifal takes the crown in its bizarre cinematography syberberg is known for controversial films prior to this film he had released films about hitler and nazism richard wagner and his personal anti-semitism and a documentary about winifred wagner one of his grand-daughters this film is possibly disturbing in many aspects parsifal sung by reiner goldberg but acted by michael kutter is a male throughout the first part of the film and then after the enchantment of kundrys kiss is transformed into a female this gender-bending element displays the femininemasculineying-yang nature of the quest for the holy grail which serves all mankind and redeems it through christs blood in the pagan sorcerer klingsors fortress there are photographs of such notoriously sinister figures as hitler nietzche cosima wagner and wagners mistress matilde wesendock the swaztika flag hangs outside the fortress parsifal journeys into the 19th and 20th century throughout the film the tempting flower maidens are in the nude kundry is portrayed as a sort of beautiful but corrupt mary magdalene or eve from genesis played by edith clever but beautifully sung by mezzo-soprano yvonne minton ultimately this film is for fans of this type of bizarre germaniceuropean symbolic metafiction and for intellectuals who appreciate the symbolism the history and lovers of wagner opera indeed the singing is grand and compelling reiner goldbergs parsifal is a focused and intense voice but it lacks the depth and overall greatness of the greater parsifals of the stage - james king wolfgang windgassen rene kollo and todays own placido domingo yvone minton is a sensual-voiced dramatic and exciting kundry delving into her tormented state perfectly while the production is certainly unorthodox and as un-wagnerian as it can possibly get wagners concept was christian ceremonial pomp with grails spears castles knights and wounded kings a dark sorcerer darkness turning into light etc typical wagnerian themesit is still an enjoyable art-house film<SEP>1
abysmal with a capital a this has got to be one of if not the unfunniest show on tv right now im about as anti-bush as it gets but this show doesnt even get a chuckle out of me what you think of bush as a president has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not youll like this piece of crap show the jokes are not funny at all for example in a scene when lil bush has his underwear on his head: welcome to camp al-qa-eeda! there is nothing funny about that is it even supposed to be joke the commercials that were shown in the weeks leading up to the show hyping it up were funnier than the show itself and thats just sad hopefully this does not even get considered for a second season it shouldnt even have had a first<SEP>0
this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen its horrible christopher lee is good but he is hardly in it the only the good part is the opening scenedont be fooled by the title end of the world is truly a bad movie i stopped watching it close to the end it was so bad only for die hard b-movie fans that have the brain to stand this vomit<SEP>0
tweaked a little bit nothing could be a childrens film its a very clever concept touches upon some interesting metaphysical themes and goes against pretty much every hollywood convention you can think ofwhat goes against everything more than literally nothing nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives all thats left is what they dont hate and a big empty white space its hard to focus a story on just two actors for the majority of your film especially without any cuts to anything going on outside the plot it focuses on pretty much one subject but thats prime vincenzo natali territory if youve seen cube you know already that he tends to like that type of situation the nothing in this movie is apparently infinite space but natali somehow manages to make it somewhat claustrophobic if only because theres literally nothing else and nowhere else to go the actors sell it although you can tell these guys are friends anyway two actors from cube return here worth and kazan but are entirely different characters they change throughout the story and while theyre not the strongest actors in the world theyre at least believablethe reason i say this could be a childrens film under the right tweaks is because aside from a few f-bombs and a somewhat unnecessary bloody dream sequence the whimsical and often silly feel of this movie could very much be digested easily by kids so i find it an odd choice that the writers decided to add some crass language and a small amount of gore especially considering there isnt very much of it this couldve gotten a pg rating easily had they simply cut a few things out and changed a little dialogue there is very little objectionable about this film but just enough to keep parents from wanting their kids to see it i only say thats a shame because not because i support censorship but because that may have been the only thing preventing this movie from having wider exposureat any rate this is a reasonably entertaining film albeit with a few dragged-out scenes but for literally being about nothing and focused entirely on two characters and their interactions with absolutely nothing they do a surprisingly good job for an independent film<SEP>1
was this tim meadows first acting role in a movie the character leon is funny enough but shortly after that the sexual jokes and humor are too dumb to listen to anymore some movies can get away with the sexual jokes and base their audiences to know that right when the advertising comes on some movies that do this are american pie and scary movie scary movie was stupid and american pie wouldnt have done well without the sexual jokes the only role besides leon that had some humor that followed was will ferrell the character really was dumb and that was all the dumb humor was all that had me watching the movie was ok and nothing else i dont really understand why the snl people that are dying to leave the show always get a movie based on a character they played on the show the skits last about 5 minutes and if they can make a movie off a 5 minute skit then what is the world coming to molly shannon had superstar cheri oterri had scary movie but she wasnt a leading role and will had elf but that was good but he did some dumb movie but i cant remember and mike myers with waynes world how come the mad tv crew dont ever get movie deals seen only one guy break through but only in like 2 movies and a tv show with andy dick but that guy relies on comedy for his life to continue funny or not this movie is not good but had some positive humor what a waste of film and peoples money d d-<SEP>0
star rating: ***** unmissable **** very good *** okay ** you could go out for a meal instead * avoid at all costs stuck-up career bitch kate franka potente heads to the london underground to catch a train to take her to meet george clooney however after a hectic working day she dozes off and awakens to find herself alone in a deserted platform as she races off on a situation taking her from one daunting encounter to the next however she learns of something far more malign and evil waiting for her out therein a lot of ways the british film industry is really becoming one on its own especially in the horror thriller department with films such as creep and the successful 28 days later which this has strong echoes of in parts in terms of succeeding in what it set out to do creep does cleverly create especially at the beginning a scary sense of isolation and tense fear at its clever running time it also though inadvertently i suspect manages to pay homage to some of those pioneer high-concept horror films from the 70s that rely on shocks and fear through-out without really focusing too much on character development and suchof its weaknesses some scenes are a little predictable but these dont really succeed in making it less scary or effective in any way im not sure if the ending was meant to make it come off as some sort of morality play and its not exactly perfect but its certainly very effective and serves its basic function very well ***<SEP>1
